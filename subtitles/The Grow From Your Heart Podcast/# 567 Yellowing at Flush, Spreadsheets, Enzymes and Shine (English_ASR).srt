g13

32
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,959
on the package the flavor is described

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,839
as a coin style

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,959
margarita on the rocks unfortunately or

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
maybe fortunately

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,039
i don't know what a coin style margarita

37
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,079
on the rocks tastes like i'm not an

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,840
alcohol drinker

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,079
i don't consume any alcohol so i haven't

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
had a margarita in at least 10 or 12

41
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,200
maybe 15 years

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,400
don't remember what that tastes like

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,439
couldn't tell you if that's an accurate

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
description or not

45
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,959
what i can tell you is it's [ __ ]

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
delicious if that is an accurate

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,519
description a coin style margarita

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
tastes [ __ ] delicious it is very

49
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,200
lemony it is very citrusy

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
it's got a little bit of a funk to it i

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,478
can actually really taste the lemon g

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,479
that is in the

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,920
blend here but that sugar town i think

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,319
is giving it a really nice

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
sweetness one thing i do really enjoy

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,319
about this concentrate

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
is it kind of [ __ ] me up it makes me uh

58
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,359
like it puts on some blinders it gives

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,118
me like a tunnel vision

60
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,399
it is the kind of concentrate that you

61
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,840

all right i did say i was going to do

138
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,120
some updates in this episode uh in a

139
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,439
previous episode

140
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
i talked about grafting i read a message

141
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,719
from a patreon supporter about grafting

142
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,478
cannabis plants

143
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
and i said that i feel like the genetics

144
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,478
may move around if we

145
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,279
graft multiple plants onto one branch i

146
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,199
said a lot of

147
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,799
uh maybe slightly negative things in my

148
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,079
opinion about grafting that were very

149
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,840
uneducated and i was

150
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,519
very clear that those were my opinions

151
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,359
and i had no education i'd never done it

152
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,359
and i said it seemed silly to me

153
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
i was corrected if i make a grafted

154
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
plant those genetics will not move each

155
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
branch

156
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,439
apparently will stay true to that

157
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,039
genetic somehow the genetics don't move

158
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,959
around i don't understand that part

159
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
i am willing to admit that so i got a

160
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,039
lot of great corrections and updates

161
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
grafting seems to be a viable practice i

162
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
apologize for bashing that

163
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
the genes don't move around uh we

164
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,680
wouldn't have good apples if grafting

165
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,679
wasn't a common practice

166
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,000
now let's move into another update uh we

167
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
had a blind grower

168
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
send us a message shout out to our

169
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,080
friend david in brazil uh send us a

170
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,478
message

171
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,359
saying that they think their plans may

172
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,758
be finishing

173
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,280
too early as soon as that episode went

174
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
out i got a lot of great

175
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,279
feedback so let's do some updates most

176
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,918
of the feedback came from the youtube

177
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,478
channel

178
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,240
and they were great ideas one listener

179
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,800
or viewer since it was from youtube one

180
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
viewer

181
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,199
suggested that since this uh grow is

182
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,320
possibly in brazil

183
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,280
that maybe the equatorial location

184
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,319
is giving those plants super intense sun

185
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,079
and they are finishing

186
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,159
earlier simply because they are getting

187
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,800
more sun more sun is more energy for the

188
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
plants

189
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,478
you've heard me talk about turning my

190
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
light cycle onto 18 6 at the end of

191
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,599
flower the last 10 days

192
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
that way it'll beef up the buds because

193
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
they get more light of course more light

194
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
is more

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,879
energy so yes maybe they are finishing

196
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,719
more quickly because of that intense

197
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,519
mountain sun breeders steve talks about

198
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
some plants

199
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,038
finishing earlier i think he's in south

200
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
america can't remember i think he said

201
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,680
colombia

202
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
that may be where he is breeder steve's

203
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,079
plants finish sooner

204
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
uh in near the equator so that may be a

205
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,599
thing you may be getting that

206
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,120
brighter sun that equatorial sun the

207
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,680
environment is just right

208
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,038
maybe that is one of the reasons why our

209
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,519
friend is getting earlier

210
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,079
finishing plants another thing that we

211
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,038
thought of

212
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,478
is maybe perhaps the and our friend is

213
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,519
blind so he's got a helper who is

214
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,079
helping them

215
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,240
maybe that helper is not looking at

216
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,599
trichomes they stated that the trichomes

217
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
were brown

218
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,080
maybe perhaps we have thought that maybe

219
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
they're not looking at trichomes and

220
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,318
perhaps they're looking at

221
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,479
pistols because pistols do turn brown

222
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
however pistols are not the indicator of

223
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,639
ripeness when it comes to a cannabis

224
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,800
plant

225
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
pistols are basically the sex parts for

226
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
a cannabis plant

227
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,758
and when a cannabis plant passes its

228
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,038
prime time for being bred the pistols

229
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
simply shrivel up

230
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,279
also pistols will shrivel up from

231
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
disruption from moisture from foliar

232
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,918
sprays

233
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,598
from you touching it from an insect

234
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,439
crawling on it from wind

235
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,159
a lot of things will cause pistols to

236
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,879
curl up and basically wither and die

237
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
so possibly we assume we think that

238
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,000
possibly

239
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
this assistant is looking at pistols and

240
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,639
not trichomes

241
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,399
so we need to clarify the difference

242
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,079
between a pistol and a trichome

243
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,839
the things that everybody calls a red

244
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,120
hair those are your pistols

245
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,038
those are the parts where the pollen

246
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,879
will land the pollen will go down that

247
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,680
into an ovule and create a seed inside

248
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,918
of your bud

249
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
that's what that is for a trichome is a

250
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,279
completely different part of the plant

251
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
it is the part that everybody calls the

252
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,799
crystals so you got hairs and crystals

253
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
those are now pistols and trichomes if

254
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
you want to keep up

255
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
the trichomes are what indicate ripeness

256
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
we are smoking

257
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
ripe trichomes we just happen to have

258
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,120
those trichomes delivered to us on a

259
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
green

260
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,038
leafy matter when we make concentrate we

261
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
basically remove the trichomes from the

262
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,759
green leafy matter that's why we get

263
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,519
more lit more easily

264
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,598
there's not as much green stuff to smoke

265
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,279
everything you're smoking is basically

266
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,360
extracted trichomes and the oils from

267
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,959
those trichomes

268
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
so we need to make sure that the

269
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,198
assistant is looking at trichomes and

270
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
not looking at pistols that is a huge

271
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,680
difference

272
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,598
the mushroom things that you see on the

273
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
plant all over the plant the crystals if

274
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,478
you look at them with the scope with the

275
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,919
magnifier they look like mushrooms

276
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,680
they got a stock they have a bulbous

277
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,279
head on them those are the trichomes

278
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,160
those are what we are looking for

279
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,239
we want those in most cases with most

280
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,960
cultivars with most growers for most

281
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
ideal

282
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,638
conditions i can't say all the time

283
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,519
because there's never an all the time in

284
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
cannabis

285
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,918
uh but most of the time most growers

286
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,478
want to harvest when those trichomes

287
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,158
appear to be about 30 percent amber so

288
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,800
if you can get a hundred trichomes in

289
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,319
your view

290
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,559
or if you can look around and see about

291
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
a hundred trichomes you want 30

292
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,039
of those 100 trichomes to be turning in

293
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,399
amber color you will see clear trichomes

294
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,399
you'll see trichomes that have turned

295
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,559
like a milky white color you'll see

296
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
trichomes that are almost a baby blue

297
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,319
they've got like a silver and bluish

298
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
tint to them then you will also see some

299
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
that are starting to turn like a

300
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
brownish color on the inside

301
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
then you'll see some trichomes that look

302
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,159
like they've got dr pepper or soda on

303
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,239
them

304
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,439
those are the ripe trichomes right when

305
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
you start to see those

306
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
dark ones are probably a little bit past

307
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,879
your peak point but

308
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,639
if you've got 30 percent amber trichomes

309
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,159
the rest of the trichomes you've got 70

310
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,519
percent that are going to be right where

311
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,159
you want them to be

312
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
so we want to harvest at 30 percent 25

313
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,919
30 percent amber trichomes

314
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,278
again we need a scope a magnifying glass

315
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,319
to see the color of the heads of the

316
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,399
trichomes

317
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
but that is when we should be harvesting

318
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
i think most of the growers here have

319
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,479
listened to my determining ripeness

320
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
podcast

321
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
so again look at the trichomes not the

322
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,399
hairs that is another thing that we

323
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,879
think

324
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
may be happening in this situation and

325
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,039
again i'm not accusing or making

326
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,958
judgments

327
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,278
these are just ideas that myself and

328
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,278
other growers think may be causing

329
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,720
this issue and it's not really an issue

330
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,958
if the plants are finishing

331
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
too early that means you're getting buds

332
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,599
too early you get to harvest too early

333
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,439
you get your crop

334
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
earlier you're not going to risk a lot

335
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,880
of problems in colorado right now

336
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,440
it was 85 to 100 degrees for a month

337
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,120
straight

338
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
everybody was looking sunburnt and

339
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
looking burned out and sweaty and tired

340
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
from the heat

341
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
then last night it got to 32 degrees

342
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,159
right now i'm looking at my

343
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,039
a little indicator to show me the

344
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,039
temperature it is 36 degrees outside

345
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,719
in the next few days it is going to go

346
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,159
back up is going to go back up to

347
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
probably 80 or 90

348
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,879
degrees all of these giant temperature

349
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,360
swings give us opportunity

350
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,679
for huge problems in the grow here in

351
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
colorado a lot of crops were lost to a

352
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,319
surprise

353
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,159
snowstorm here at the start of september

354
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
we usually don't expect snow until

355
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,120
around halloween

356
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,278
on september 8th and 9th we were hit

357
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,679
with snow a lot of crops were

358
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,759
destroyed outdoors so those people that

359
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,639
have early finishing plants that finish

360
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,078
too early

361
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,078
maybe you're going to get lucky and beat

362
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,679
that early snowstorm you probably don't

363
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,359
have a snowstorm coming in brazil but

364
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,479
you do have something coming

365
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,600
maybe police maybe robbers maybe animals

366
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,039
maybe there's something out there that

367
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
could destroy your crops so if it's down

368
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,000
too

369
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,039
early that means it's down too early uh

370
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
in colorado

371
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,719
we got a lot of crops destroyed by snow

372
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
storms in california

373
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,879
crops are getting destroyed by wildfires

374
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
there is a very good likelihood that

375
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,639
when harvest time comes

376
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,559
maybe only half to a third of the

377
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,199
expected crops outdoors are going to be

378
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,039
cut down

379
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
and brought to the market this year so

380
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,360
there's a very good opportunity and

381
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,000
potential

382
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,759
that prices will rise at the end of this

383
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
year and the start of next year so

384
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,600
people that are used to paying

385
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
that low price for their cannabis [ __ ]

386
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
may go back

387
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
up because of all these natural things

388
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,479
happening the snowstorms ruined a lot of

389
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
money

390
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,839
the fires are burning down a lot of

391
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
money we're going to lose a lot of

392
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,880
cannabis farms to these fires we're

393
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
going to lose a lot of genetics we're

394
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,159
going to lose a lot of important [ __ ] so

395
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,759
while i'm thinking about i want to send

396
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,000
some love to all the people suffering

397
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,519
through

398
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
these [ __ ] fires and snowstorms right

399
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,120
now uh my heart goes out to

400
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
everybody but uh big respect and big

401
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,639
love to all the farmers losing [ __ ]

402
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
all right i need to get myself back the

403
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
[ __ ] on track uh

404
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,360
your crop may be finishing early uh

405
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,519
because of

406
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,800
your equatorial location also you may be

407
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
looking at pistols

408
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,919
not trichomes see i'm getting myself

409
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
back on track it is working

410
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,599
another theory that we think may be

411
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
happening in this grow

412
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,159
is you were saying that the plants are

413
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:14,078
finishing about 21 days too

414
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:16,879
early maybe perhaps you are judging

415
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,599
the first day of flower at the first

416
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,838
sign of

417
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
pistols and not actually the first day

418
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,519
the plants go into flower

419
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,078
if you are seeing pistols and you're

420
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,919
considering that the first day of flower

421
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,359
i would recommend backing your calendar

422
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,559
up about two weeks

423
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,399
it takes about 10 to 14 days to see

424
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,799
pistols on a flowering plant

425
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
in most cases i can't say all the time

426
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,879
every time when it comes to cannabis

427
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
there are always going to be anomalies

428
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,720
most of the time in cannabis we can see

429
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,839
pre-flower

430
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
we can see sex in about 14 days so if

431
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
you're

432
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,919
judging the day one from the time you

433
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
start seeing those pre-flowers those

434
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,639
pistols pop

435
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,560
up you can adjust your calendar your

436
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
schedule by about two weeks and you can

437
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,919
say they've been in flower for two weeks

438
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
longer than what you've been saying

439
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,319
which may

440
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
put you right on the schedule that the

441
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
breeders recommended on the back of

442
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,719
those packages

443
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,799
so those are the things we think may be

444
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
happening you may be uh getting a faster

445
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,599
finishing plant because of your location

446
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,759
on the equator

447
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
you may be looking at pistols and not

448
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,319
trichomes and you may be

449
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,959
judging by the wrong start day of flower

450
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,120
you may be judging day 14 as day one

451
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,199
somewhere around day 10 to 17 you may be

452
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
mistaking that for day one

453
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
maybe i'm not in your grow like i said i

454
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
can't accuse you or blame you on

455
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,680
anything these are just theories that we

456
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,919
think may be happening and we're trying

457
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,679
to help you out so we're sharing ideas

458
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,759
uh check on these three things

459
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,838
see if these three things can be causing

460
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,360
your not problem problem

461
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,040
i don't think it's a problem so there's

462
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,600
nothing to correct here

463
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,719
but maybe like i said before if you were

464
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,959
looking at

465
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,639
pistols and not trichomes we may want to

466
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,439
let these plants go a little bit longer

467
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
so if you're not

468
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,120
looking at the right part of the plant

469
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
to judge maturity maybe you can improve

470
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,198
your crop you didn't say you were happy

471
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,198
with it maybe you could be even happier

472
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,559
uh send me another email let me know if

473
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,838
i helped you out thanks for all the

youtube video or sent me a message

480
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,679
with their theory or their idea of what

481
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,039
they think could be happening in this

482
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,799
person's grow

483
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,078

489
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,679
this exact topic and without you guys

490
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,000
this episode wouldn't have been what it

491
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,599

getting emails and knowing that the

496
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,919
questions i read are actually helping

497
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,240
somebody

498
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,078
i'll write shows about random topics uh

499
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,278
re-vegging or drying and curing i know

500
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:44,799
that stuff will go well

501
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,078
sometimes i get ideas and i'll do a show

502
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,198
and i'm like i wonder if anybody even

503
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,559

546
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,639
i should continue it says i've just

547
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,278
harvested some lemon jeffrey orgasm

548
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
bebop

549
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,958
and the cream you've got a nice

550
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
selection the lemon jeffree's got those

551
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,319
lemon terps the orange

552
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,078
gasm of course the orange terps bebop

553
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,360
has got that cushy possibility if you

554
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,039
get the right phenotypes

555
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,519
and the cream is unique in its own it's

556
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,559
got that root beer cream soda sort of a

557
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
terp to it and if you're making

558
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,479
concentrates the cream is the boss

559
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,560
anyway it goes on it says these plants

560
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,399
blew my freaking mind i

561
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,399
love hearing that they put on some

562
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,159
insane harvest weight

563
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
uh this is good advertising i did not

564
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,679
write this message it says all i had to

565
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,399
do was make sure that all of my girls

566
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,239
were nice and comfy in a trellis netting

567
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,320
with lots of plant steaks for extra

568
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,360
support i'm going to interrupt you

569
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,120
um if you did the trellising

570
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
properly you won't need those extra

571
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,679
supports i'm not trying to dog you not

572
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,278
trying to diss you we're going to

573
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,120
improve your grow right now

574
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,278
where you think you had to add extra

575
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,799
headed i said had it i did that again

576
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,799
not even editing it we're going to keep

577
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,758
moving i say weird [ __ ]

578
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,958
if you uh if you had added i think

579
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,320
that's what i meant to say if you had

580
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,399
added a third net

581
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,679
or to hold those buds up or if you had

582
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
worked those

583
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
uh branches into that net properly you

584
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,639
wouldn't need needed

585
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,079
my words are all [ __ ] up we'll get

586
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,520
back there in a minute you would not

587
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,279
have needed stakes the idea when you're

588
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,240
making a trellis is to get that canopy

589
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,519
nice and even

590
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,000
so the ones that are sticking up that

591
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,279
you needed a stake for probably again i

592
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,078
can't see your grow dude i don't know

593
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,599
what's going on

594
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,198
but you probably could have worked those

595
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,879
branches in just a little bit more and

596
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,240
kept the canopy nice and even

597
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
if you've got a few sticking up or you

598
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
needed a few stakes i would have put

599
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,640
another

600
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
layer did i say it again i don't know i

601
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
would have put another layer of trellis

602
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
net

603
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
to keep all those branches in there but

604
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
i don't know what you're doing

605
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
send me some pictures i think you did

606
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,678
i'm going to look at your pictures and

607
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,359
see if we can help you out

608
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,038
anyway let's continue with this email

609
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,719
just wanted to talk about the trellising

610
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,400
get them even the idea is to get a nice

611
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,798
even canopy get those sticks out of

612
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
there

613
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,839
of course if you need them that may be a

614
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
good thing i can't see your grow

615
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,918
let's stay focused since i dialed my in

616
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
my environment and i feed all of my

617
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,720
girls

618
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,079
uh the feed just went as wild as i

619
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
wanted them to do

620
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,319
they fattened up all the way up till

621
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,119
harvest but i was not able

622
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,918
to get all of my plants to yellow and

623
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,359
flush

624
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,038
all right so the grow went great it

625
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,199
sounds like everything went well

626
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,240
but during the flush phase the plants

627
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
did not yellow

628
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
as expected i don't find that to be a

629
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,759
problem

630
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,519
but it goes on to say i was literally

631
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,679
flooding them for two weeks and i only

632
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,599
got a couple of plants to yellow

633
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,798
if some of my plants didn't yellow at

634
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,399
all

635
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,160
even though i flushed the [ __ ] out of

636
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,519
them does that mean i still have a lot

637
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
of nutrients trapped

638
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:37,119
in my buds i was growing in soil with

639
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,038
1200 ppms in flowering by the time i got

640
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,079
done with my flush my runoff was very

641
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,038
low for soil

642
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,038
i think 110 ppms and this is combined

643
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,400
runoff from multiple plants that were

644
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,798
flushed all right this is a very good

645
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,720
and unique question a lot of people when

646
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,440
they flush their plants they expect and

647
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,759
want to see

648
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,279
the plants start to turn yellow they

649
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,759
think we're flushing the nutrients out

650
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,119
of here

651
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,480
these plants should turn yellow they

652
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,719
should start fading and showing me their

653
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,919
fall colors they're about to die

654
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,000
that is not always necessary you do not

655
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,520
have to get yellow dead crispy looking

656
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
plants at the end of your grow they can

657
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,440
be nice and green and lush

658
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
they don't have to be yellow and crunchy

659
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
and faded

660
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,519
it's really cool it looks really nice i

661
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,079
love taking pictures when they start

662
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,599
turning

663
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,038
like a little bit of golden colors at

664
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,879
the end they get those red hues the

665
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,480
purples start coming in

666
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
but they don't have to fade some

667
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,519
genetics will not fade no matter

668
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,798
i guess they all fade no matter what you

669
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,519
do to them they'll run out of nutrients

670
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,440
eventually

671
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,558
but some they just look happy right up

672
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
to the end

673
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,399
um how's the smoke that's what meant

674
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,000
really matters did you cut them down

675
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
have you dried them and cured them

676
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
how do they smoke uh the dry and cure

677
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,038
process is really going to play a huge

678
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,038
role in this but

679
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,319
does it smoke well does it smoke harshly

680
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,000
does it smoke smoothly

681
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,519
does it taste good does the ash burn

682
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,119
white is the ash chunky

683
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,879
if you roll it into a joint or pack it

684
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,199
into a bowl and take a few hits off of

685
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
it

686
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
does the part you smoke turn into like a

687
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,038
charcoal briquette or does it turn into

688
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,519
a white

689
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,079
flaky soft ash that's really the way to

690
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,079
judge

691
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,599
if it was flushed properly or not and if

692
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,399
you dried and cured it those two things

693
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,719
are going to come into

694
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
interplay together at the end here so

695
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,440
it's all about how's the smoke

696
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,038
you say you were trying to uh get all of

697
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
the nutrients out does it mean you still

698
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,158
have nutrients trapped in my buds

699
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,558
i don't there's a lot of controversy

700
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
around

701
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,879
flushing and not flushing right now and

702
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,480
i'm trying not to pick a side i'm trying

703
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
to stay open-minded as somebody who

704
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,599
teaches and shares

705
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,359
information i can't pick a side i can't

706
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,959
be biased in this topic because i don't

707
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,439
have enough information

708
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,279
but when i think about flushing i think

709
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,720
that i'm trying to clean out

710
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,079
the soil or the medium to get that clean

711
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
so that the plants don't have any more

712
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,599
to eat just they're gonna

713
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,279
they're going to simply quit eating

714
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,038
there are nutrients and sugars

715
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,918
stored throughout the plant mainly in

716
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,158
the leaves but the stuff in the buds

717
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,000
i feel like that has been metabolized

718
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,320
and converted into

719
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,720
buds it's no longer nitrogen phosphorous

720
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,678
potassium aluminum calcium magnesium

721
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,839
boron

722
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
several other nutrients and elements it

723
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,439
is now bud material

724
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,480
like today i nobody cares what i ate i

725
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,279
had food today

726
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,279
that food is not food inside of me it is

727
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,918
now in my blood it's becoming

728
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,359
muscle tissue skin not much muscle i'm

729
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,120
[ __ ] skinny but it's trying

730
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,119
uh it's making muscle tissue it's making

731
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,479
skin it's making my blood move it's

732
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,038
providing me vitamins

733
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,159
those so there's vitamin c and iron in

734
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,279
my food today

735
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,960
uh i am not i'm not iron and vitamin c

736
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,038
right now there's a lot of those things

737
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,798
that have turned into parts of me that

738
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,200
have become part of me

739
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,000
and i when i go pee or poop it's not

740
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,759
going to be

741
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,119
vitamin c and iron that comes out it's

742
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,679
not going to be like that

743
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,279
i don't think i i know i got way off

744
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,720
track on that but i don't think that the

745
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,639
buds are the nutrient they've converted

746
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
into buds now it's not just nitrogen and

747
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
phosphorus and potassium so you can't

748
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,079
really

749
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,280
wash that out of the buds in my opinion

750
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,359
i don't have science behind this i'm

751
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,119
trying to explain my theory so that

752
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,199
stuff has turned into

753
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,879
you you mixed up a and b and now you've

754
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,519
got c and you can't wash a and b

755
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
back out or you would just lose c and i

756
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,400
understand that you want to rinse the

757
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,759
nutrients out so the buds burn

758
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,120
cleanly but i think if you flushed and

759
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,919
even if they're not showing you that

760
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,839
they're angry

761
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
you're not going to smoke the leaves so

762
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,399
the leaves don't need to change colors

763
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,079
as long as the

764
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
the plants are flushed and they've

765
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,879
stopped eating they've metabolized all

766
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,320
the stuff in there

767
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,200
and turned anything that was in the

768
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,359
plant system into smokable buds

769
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,319
that is my theory i don't have science

770
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,479
behind that

771
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,240
i can't prove that but that's what i'm

772
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
thinking you're not going to smoke those

773
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
leaves

774
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,759
so why are you watching for the leaves

775
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
to change colors other than it looks

776
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,759
[ __ ] great

777
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,279
it's really beautiful and you've got a

778
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,240
nice row of plants and they've got that

779
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,879
fall colors

780
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,679
that's my fall color [ __ ] photograph

781
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
right there if i was going to make a

782
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
postcard for somebody it'd be

783
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,678
fall color cannabis leaves but um you're

784
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,000
just trying to get the plants to stop

785
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,280
eating and use up the stored food

786
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
you can't remove that part from the

787
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,879
plant in my opinion i don't have science

788
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
behind this i am still learning you guys

789
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
just like you guys

790
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,440
i'm still learning i may be learning on

791
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
a different level and learning different

792
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,360
things

793
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
but i am still learning i don't feel

794
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,359
like i know it all i'll never know at

795
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
all

796
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,639
that's one of the great things about

797
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
cannabis when i learn something i go oh

798
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
that's really cool

799
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,879
and then i realized that that makes me

800
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,559
able to learn

801
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
two more things and when i learn those

802
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,918
two things i gotta learn

803
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,080
three more [ __ ] things to understand

804
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
those two things to be able to put those

805
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,119
three things with the first two things i

806
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,240
learned back with some old school [ __ ]

807
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,158
and then i go oh man

808
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,599
my head explodes and i just learned 12

809
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,039
new [ __ ] things on accident

810
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,879
it's like an epiphany every day in the

811
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,319
grow for me i love learning you guys and

812
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
i'm glad that you want to learn with me

813
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,879
and from me

814
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,558
i'm [ __ ] high as [ __ ] from that coin

815
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,280
style live batter so i'm gonna get

816
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,440
myself

817
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,599
back on track here i think your plants

818
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
will be great you flushed for two weeks

819
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,678
uh your runoff and your ppm was very low

820
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,200
so your plants aren't eating

821
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,640
they've cannibalized themselves they've

822
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,278
eaten all the nutrients that were left

823
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
over

824
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,440
now i want to know how was the smoke

825
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,359
i've seen pictures of the grow

826
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,480
i've gotten a report on the grow i know

827
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,558
that you flushed

828
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,839
this message came in a little bit ago i

829
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,918
want to know how

830
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,359
did this crop turn out also i owe you an

831
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,880
apology because it took me a long time

832
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,879
to get this message on the show

833
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720

00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,599
times

875
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,119

876
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,439

878
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
goes on

879
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,919
it says i have a few questions for you i

880
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,200
recently listened to episode

881
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,880
404 grow lessons part four

882
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,798
man you are way behind but thank you for

883
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,278
listening it says i heard you talk about

884
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,200
the shine a few times uh one of my

885
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:35,919
questions is on the shine so shine is a

886
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
product

887
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,080
from uh it's hydroponic research they

888
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,599
make the veg bloom line

889
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,519
i recommend the shine it's a great

890
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,558
product that says i'm wondering what

891
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,038
weeks of bloom

892
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,599
do you recommend using the shine i know

893
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,839
you said

894
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,519
using it a week before a flower should

895
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,359
help stop initial stretch

896
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,278
also used during the first five days of

897
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,359
flush i also heard you mention that some

898
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,440
kind of enzyme would be good to add

899
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,558
at the end with the shine i'm using

900
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
advanced nutrients

901
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,558
so what i need to use scentsy zyme as my

902
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
enzymes there's a lot of good stuff to

903
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,879
talk about here and this

904
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,599
so let me back up what weeks of bloom do

905
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,360
you recommend

906
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,719
shine and they remembered that i

907
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,798
recommend using it

908
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,038
uh the week before you start flower to

909
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,558
help stop initial stretch

910
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,240
shine is not a cheap product it's got a

911
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,798
good price tag on it so

912
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,919
a lot of people use shine sparingly or

913
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,879
as needed

914
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,960
i use shine extra and i find that if

915
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
i've got plants that are super stretchy

916
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
at the beginning of flower if i give

917
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
them a product called shine

918
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
right before flower and through the

919
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,759
beginning of flower they do not stretch

920
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,679
as much give them half of the

921
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,440
recommended dose or the recommended dose

922
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,640
which i think is a gram or two per

923
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
gallon of water

924
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,759
uh start off small you don't need to

925
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,278
give it a lot just have the presence of

926
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,640
shine in there at the beginning

927
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,839
and they'll say oh we're going to get

928
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,278
fed real well i don't need to stretch

929
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,399
real hard there's plenty of nutrients i

930
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,440
don't need to go crazy

931
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,200
they don't stretch as much also like i

932
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,038
said before the product is not free

933
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
it's a little bit spendy if you don't

934
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,319
want to start early

935
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,519
and spend an extra three or two weeks

936
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,359
using the shine

937
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,038
that is when you start at the beginning

938
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,079
of week three you can start a week two

939
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,839
or week three

940
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,599
the earlier the better in my opinion but

941
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,038
get it in there by the start of week

942
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,918
three that is when you need it

943
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,200
in there uh before flower will help

944
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,559
reduce stretch

945
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,319
having it in there at the beginning of

946
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,278
flower will help reduce stretch having

947
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,359
it in there early

948
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,519
will help start trichome development

949
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,079
earlier start packing on thicker denser

950
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,558
buds

951
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,119
so um it's kind of up to your budget and

952
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,639
how many

953
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,558
things you want to be mixing in your

954
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,919
ppms your growth style

955
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,440
that's kind of what it's up to how much

956
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,200
shine do you have access to what's your

957
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,200
budget i said that already

958
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,319
but that's how i use it if you want to

959
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
go early it will

960
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,079
help stop with the stretch also to help

961
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,720
stop with stretch crack and twist those

962
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,398
plants

963
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,000
i talk about popping and twisting you

964
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,000
basically grab it one spot

965
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,839
grab another twist your hands opposite

966
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,839
directions kind of gently until you hear

967
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,519
a pop it should sound like

968
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,439
should sound like a knuckle popped once

969
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,000
you hear that sound just move up do it

970
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
again

971
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
do that all over the entire plant give

972
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,278
it knuckles burl it up real well

973
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,960
that plant will spend most of its energy

974
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,720
fixing those broken knuckles

975
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,159
and it's not going to slow down anything

976
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,278
other than the vertical growth we're not

977
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
making buds yet

978
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,359
the plant is still realizing oh it's

979
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
flower time i need to transition

980
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,319
from vegging to flower so the hormones

981
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,519
are moving around the plants trying to

982
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,000
figure out what to do

983
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,440
it'll get into flour in about 14 days

984
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
crack it pop it twist it

985
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,038
just before flower right at the start of

986
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,558
flower and then about week three

987
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,158
then keep going if you want to that'll

988
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,839
stop your stretch from getting too out

989
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,960
of control so add the shine

990
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:37,278
and then crack and twist it says also

991
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
use during the first five days of flush

992
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,558
yes if you're in coco

993
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,919
and you're gonna flush for about 14 days

994
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,000
you can add shine

995
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,360
with your flush but make sure you flush

996
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,798
hard at the end to get that out of there

997
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,038
that is kind of a uh

998
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,960
a more advanced grower technique some

999
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,640
beginner growers may burn the plants or

1000
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,319
have a shitty tasting product

1001
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,919
if they try to go too hard at the end

1002
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,398
but if you're flushing

1003
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,240
you can use about two grams of shine for

1004
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,119
the lat for the first five days of the

1005
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,359
flush cycle

1006
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,719
if you're going to flush for 14 days do

1007
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,599
that if you're you got to add time to

1008
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,000
the flush phase

1009
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,519
so just clean water and shine then i

1010
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
said that i could add some kind of an

1011
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,240
enzyme to the flush phase

1012
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
uh yes i like enzymes during flush again

1013
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
this is kind of budget

1014
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,759
uh according budget friendly if if

1015
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
you've got an unlimited budget and you

1016
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,640
can buy some enzymes

1017
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
if you've got a big grow enzymes get

1018
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,600
expensive if you have a little tiny grow

1019
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,359
enzymes aren't that expensive you could

1020
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,918
buy a bottle of hydrozyme or scentsy

1021
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,240
zyme

1022
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,080
and they'll go a long way if it fits

1023
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,519
your budget flush with some enzymes for

1024
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,439
the first week or so

1025
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,798
what that will do is the enzymes get in

1026
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,320
the root zone and break down all the

1027
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,519
[ __ ] and help clean out that root

1028
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,240
zone so as you're flushing you're

1029
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,558
getting out

1030
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,798
everything you guys that recycle your

1031
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,480
cocoa or soil that's a really good idea

1032
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,918
to make sure that all the small roots

1033
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
all the dead stuff all the decaying

1034
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,159
matter in there

1035
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,080
gets broken down and cleaned out of your

1036
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,240
root zone before you recycle that

1037
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,278
so i do recommend an enzyme in there i

1038
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,960
like enzymes

1039
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,119
a lot in my grow it really helps out

1040
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,360
does a lot of things keeps the soil

1041
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,798
safe and healthy a little bit of enzymes

1042
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,240
a little bit of plus life together your

1043
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:05,839
soil will be really happy lots of

1044
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,038
microbes in there with that obviously

1045
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,199
every time

1046
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,640
but i do like enzymes the next part of

1047
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
the question is i'm using advanced

1048
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
nutrients

1049
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,639
so what i need to use scentsy zyme as my

1050
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,798
enzyme no

1051
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,799
absolutely not there's no need to stick

1052
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,079
with that brand specific nutrient

1053
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,599
just because you're using advanced

1054
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,558
nutrients does not mean you have to use

1055
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,719
scentsy zyme

1056
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,558
uh you can use any enzyme product out

1057
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,399
there that fits your budget fixture

1058
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,319
fits your growth style or is simply

1059
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,519
available at your local grow store some

1060
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,960
products are harder to get

1061
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,879
some people don't like to shop online

1062
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,038
they don't want amazon showing up

1063
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
i ordered a carbon filter and they

1064
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,038
brought me a carbon filter

1065
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,880
with no like wrapping around it it was

1066
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,720
just said carbon filter and i was like

1067
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,399
[ __ ] i didn't need that delivered here

1068
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,000
but it came that way so i don't like to

1069
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,199
order some things from amazon

1070
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
here's a trick if you're going to order

1071
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
something from amazon like a carbon

1072
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,519
filter

1073
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,558
there's a box that says this order this

1074
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,079
item is a gift

1075
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,759
click it as a gift and they'll wrap it

1076
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,158
for you now when it shows up at your

1077
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,759
house

1078
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
it's [ __ ] wrapped and it's not

1079
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,960
showing that this is a carbon filter

1080
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,798
this is a box of nutrients

1081
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
that'll help you out get that [ __ ] gift

1082
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,918
wrapped all right

1083

a single piece of punctuation in this

1148
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,399
whole message that's why it was hard to

1149

read

1150
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,918

and north is asking for a copy of my

1158

document and i make a custom document

1162
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,759
for

1163
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,440
anything that i'm doing so right now

1164
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,319
i've got a document that says

1165
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,840
room a and then that's a column and then

1166
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,319
on the side it's just the date

1167
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,599
and then on the date i will put uh so on

1168
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,519
right here it's like september

1169
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,359
first second third fourth and then in

1170
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
room a i've got the

1171
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,479
ph and ec of the water going into the

1172
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,159
plants

1173
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
and the next graph is the water coming

1174
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,519
out of the plants so it's uh room a

1175
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,519
and roommate out and i just know that

1176
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,919
the google doc is actually labeled room

1177
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,240
a

1178
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,840
and the first two columns are in and out

1179
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,120
and then every day i just know that in

1180
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,000
and out that's what's going in and out

1181
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,678
of those plants

1182
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,519
and i just make and create google

1183
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,519
documents that work for my mind for my

1184
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,639
grow style for my brain for my phone for

1185
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,000
my ipad

1186
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,679
i just build them like that they work

1187
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,358
for me so i don't really have

1188
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,039
custom spreadsheets or anything i guess

1189
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,358
they're all just custom for me

1190
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,279
so my advice is learn how to use google

1191
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,440
documents a lot of businesses a lot of

1192
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,040
the future is on google docs so

1193
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,720
learn how to use google docs get that

1194
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,519
figured out and just create your own

1195
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,199
custom spreadsheets you'll or open uh

1196
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,838
what is it google spreadsheets google

1197
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,039
docs

1198
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:32,799
you learn to use both of those and

1199
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,878
you'll start utilizing it to the best of

1200
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,480
your ability uh you're gonna have to

1201
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,000
get your thumbs figured out because it

1202
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,519
does require a little bit better typing

1203
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,679
in those small boxes but

1204
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,039
i think you'll be able to figure it out

1205
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,440
the add

1206
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,679
doesn't make it easier by using a google

1207
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,878
doc because you go to open your phone

1208
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,320
and now you've opened your phone and

1209
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,679
then you see that i put out a new show

1210
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,679
and now instead of making a google doc

1211
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
you're watching my next podcast

1212
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,440
but i think you'll figure it out bro

1213
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,800
i've got faith in you i'll just open up

1214
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
a google document or a google

1215
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,440
spreadsheet

1216
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,760
start poking around it's free you can't

1217
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
[ __ ] it up it may be easier for you on a

1218
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,280
computer you can also

1219
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,200
share the same document if you log into

1220
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,800
google docs with your email address

1221
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,639
whatever it is north north terps at

1222
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,400
[ __ ] north terps.com

1223
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,239
log in on your computer log in on your

1224
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
mobile device you can get the same

1225
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,879
spreadsheet on the same on your both

1226
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,880
devices

1227
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,720
it's much easier to do the spreadsheets

1228
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,920
on the computer sometimes especially if

1229
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,480
you're missing a finger

1230
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,480
i may help you out so i wish i had more

1231
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
templates or more advice for you but

1232
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,159
honestly i just create my own google

1233
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
spreadsheets and google docs and

1234
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,078
write what i need to write uh not a lot

1235
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,959
of it happens on paper anymore because

1236
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,519
like yourself

1237
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,480
i've got scribbly handwriting and also

1238
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,400
uh paper just

1239
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,400
makes piles and gets [ __ ] a mess in

1240
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,599
the grow so most of it's in google docs

1241
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
google spreadsheets

1242
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
and then it's there forever and then

1243
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,000
it's in my computer it's in my ipad it's

1244
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,519
on my iphone

1245
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,960
and then if i go to another computer if

1246
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,920
i go to another facility and i want to

1247
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,760
look at something

1248
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,960
all i have to do is get a computer log

1249
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,640
into my google account

1250
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,559
open up my google spreadsheets and i can

1251
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,239
look right there also you can share

1252
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,000
those documents and spreadsheets

1253
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,519
so if i've got i've got a couple of guys

1254
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,280
that run a grow on a weekend

1255
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,880
and i'll have questions and i'll be like

1256
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
hey did you do the to-do list and

1257
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
instead of asking them

1258
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,679
i can open up a to-do list and see if a

1259
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,880
guy has put his initials

1260
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,480
next to the task because that's what i

1261
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,920
have to do put your initials next to it

1262
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,119
tell me if it's done correctly or wrong

1263
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,079
i know who the praise are [ __ ]

1264
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,240
kicking the balls

1265
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,359
so it's got their initials i did it i

1266
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,039
did it and i can see

1267
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,719
i don't even have to bug anybody we

1268
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,239
share those google documents together i

1269
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,039
can edit it they can see the edits in

1270
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,479
real time

1271
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,920
so i can put hey you guys go to lunch

1272
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,599
you've been working too hard and they'll

1273
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,358
get a notification that the document has

1274
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
been edited they'll go oh boss said go

1275
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,400

1276
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,599
they'll go to lunch then i'll put

1277
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,639
something funny in there when they're at

1278
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,920
lunch when they come back they'll check

1279
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,118
the document again

1280
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
they'll find out who got to clean the

1281
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,920
toilets at the end of the day because i

1282
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,719
watch them stand around on camera

1283
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,240
so google documents uh google

1284
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,039
spreadsheets they're free

1285
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,039
they're super easy uh customize it for

1286
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,279
yourself if you've got add

1287
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,719
my documents may not work for you make

1288
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
those documents yourself

1289
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,319
make it work for your brain if you have

1290
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,079
to bro just write it on paper

1291
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,240
as long as you're taking notes and

1292
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,000
making some sort of documentation

1293
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,838
maybe get a calendar maybe an old school

1294
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,239
