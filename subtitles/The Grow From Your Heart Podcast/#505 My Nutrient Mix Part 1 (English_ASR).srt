patreon doesn't bring us up in the

73
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,149

74
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,180
the link in the show notes so big thanks

75
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,430
to everybody who helps out on patreon

76
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,099
all right podcast world now it is time

77
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,099
for you to bust out a notebook and a pen

78
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:22,159
or pencil or maybe bust open a note app

79
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:27,469
on your phone because I am going to do a

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,930
very detailed lesson on my very specific

81
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:31,909
nutrient mix there's a lot to this

82
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,950
episode I will try to be as clear as

83
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:36,229
possible I will try to give as many

84
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,449
details as possible I also want to make

85
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:41,299
it easy for everybody to understand so

86
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,669
I'll try not to ramble too much but you

87
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,310
know me so ladies and gentlemen with no

88
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:50,089
further ado let's take a deep dive into

89
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,789
my nutrient mix before we get into this

90
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,400
I want to say that nobody pays me to

91
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:58,189
advertise their nutrients or products I

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,459
do not have any paid sponsors or

93
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:04,400
advertisers on this episode everything I

94
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,519
am talking about is because I really do

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,450
use this in a commercial grow setting or

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,459
in my personal grow setting none of this

97
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:16,608
is product placement none of this is

98
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,319
advertising this is the Rasta Jeff grow

99
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,449
style this is what I do

100
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,848
so please don't think I'm doing this

101
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,860
episode just to sell you some products

102
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:26,990
just to be a shill for some company I'm

103
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,490
going to mention a lot of specific

104
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,038
products and a lot of very specific

105
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,340
brands none of those brands or companies

106
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:37,370
or people paid me anything to do this

107
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,348
episode this is an episode to help my

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,810
listeners because a lot of people are

109
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:44,000
very curious about what I do in my grow

110
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,370
in my specific grow they want to know my

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,500
specific stuff so here it is I'm going

112
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,509
to tell you what I do in my grow I'm

113
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,889
going to tell you a lot of things that I

114
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,960
have learned through a lot of

115
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,210
experimentation through a lot of trial

116
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,948
and error through buying and trying a

117
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,529
lot of different products through

118
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,389
reading a lot of forums I've learned a

119
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:04,908
lot by doing a lot of side-by-side

120
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,620
comparisons I've got the advantage of

121
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:08,149
working in multiple commercial

122
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,610
environments and that means I've got

123
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,679
facilities all over Colorado where I can

124
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,509
do experiments and as long as the plants

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,240
come out happy and we reach our goals I

126
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,069
am able to play with the nutrient mixes

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,840
and the gross styles a little bit at

128
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,908
each facility and see what works and

129
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,978
what does not work I have also been

130
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:27,199
growing and experimenting with nutrient

131
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:29,060
regiments in my own personal gardens for

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,038
countless years we won't even talk about

133
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,990
how long because I may allegedly have

134
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,269
started doing that before we had any

135
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,978
type of legalization so I've been mixing

136
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,139
nutrients and experimenting with

137
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,149
products for quite a while this is what

138
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,550
I have discovered works best for me and

139
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:45,859
my personal grow as well as in a

140
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,560
commercial environment I've also found

141
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,770
that these types of nutrient mixes are

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,870
very replicable I can write SOPs for

143
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,788
these I can do a podcast for these mixes

144
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,728
and I can teach people how to do it on a

145
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,529
very consistent basis which comes in

146
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:02,359
very handy when I'm training people in a

147
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,098
commercial environment let me get myself

148
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,658
back on track because I did say I was

149
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:08,000
going to try not to ramble a lot my

150
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,430
point here is that nobody is paying me

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,050
to do this episode nobody has paid me in

152
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,879
nutrients nobody has given me anything

153
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,310
this is what I'm doing and I want to

154
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,098
share it with you so let's talk about my

155
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,129
nutrient mix again this works for me

156
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:23,839
this may not be perfect for you but I

157
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,490
have learned that this mix and this

158
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,198
gross style works very well

159
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,810
for what I am trying to do in a

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,788
commercial and in a home grow type

161
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,939
environment in a commercial environment

162
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:38,000
I like to use cocoa as my base for my

163
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,670
small plants I will use 70 to 80 percent

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,339
cocoa and 20 to 30

165
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,860
sent perlite I think that having 20 to

166
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,229
30 percent perlite and my cocoa makes a

167
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,000
nice fluffy aerated mix if we do

168
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,890
overwater those pots we don't have to

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,290
worry about all of that cocoa compacting

170
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,829
and crushing and suffocating my roots so

171
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:01,790
for the smaller plants I do 70% cocoa

172
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:04,219
and 30 percent perlite for my larger

173
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:08,150
plants in three gallon pots I like to

174
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:11,450
use 70% cocoa and 20 percent perlite and

175
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:14,149
10 percent per so light per so light is

176
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,949
basically larger and chunkier perlite

177
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,419
when you're mixing the three gallon pots

178
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,670
when you're mixing large batches

179
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,550
it really helps fill it it also adds a

180
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,500
very nice aeration to the mix that way

181
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,139
again if somebody in the cultivation

182
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,000
facility does over water those plants we

183
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,919
don't suffocate those roots with that

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,170
compacted cocoa we've got plenty of

185
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,189
perlite and plenty of perlite in the

186
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:40,160
containers so ideally we would have 70%

187
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,980
cocoa 20 percent perlite and 10 percent

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,930
personal life if you do not have access

189
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,850
to the purse light if you don't want to

190
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,850
add the personal light to your mix just

191
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,920
do 25 percent perlite and your plants

192
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,140
will be happy the cocoa will be plenty

193
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,660
aerated for you I will give a lot more

194
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,240
detail about pot sizes later but I

195
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,910
generally start from a clone I use an EZ

196
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,930
cloner I go from the EZ cloner into a 4

197
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:08,060
or 6 inch net pot with that 70 to 30%

198
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,340
mix then once the plants are large

199
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,280
enough I move them into a 3 gallon

200
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:15,469
fabric pot and that 3 gallon fabric pot

201
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,079
that's where I like to use the 70% cocoa

202
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,690
20 percent perlite 10 percent

203
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,060
personalized very well mixed up in the

204
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,339
three gallon pots in my commercial

205
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,319
environment I finish in the three gallon

206
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,479
pots I like the time that it takes those

207
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,699
pots to dry down I'm able to get two

208
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,009
waterings in a day on a very large plant

209
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,169
and I'm able to fit enough pots on a

210
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,729
table I don't see a need to do larger

211
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,189
pots I don't see a need for more

212
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,680
transplants so I generally go from the

213
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,480
cloner to a 6-inch net pot to a three

214
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,669
gallon pot and that is that plant

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,009
forever pot that's its finishing home

216
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:51,229
while I am talking about cocoa and

217
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:53,480
mixing your perlite and purse alight one

218
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,050
thing I should mention for you is make

219
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,570
sure you rinse your cocoa make sure you

220
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:03,139
rinse your perlite make sure you rinse

221
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,670
your purse alight also wear a mask when

222
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,190
you are playing with the perlite and

223
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:09,439
purse alight we need to rinse all of

224
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,529
these products because they are dirty

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,389
that cocoa was made overseas it's a

226
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:15,889
bunch of cocoa husks it was crushed

227
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:18,769
together put into a container and

228
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,990
shipped to the States on a ship it may

229
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,448
have a bunch of salts in it it may have

230
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,220
a bunch of unknown stuff in it I don't

231
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:29,179
know who you were buying your cocoa from

232
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,860
some companies have very salty cocoa so

233
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:33,588
rinse that out before you put your

234
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,409
plants in it or you will shock burn and

235
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,660
kill your plants I also recommend you

236
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,480
rinse your perlite and your purse alight

237
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,129
I also recommend you wear that dust mask

238
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,839
when you're working with the perlite and

239
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,850
personal life because you don't want to

240
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,930
breathe in that little dust that comes

241
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,120
off of that stuff

242
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:52,458
it is like inhaling glass it cannot be

243
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,740
good for you please take care of

244
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,289
yourself alright so we have covered the

245
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,240
pots we usually use a cloner I like to

246
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,828
use a clone machine or clone plugs we'll

247
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,740
talk more about that then I go into that

248
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:06,909
4 or 6 inch net pot we've got my 70 to

249
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,459
30% mix then I will go into a 3 gallon

250
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:12,860
fabric pot where I use that 70 20 10

251
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,679
percent mix and my reminder once again

252
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,629
rinse all of your stuff your cocoa your

253
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,370
perlite your purse alight make sure you

254
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,439
rinse all the excess salt out of your

255
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,959
cocoa wash all that dust off the perlite

256
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,190
and personal light and wear a mask when

257
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,958
you're playing with the perlite and

258
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,670
personal light alright I feel like we've

259
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,879
got the containers covered we are making

260
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:34,068
great progress on this episode in my

261
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,679
commercial environments I like to make

262
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:39,349
an auto watering system there are many

263
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,870
variations on an auto watering system in

264
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,610
some places I have machines mixing

265
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,190
nutrients and know people have to even

266
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,620
touch it little machines spit out this

267
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,170
much cal-mag this much nitrogen this

268
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,970
much phosphorus into a reservoir a mixer

269
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:55,250
mixes it up for me another machine

270
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,110
measures the pH if it's too low or too

271
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,208
high it spits in the appropriate up or

272
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,680
down then it feeds that to the plants

273
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,719
it's got a little sensor in some of the

274
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,489
plants when that moisture meter gets to

275
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,528
the right meter it stops watering when

276
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,590
it gets to dry out waters again some

277
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:09,750
facilities are

278
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,030
very automated some of them we've got to

279
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,340
mix up the tanks ourselves then we plug

280
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,309
in a pump and that pump waters but in

281
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,350
all situations in all flower rooms it is

282
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,839
ideal that I have got some sort of a

283
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,870
drip feed or sprinkler or emitter or

284
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,030
auto water system in all flower rooms it

285
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,850
is so much easier it is much more

286
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:32,069
consistent and the plants really enjoy

287
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,649
and appreciate that type of consistency

288
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,210
in timing and how much water they get

289
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,889
and when you use the right type of

290
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,019
emitter or sprinkler

291
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,480
I think you really add just enough

292
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,909
oxygen to the mix to make the plants go

293
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,620
Kapow when you water them so in my

294
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:49,409
commercial environments I have always

295
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,500
got my flowering plants on some type of

296
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:55,049
an auto watering system depending on the

297
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,570
size of my plants and how old the plants

298
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,009
are and the environment of the room

299
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,650
sometimes the plants get watered once

300
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,629
per day I like to water right as the

301
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,699
lights come on I like to water within

302
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:07,590
the first hour of the lights coming on

303
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,420
if I can we are in a commercial

304
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,190
environment sometimes we've got multiple

305
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,289
rooms sometimes we've got a lot of

306
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,970
plants sometimes we can't water every

307
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,919
room right at nine o'clock because we

308
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,180
can't be in every single room so when

309
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,860
the lights come on at 8:00 or run the

310
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,539
lights come on at 9:00 I try to water

311
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,100
this room as quickly as I can then get

312
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,750
to this one and then get to this one and

313
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,790
get all of the plants watered within an

314
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,340
hour of the lights coming on so they can

315
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:31,019
use all of that water all day metabolize

316
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,330
all of those nutrients to just get to

317
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,159
work and get to action and honestly in a

318
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,379
commercial environment by the time the

319
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,969
lights come on those plants are usually

320
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,919
ready for a drink of water they've had a

321
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,840
long night they've been growing there's

322
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,399
been a lot of activity they're hungry

323
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,100
they are thirsty so I like to water

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,289
right when the lights come on then if

325
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,850
the plants are large enough if you work

326
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,799
in a commercial environment you might

327
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,600
want to water right before you leave

328
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,609
that way they aren't dead when you come

329
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,350
back the next morning so based on the

330
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,659
size of the plants and a three gallon

331
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,550
pot I'm usually watering first thing in

332
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,829
the morning and then later in Flour I'm

333
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,669
watering right as we leave for the end

334
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:11,790
of the day I like to water my plants to

335
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:14,429
20% runoff I want runoff every time I

336
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:16,799
feed and water those plants and since

337
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:18,929
I'm using cocoa I am putting nutrients

338
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,179
in my water every time I am feeding

339
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,489
these plants every time I water because

340
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,099
ko

341
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,870
go does not hang on to the nutrients the

342
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,759
nutrients just fall right out they rinse

343
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,310
right out along with the water so I'm

344
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,580
adding nutrients at every watering in

345
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:37,028
most commercial environments in Colorado

346
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,339
I am not using RO water in fact at this

347
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:43,240
time I am not using reverse osmosis

348
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:45,279
water in any of my situations in any of

349
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,230
my cultivations none of the commercial

350
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,730
grows none of my home grows none of my

351
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,639
friends grows that I'm helping with we

352
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,649
are not using any RO water I think a big

353
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,139
boy filter or something simple like that

354
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,690
is good enough here in Colorado we have

355
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,879
got good water also when you start going

356
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,040
with RO water it makes it a little more

357
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,110
challenging to pH balance everything

358
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,360
it's a little bit more of a struggle if

359
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,850
you are not experienced and I don't find

360
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,860
it necessary here in Colorado we've got

361
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,570
great water they take good care of our

362
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,120
water there's no need to struggle with

363
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,700
the RO there is also a tremendous amount

364
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,759
of waste when it comes to RO so I do not

365
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,940
do that something I do is I frequently

366
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,549
check the pH and the EC of the water

367
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,670
that comes out of my tap in all of my

368
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:33,789
facilities and my home grows your local

369
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:35,919
water company changes the chemicals they

370
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,809
put in their treatment plants based on

371
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,519
this season we're using water for

372
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,169
different things based on the seasons we

373
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,929
are using different amounts of water I

374
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,578
would imagine there are different

375
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:47,169
problems that occur in water that are

376
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,399
happening in different seasons you

377
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,838
probably get different allergies in the

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,519
summer you probably get different [ __ ]

379
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,829
in the winter it's probably different

380
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,929
based on your location so they treat the

381
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:58,299
water differently at different times of

382
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,979
the year it's always a good idea just to

383
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,899
get a little bit of water and put your

384
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,550
pH pin in there put your EC meter in

385
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:05,320
there and just know what's coming out of

386
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,208
your faucet it's always good to know

387
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,870
what you're starting with so mark that

388
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:14,949
down occasionally also always mark down

389
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,740
the pH and the EC or the ppm or the TDS

390
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,800
of any solution you mix to feed your

391
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,629
plants make that a habit when you mix up

392
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,719
your nutrients as soon as you're done

393
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,009
grab your pH meter and grab your ppm pen

394
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,320
and just stick them both in your

395
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,549
nutrient solution watch for it to

396
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,379
register what it is it should be

397
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:33,729
somewhere between six point one and six

398
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,570
point five and then I don't know what's

399
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,889
on your EC meter over here it may be

400
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,080
real high it may be real low just

401
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,929
depends on who you are but write that

402
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,460
[ __ ] down why not maybe later if you've

403
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:45,349
got a problem you can look back and you

404
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,540
can go oh look on Tuesday I fed it way

405
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,759
to high opm's and it didn't like that or

406
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:52,189
when your crop is done and it's awesome

407
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,769
you can say what did we do I want to do

408
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,930
that all over again so I like to write

409
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:59,600
down a lot of information I write down

410
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:01,429
everything I put in the mix I've got a

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,980
Google document for every commercial

412
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:06,229
grow I work with when the guys mix up

413
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,840
something they write exactly what they

414
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,730
put in the mix five mils of this 10 mils

415
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,800
of this 6 mils of this they write it

416
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,830
down they write down the pH they write

417
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,379
down the EC then they water the plants

418
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,970
as the plants get watered we collect a

419
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,340
little bit of the runoff off of each

420
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,870
table so we have another Google document

421
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,330
that says room a table 1 pH runoff EC

422
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,509
runoff and we mark that for each table

423
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,340
for each room so we're documenting every

424
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,590
nutrient that goes into the solution

425
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,509
then we are documenting the pH of that

426
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,759
solution we are also documenting the

427
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,590
PPM's of that solution before we feed it

428
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,919
to the plants then we are also

429
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,990
documenting the pH and ppm of the runoff

430
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,990
that comes out of the pots after we

431
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,389
water now I rarely need to use that data

432
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,909
for anything but when I do need it it is

433
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:57,769
always very obvious where the problem

434
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:00,049
started and what the problem was it

435
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,730
always helps us diagnose a problem even

436
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,979
if it's just through a process of

437
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,319
elimination we can look and see look the

438
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,299
pH coming out is just fine the EC coming

439
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,588
out is just fine so it's not the feed

440
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,730
it's got to be something else in the

441
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:13,129
room let's look and see if we've got

442
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,470
bugs so that is why I document

443
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,320
everything when I feed the plants it

444
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,130
sounds excessive but when you've got

445
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,929
multi-million dollar commercial

446
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,180
facilities at your hands and you've got

447
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,980
multiple guys working guys and gals

448
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,350
working in these places you need

449
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,089
accountability and documentation and

450
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,619
like I said a moment ago if something

451
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,659
goes wrong it's always nice to be able

452
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:35,059
to look back and say this is where we

453
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,860
messed up but it's even better when [ __ ]

454
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:40,279
goes right and you can look back and go

455
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:42,589
do it exactly like this all over again

456
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,629
that way you've got every nutrient

457
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:47,269
you've got every reading you can imagine

458
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,190
just replicate that you can do it all

459
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,379
over and you can have repeat

460
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,730
outcomes everybody gets bonus checks

461
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,500
everybody's happy

462
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,690
alright another detail I should talk

463
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,630
about is in my commercial environments

464
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,750
is everything in Flour is underneath a

465
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,090
thousand watt Gavita double and in light

466
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,859
I like to use the thousand watt double

467
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,659
ended bulbs in a commercial grow I

468
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:10,579
really think that's where I get the best

469
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,440
performance from the plants a lot of

470
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:14,869
people will have different opinions and

471
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,240
ideas I've been doing it a lot I've done

472
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,759
it for a while and my favorite is the

473
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,429
Gavita thousand watt double ended bulb

474
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,140
that works wonderfully for everything

475
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,809
I've tried to put it through for every

476
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,179
plant it performs so that is what I use

477
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:31,548
I also like to have my plants up off the

478
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,830
ground so I use those greenhouse tables

479
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:35,869
I have them custom-built for the length

480
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,699
of the room they are generally six foot

481
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:39,349
wide and the length of the room

482
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,269
they come with trellis bars that you

483
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:43,819
attach to the tables I think the table

484
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:46,548
sections are six or eight feet long in

485
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:48,589
each six or eight foot long section I

486
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:50,750
know exactly how many plants of each

487
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:53,359
strain fit in that section I've got a

488
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,089
very beautiful plan for setting up those

489
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,469
tables so I've got greenhouse tables

490
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:59,720
that are the length of the room there's

491
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,308
six feet wide and they move eighteen

492
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,659
inches left or right so that you can

493
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,980
function in the room you can make an

494
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,900
aisle and then when you're done working

495
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,579
you can push all of the tables all the

496
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,169
way to the right side so that you can

497
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,460
just have one walkway at the left side

498
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,650
of the room and not waste a bunch of

499
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,808
space those are the tables I like to use

500
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,880
and again everything is on a drip feeder

501
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:19,279
or some sort of an auto feeder so you've

502
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,470
got plants on tables there Auto fed it

503
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,389
is really easy it is really efficient to

504
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,919
work in these rooms it's really easy to

505
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,419
get in there and hang up trellis it's

506
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,370
really easy to get in and bottom and

507
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,679
defoliate I've made it really easy for

508
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:33,739
the crew to get work done in these rooms

509
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,890
so now let's focus on a few different

510
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,019
approaches to feeding the plants I keep

511
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,880
talking about my commercial environments

512
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,740
in a commercial grow we were watering

513
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,110
every plant at least once a day

514
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,909
sometimes we are watering plants twice a

515
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,009
day just depending on the performance

516
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,600
and the environment and the pot size and

517
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,119
how much water they go through I

518
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:55,639
understand that everybody is in a

519
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,819
different situation so I'm going to try

520
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,820
to make this work for everybody's grow

521
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,539
also keep in mind that everything I say

522
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,629
were

523
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:08,000
for me none of this is set in stone this

524
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,570
is not a rulebook this is not a Bible

525
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
this is my standard operating procedure

526
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:16,009
you can adjust this to work for you

527
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,589
however you want you can add you can

528
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:20,690
subtract steps you can modify this to

529
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:23,059
work however you would like I'm just

530
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,400
trying to share with you my standard

531
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,669
operating procedure and I encourage you

532
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,650
to adjust this and custom tailor this to

533
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,539
work for your grow and again I'm going

534
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,730
to try to give you examples to where

535
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:37,909
this will work for multiple different

536
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,309
setups in my first example I will tell

537
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,050
you what I do in my commercial

538
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:44,179
environments in a commercial grow

539
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,490
environment where I'm watering every day

540
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,670
sometimes multiple times a day I don't

541
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,829
find it necessary to feed every nutrient

542
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,710
or every bottle or every product to my

543
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:56,779
plants every time I water them I'm going

544
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,210
to get a lot of opportunities to feed

545
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:01,279
these plants so I break up the nutrients

546
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:05,120
throughout the week in a big commercial

547
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,460
grow I will feed base nutrients at every

548
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,429
watering so if I'm using veg blue I will

549
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,410
put in a veg bloom bass mix and every

550
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,289
watering if I'm using new millennium I

551
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,019
will use either autumn gold or summer

552
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:21,200
shift or Equinox or something similar to

553
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:23,720
that at every watering then I will

554
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,269
rotate a series of other products which

555
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,970
I call boosts throughout the week so on

556
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,069
Monday we will add those base nutrients

557
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,470
whether it's the veg blue mix or if it's

558
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,659
the new millennium bass mix I will start

559
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,880
with that but then on Monday maybe I'll

560
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,950
add something like cal-mag and then on

561
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,800
Tuesday maybe we'll add something like

562
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,350
plus life and then on Wednesday maybe

563
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,659
we'll add epsom salts but I will add

564
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,549
different things throughout the week so

565
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,110
the plants get fed all of those

566
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,029
different nutrients or all of those

567
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:55,669
different products but I don't blast

568
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,579
them to the plant all at one time so I

569
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,070
will do a base mix on every watering and

570
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:03,230
then I will write a list of boosts and

571
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,819
they will be I'm just being hypothetical

572
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,710
because I don't have a week or I don't

573
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:07,309
have an idea right now but I'll write on

574
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,940
the board

575
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,129
cal-mag plus life lightning start epsom

576
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,600
salts maybe something like that in a row

577
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,570
there may be three of them there may be

578
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,459
seven of them four

579
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,980
entire week but what we do is we just

580
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,809
rotate through that list so like I said

581
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,460
on Monday you mix up your bass notes

582
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,559
we're gonna use bass nutrients every

583
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,110
time you look at the list you go oh it

584
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,970
says cal-mag so you put however much

585
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,979
cal-mag is required into the mix and

586
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,110
then you just write the date next to it

587
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,059
I put cal-mag in here on Monday the

588
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,099
first and that way we know Monday the

589
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,079
first they got cal-mag Tuesday when we

590
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,939
come in we do the bass nutrients because

591
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,319
we do that every day you just move to

592
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,730
the second one on the list I don't know

593
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,889
what I said I'm gonna guess that it was

594
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,299
probably plus life so we mix in the

595
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,100
appropriate amount of plus life in the

596
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,889
mark on the board on Tuesday the second

597
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,359
I added plus life so on the third or on

598
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,310
the fourth day whatever because by day

599
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,199
four people start getting confused if

600
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:00,000
it's me working if it's another guy

601
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,980
working he just looks at the board and

602
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,960
goes today is the fourth I've got to put

603
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,339
in the fourth product and if he's at the

604
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,930
bottom of the list and we've done them

605
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,699
all you just simply go back to the top

606
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,950
of the list and start all over again and

607
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,410
that makes it very easy to keep those

608
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,269
boost products fed to the plants it's a

609
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,940
very easy way to schedule it and it's a

610
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,920
very easy way to keep my staff on top of

611
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,320
what has been done and what needs to be

612
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,660
done and as a back-up plan we're also

613
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,759
writing all of those nutrients that were

614
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,950
put into the solution in that Google

615
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,809
document so if somebody forgot to update

616
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,160
the board or if you're not sure what was

617
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,480
on the board maybe you can't read some

618
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,610
handwriting or something you've always

619
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,279
got that Google document as a back-up

620
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:41,129
plan so that method we're going to call

621
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,920
that the base nutrients everyday and add

622
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,600
a boost throughout the week method

623
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,160
that's the rotate the boost method I

624
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,289
don't really have a name for it but

625
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,240
that's how we do it I use base nutrients

626
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,039
every day and then we add a booster

627
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,289
throughout the week and I will do this

628
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,629
to my veg plants and my flower plants

629
00:23:55,289 --> 00:24:00,119
that is how I assign nutrient schedules

630
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,490
in a commercial environment another way

631
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,519
to do this is a lot of people like to

632
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,829
mix up a big fat tank of really strong

633
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,329
nutrient mix on Monday feed it

634
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,949
everything what are we gonna feed the

635
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:13,679
plants this week they get it all on

636
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,360
Monday every product every bottle every

637
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,160
nutrient put it all in there

638
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,109
feed the plants all of that on Monday

639
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,880
then throughout the week since we're

640
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:23,099
feeding in cocoa we're just gonna feed

641
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
them base nutrients may be some cal-mag

642
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,309
because they will need it if we're just

643
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,680
feeding them on Mondays

644
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:29,490
that method does work it works for some

645
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,440
people it works

646
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,289
a commercial grow but that is not my

647
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,870
preferred method another way to do it is

648
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,940
to simply fill your reservoir on Monday

649
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:40,589
put everything you need in there and use

650
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,480
that reservoir throughout the week and

651
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:44,519
just keep feeding it that same nutrient

652
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,650
mix all week you have got several

653
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:50,190
options you can do what works for you

654
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:52,140
again the thing that I do is I feed my

655
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,110
base nutrients every day and throughout

656
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,509
the week I rotate different add-ons or

657
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:59,428
different boosts into my mix you may

658
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,470
have to make decisions based on how

659
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,990
often you're available or how often

660
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,819
you're able to mix nutrients can you mix

661
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,950
up your nutrients every single day like

662
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,379
I like to do can you be there every day

663
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,870
to mix those nutrients can you mix a

664
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,490
fresh batch of nutrients every single

665
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:16,619
morning or can you only show up on

666
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,720
Monday can you only show up on Mondays

667
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,058
and Wednesdays those are going to be the

668
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,980
things they determine how you mix and

669
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,440
how often you mix and how you run your

670
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,599
nutrient regimen I am a very hands-on

671
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,580
grower I've got a very hands-on staff

672
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,259
maybe that's a big part of it for me as

673
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:33,178
I know that I've got a staff and I know

674
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,829
there's going to be people there seven

675
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,960
days a week that are going to be able to

676
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:39,089
hand mix these nutrients if I need them

677
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,279
to and make sure that every plant gets

678
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:43,199
the appropriate feeding many people

679
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,940
don't have that luxury many people want

680
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,340
to take a day off many people want to go

681
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,779
on vacation many people have a day job

682
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,000
in a family and they aren't able to

683
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,609
focus and spend that much time on a grow

684
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,890
every single day those are going to be

685
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:58,439
the types of determining factors that

686
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,480
decide how you set up your grow and

687
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,890
you're watering style so you've got a

688
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,420
couple of options do you want to mix

689
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,160
everything on Monday and feed that

690
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,500
throughout the week do you want to do

691
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,509
base nutrients and boosts every day of

692
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,609
the week do you want to feed a big blast

693
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,589
on Monday and then just do nutrients and

694
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,909
Cal mag throughout the week those are

695
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:17,220
things you'll have to think about and

696
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,660
plan ahead are you going on vacation are

697
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,700
you going to have visitors are you gonna

698
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,620
have to take a new job something's gonna

699
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,420
come up so just plan ahead when you were

700
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:27,299
thinking about how you were going to

701
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,700
water and mix your nutrients another

702
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,129
thing I should talk about is clean your

703
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,110
reservoir whatever you are mixing your

704
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,760
nutrients in whatever container or tank

705
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:39,089
you are keeping your nutrient solution

706
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,490
in it is going to get funky drain it

707
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:43,269
occasionally let it get completely dry

708
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,859
clean it you

709
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,049
some sort of a product and clean it

710
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:49,779
really well then once you've cleaned it

711
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,490
really well let it dry then rinse it out

712
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,200
really well to make sure there is no

713
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,150
leftover cleaner in there so we don't

714
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,120
mix that up with our nutrient solution

715
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,200
and cause problems to our plants another

716
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,939
thing I should have mentioned it

717
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,630
previously but it just now dawned on me

718
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,509
is please make sure to calibrate your pH

719
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,400
meters and your ppm meters and any sort

720
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,450
of meter or device you are using that

721
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,910
gives you a reading

722
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,340
please calibrate that stuff at least

723
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,590
once a month I recommend every week if

724
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:19,449
you can take the time all right I feel

725
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,189
like we've got a good foundation we know

726
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,110
what kind of pots to use we know what to

727
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,029
put in the pots we know that we are Auto

728
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,829
feeding these plants we know that these

729
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:28,539
pots are on tables we know there are

730
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:30,759
under a thousand watt lights we've

731
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:32,829
talked about a few different options on

732
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,960
when and how to mix up our nutrients and

733
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:38,049
how to water the plants now I think it

734
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,170
is time to actually get more in depth on

735
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:43,450
the nutrient mix I am going to break

736
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,370
this up into several episodes that maybe

737
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,170
two it maybe three it could end up being

738
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:49,269
four episodes I'm not sure I am in the

739
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:52,210
first episode so I can't tell how long

740
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:54,609
it's going to take yet but the schedule

741
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:58,180
that I am going to give for my nutrients

742
00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:00,250
is a nine week flowering phase so we're

743
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,560
going to focus on a nine week flowering

744
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,500
phase everything I talk about is

745
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,859
probably measured in milliliters per

746
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,019
gallon or grams per gallon some of the

747
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,359
things I use our dry powdered nutrients

748
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:16,089
so I will try to be specific if it

749
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,159
changes I will really try to pay

750
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:21,189
attention and talk about different units

751
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,570
of measure very specifically I said at

752
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,990
the start of the show that this works

753
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:28,539
for me and my gross style and my plants

754
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,000
in my environment you have to pay

755
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:33,039
attention to your plants you have to pay

756
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,069
attention to your leaves I highly

757
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,950
recommend doing runoff reports I will do

758
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:40,869
a full Episode on runoff reports way in

759
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,980
the future that one will be a long ways

760
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:45,099
away I've got a lot of stuff planned

761
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:49,240
before that but you must pay attention

762
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:51,099
to the plants no matter what I say no

763
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,109
matter what you think no matter what

764
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:56,769
your equipment says no matter what your

765
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:57,129
meters say the plants are the boss if

766
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,740
they don't

767
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,870
look happy adjust the plants are not

768
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,960
going to adjust to the meters you have

769
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,219
to adjust everything to the plants pay

770
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,980
attention to them

771
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,750
the plants are always the boss you're

772
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,150
not the boss the owner of the facility

773
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,250
is not the boss the investors are not

774
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,800
the boss the consumers are not the boss

775
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,930
all of those plants in that grow room

776
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,089
those are your bosses it's like you've

777
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,039
got a whole roomful of girlfriends and

778
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:24,609
you've got to learn to make all of them

779
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,289
happy

780
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,000
all right you guys I just realized I've

781
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,720
been talking for like 30 minutes I could

782
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
use a drink

783
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,650
I really need a DAB I'm going to press

784
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,259
pause for a moment and when I get back I

785
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,480
will tell you how I mix up my clone

786
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:40,599
solution and we will get this mix

787
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,829
episode really moving take a DAB with me

788
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:45,069
and I'll be right back

789
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:47,439
all right podcast world I am back I'm

790
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:49,990
heavily medicated during my break I took

791
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,539
a bunch of fat dabs of cowboy Kush full

792
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,660
spectrum extract this is a blend of h a

793
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:58,599
OG and star dawg the flavor is described

794
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,060
as earthy fuel and leather I really

795
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,009
enjoy that funky earthy feely flavor I'm

796
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,619
not sure I got leather out of it what I

797
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,210
did get was a punch to the face this one

798
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,169
kind of makes me lazy makes me want to

799
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,420
sit down and chill out

800
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,440
it also makes me nice and focused so

801
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,289
this should be good

802
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,269
Podcast concentrates let's jump right

803
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,849
back into it before I took my dad break

804
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:22,720
I said I was going to tell you how I mix

805
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:24,609
my solution for my cloners in a

806
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,220
commercial environment I run easy

807
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,289
cloners I run turbo cloners I run all of

808
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,529
the automated Aero cloners you can think

809
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:35,920
of I also run the traditional tray and

810
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:38,769
dome type clone setup in all of those

811
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,890
environments I use that basic purple

812
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:45,279
clone X dipping solution and the yellow

813
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:47,740
clone X cloning solution if I am using

814
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,660
the tray and clone plug and dome

815
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,789
technique to make my clones

816
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,730
I will generally buy a bunch of rapid

817
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:57,730
Rooter clone plugs then I will soak

818
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,160
those rapid rooters in a solution it is

819
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,349
just water and the yellow clone X

820
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,120
cloning solution not the purple dippin

821
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:06,689
stuff but the yellow solution in the

822
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:11,189
taller bottle I will mix that to

823
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:14,100
approximately a 1.0 to one point

824
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:17,549
- II see and I will adjust the pH of

825
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:20,579
that solution to five point seven - six

826
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:22,169
point two then I put those rapid rooters

827
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,829
in the little trays and there are little

828
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,930
slots

829
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:27,389
I cut the clones I dip them into the

830
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:30,180
purple clonic solution and put them

831
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,270
gently into the clone plug then I place

832
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,759
a dome over those clones I close the

833
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:38,160
vents and I put it under a t5 light with

834
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,589
that light fairly close and I do not

835
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,350
touch those clones for approximately

836
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:45,269
three to five days I basically ignore

837
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:47,219
them until it looks like they need some

838
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:49,559
water when they need water

839
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,839
I will re moisten them again with that

840
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,369
same solution not the same bucket I

841
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,369
won't have that same solution laying

842
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:59,639
around I will remix a fresh batch of the

843
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:02,369
same solution it is water and that clone

844
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,890
X yellow solution I'll mix it up in an

845
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:07,829
EC of one point zero to one point two

846
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,200
and again I will adjust the pH to five

847
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:12,480
point seven to six point two and I will

848
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,309
saturate those clone plugs I'll let it

849
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,769
sit open for a minute while those plugs

850
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,139
are saturated then before I close it I

851
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,879
will dump off all of the water that is

852
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,980
ran out of those plugs that is in the

853
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,840
tray that way they're not sitting in too

854
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,970
much stagnant water but the clone plugs

855
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,009
are nice and saturated I'll put the dome

856
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,140
back on there and probably leave them

857
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:33,629
alone for a day or two before I begin

858
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,640
cracking those vents slowly and start

859
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,490
introducing more airflow to those clones

860
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,730
but that is basically the feed the mix

861
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:44,700
that I use for my clones in a clone tray

862
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,940
I do a very similar thing to my clones

863
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,160
in an easy cloner or a turbo cloner one

864
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,400
of the most important things is to clean

865
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,980
everything on the turbo cloner or the EZ

866
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,040
cloner make sure it is sanitary and

867
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,860
sterilized I like to sanitize the cloner

868
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,019
and the clone plugs every time I use it

869
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:07,559
so start off with a clean machine and

870
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:10,019
set yourself up for success then fill

871
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,690
your reservoir on your clone machine to

872
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:16,559
the appropriate level and add the yellow

873
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:20,519
clone X solution until you reach an EC

874
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,259
of 1.0 - 1.2 this is really easy to do

875
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,629
you've got your water in the reservoir

876
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,809
to the level you want it

877
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,390
ICI meter in there and add a very small

878
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:32,429
amount of the clonic solution now stir

879
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,990
that around with your meter make sure

880
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,840
you're stirring it all around get that

881
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,539
solution all in that water now what does

882
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,509
your EC meter say does it say point six

883
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:44,460
does it say one point zero if it says

884
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:47,940
point six you obviously need to add a

885
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,390
little bit more go very slowly when you

886
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,390
were adding your nutrient solution but

887
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,180
slowly add until you reach that EC of

888
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,160
one point zero to one point two and if

889
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,440
you go a little bit too high you can

890
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,180
just add more water and dilute it this

891
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,549
may take a couple of tries to get it

892
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,440
right try to pay attention to how much

893
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:10,230
of the solution you added to the water

894
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,139
to achieve that one point zero to one

895
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,690
point two EC and maybe right down I used

896
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,250
30 mils and it got me really close and

897
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,780
then I had to start using a dropper to

898
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,150
get it dialed in where I wanted it or

899
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,430
maybe you need 50 mils I don't know how

900
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:25,559
big your reservoir is so I don't know

901
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,899
how much to tell you to use I can tell

902
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,489
you to get it to one point zero to one

903
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,079
point two and it's fun

904
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,149
learning how to dial that in you add

905
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,860
solution you measure it you say I'm too

906
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,809
high or too low you either add more

907
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,820
solution or you don't then it's way too

908
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:40,139
high now you have to add water you end

909
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,730
up putting in more solution you just

910
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,400
keep playing that game until you get it

911
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,670
right once you've got the appropriate EC

912
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,519
that is when you adjust the pH do not

913
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,519
adjust the pH until after you have

914
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,230
achieved the appropriate EC if you are

915
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,300
going to add more water or more

916
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,010
nutrients there is no need to correct

917
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,230
the pH at this time you're going to have

918
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:03,090
to do it again so you've got your

919
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,099
reservoir it is filled appropriately

920
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,950
it's got the right solution in it it is

921
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:11,130
at the right pH then I cut my clones I

922
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:13,739
dip them into that purple clone x gel I

923
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,420
put them in the clone collar I put them

924
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,039
to where they stick about I think that's

925
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,389
about an inch maybe a little more maybe

926
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,369
a little bit less than an inch is

927
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:22,619
exposed on the bottom side of the clone

928
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,719
collar so the water being misted hits

929
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,630
the bottom of that clone and makes big

930
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,179
fat roots any part that is going to be

931
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,390
under the clone collar I try to code it

932
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:35,730
in the clone x solution I've done a very

933
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:37,500
in-depth episode on cutting clones in an

934
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,630
easy corner so we don't need to talk too

935
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,349
much about that he

936
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:45,140
but the next day you will find that all

937
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,539
of that purple gel has fallen off of

938
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:50,058
your clones and it is now in your water

939
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:53,239
in your reservoir in your cloner I

940
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:55,160
suggest that you unplug the cloner take

941
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,629
the top portion off of the cloner this

942
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,548
is where all the clones are take that

943
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,380
off and just set it on the table if you

944
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:01,940
set it down on a level table you won't

945
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,140
damage the clones they're not sticking

946
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,269
out far enough to cause any problems

947
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:06,828
just set that down somewhere where you

948
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:08,838
don't mess up the bottoms of the clones

949
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:10,280
those will be safe for a few minutes

950
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,308
without getting sprayed on the bottom

951
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,880
use your meters to measure your pH and

952
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:19,220
your EC all of that purple Clone x gel

953
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,338
solution dripping off of your clones has

954
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:25,368
changed the pH and the EC of the water

955
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:28,099
in that reservoir also that sprayer

956
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:30,500
spraying overnight has changed the pH

957
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,880
and the EC of the water in that

958
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,679
reservoir you've had some evaporation

959
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,720
you've had some mix time you've

960
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,389
introduced more oxygen things have

961
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:40,159
changed over the past 12 or 24 hours and

962
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:42,650
we need to correct them so that our

963
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,469
clones will survive so open up the

964
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,210
cloner use your meters investigate find

965
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:50,659
out the numbers and adjust accordingly

966
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,970
if the pH went too high make it lower if

967
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:55,789
the pH went too low make it higher if

968
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:58,338
the EC is too low make it higher if the

969
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,048
EC has gotten too high add more water

970
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:01,250
because some water may have sprayed out

971
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:03,230
of the cloner some water may have

972
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,329
evaporated I don't know what could have

973
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,309
happened overnight in your cloner there

974
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:09,230
are countless opportunities and

975
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,780
possibilities when it comes to working

976
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,760
with easy cloners so while we've got the

977
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,950
cloner open this is a good time to add

978
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,650
another product I like to add something

979
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:22,699
called clear res I like to add clear res

980
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,619
today and every 5 days that means we

981
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,419
need to mark it down whatever the date

982
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,440
is today when you're adding the clear

983
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,838
res right

984
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,230
I put clear res in here on Tuesday the

985
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,900
first then on the 6th you need to add 30

986
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,940
more milliliters of clear res and if

987
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,789
that cloner is going again in 5 more

988
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,470
days add 30 more mils and it probably

989
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,808
shouldn't be going for another round of

990
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,858
clear res but if it is make sure you add

991
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:49,460
it and write it down

992
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:51,799
every time this may sound crazy but even

993
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,199
if you run the grow by yourself right

994
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,600
beings down like somebody else is going

995
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:58,219
to come and help you out act like there

996
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,650
is another person that needs that

997
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,839
information because we are cannabis

998
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,119
consumers we have a lot on our mind the

999
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,610
world is overwhelming take a lot of

1000
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,829
notes help yourself out set yourself up

1001
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,690
for success just leave yourself a little

1002
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,150
note a little hint a little path a

1003
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:16,280
little treasure map give yourself a clue

1004
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:19,130
take as many detailed notes as you can

1005
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,710
so make sure you mark down when you were

1006
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,930
putting clear res in the reservoir so

1007
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,909
that you know that it does get done at

1008
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:28,250
this point you have basically got your

1009
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:30,440
easy cloner on autopilot all you have to

1010
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,960
do is open it up every morning and check

1011
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,150
the EC and check the pH and if those are

1012
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,380
correct you can leave it alone if one of

1013
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,720
those needs to be adjusted

1014
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,640
adjust accordingly if the EC has gone

1015
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,699
too high because water has evaporated

1016
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:46,190
add water after you add water check the

1017
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:49,309
pH again it will need to be adjusted if

1018
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:52,579
the EC has gone too low add more

1019
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:54,500
nutrient solution after that correct the

1020
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:56,480
pH again you're always going to be

1021
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,360
checking and adjusting the pH in these

1022
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,030
easy cloners it is very important but it

1023
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,620
will make strong fathealthy clones I

1024
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,900
think the clones that come from these

1025
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:07,849
easy cloners I personally think they

1026
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,470
take off a little more quickly and

1027
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:11,599
they're a little more healthy than the

1028
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:12,980
clones that come from the clone plugs I

1029
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,889
think they just have a little more

1030
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,619
Kabang to them so that is my basic feed

1031
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:21,739
for my clones I am basically mixing up

1032
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:24,409
that yellow clone X clone solution at an

1033
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:27,139
EC of one point zero to one point two

1034
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:29,389
and then I am adjusting my pH to five

1035
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:31,789
point seven to six point two and I am

1036
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:33,799
doing that if I'm using rapid Rooter or

1037
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:35,630
whatever type of clone plugs even if

1038
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,150
it's a rock wool plug I'll do the same

1039
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,950
mix and if I'm using a turbo cloner or

1040
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:43,220
an EZ cloner or some type of an arrow

1041
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:45,049
cloner I use the exact same mix I just

1042
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:47,149
have more maintenance and more things to

1043
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,710
do throughout the week there is one more

1044
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,530
detail I should mention when it comes to

1045
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,990
cloning I do personally like perma clone

1046
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,210
clone callers yes that is a blatant

1047
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:58,279
advertisement for a product but I like

1048
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,170
them because they don't get moldy and

1049
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,360
they don't get funky and they don't fall

1050
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,190
apart and you can sanitize them and

1051
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,670
reuse them

1052
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,530
reusable clone

1053
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,568
dollars are worth every penny in my

1054
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,000
opinion that's less stuff to throw away

1055
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:14,068
that's less stuff to buy again and we

1056
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,548
can just sanitize it and keep using it

1057
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:19,409
so I recommend perma clone clone callers

1058
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:23,519
now let's work our way into talking

1059
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:25,529
about the small veg mix once my plants

1060
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,318
come from the cloner I put them into a

1061
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:32,339
four inch or a six inch net pot this is

1062
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:34,650
where I like to use 70% cocoa and 30

1063
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:37,440
percent perlite these plants are going

1064
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,349
to be in these four to six inch net pots

1065
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,150
for approximately two to four weeks it

1066
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:44,640
just depends on the strain and how these

1067
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:47,010
plants perform but be prepared for them

1068
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,980
to be in these pots for approximately

1069
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,540
two to four weeks some of your faster

1070
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,940
growing strains they'll be ready for an

1071
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,009
up pot in approximately two weeks some

1072
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,079
of your oh geez and your slower growing

1073
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:01,410
pushes we'll leave them in these tighter

1074
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,480
pots for closer to four weeks now let's

1075
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:06,149
talk about what we are going to feed our

1076
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,219
a small veg plants I consider these

1077
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,380
small veg until I transplant them into

1078
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:13,139
their three gallon pots then they will

1079
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:16,619
become large veg so this is what I feed

1080
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:19,469
my small veg plants I've got two options

1081
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:22,108
for base nutrients in some of my

1082
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:24,959
facilities I am running veg bloom

1083
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:27,869
powdered nutrients I'm sure you have

1084
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,030
seen the veg Plus bloom logo at your

1085
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:33,269
local grocer or somewhere online I

1086
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:35,460
really enjoy I really am satisfied with

1087
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:38,989
the outcome and the quality of my

1088
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:42,000
product when I use veg bloom base

1089
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:44,129
nutrients veg bloom offers several

1090
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,798
different types of base nutrients

1091
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:49,349
depending on the type of water you have

1092
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:51,659
in your location they offer an ro based

1093
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,660
nutrient which is for reverse osmosis

1094
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,879
water they offer a dirty which is for

1095
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,798
places with what they consider dirty

1096
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,588
water they offer another product called

1097
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:04,259
hard which is for places with what we

1098
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:06,630
would consider hard water they recommend

1099
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,250
a water test you check your water you

1100
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,710
look on their website and they will make

1101
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,619
the appropriate recommendation of base

1102
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,838
nutrient for your grow in most cases

1103
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,780
you're probably going to want the dirty

1104
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,578
or the HD unless you're running RO water

1105
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,940
then you

1106
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:25,789
obviously want ro so in many cases I am

1107
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,249
running veg bloom based nutrients but

1108
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,430
also in many facilities I do like to use

1109
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:33,858
new millennium nutrients new millennium

1110
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:35,598
makes a great line of nutrients I really

1111
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:37,458
like the way the plants perform and I

1112
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,009
really like the way they have broken

1113
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:42,618
down the bottles and the way to feed the

1114
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:45,889
plants so I will give you a couple of

1115
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:48,798
different options of how I feed my small

1116
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:51,108
veg plants most of the time my veg

1117
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:52,969
plants are hand water they are not in an

1118
00:42:51,108 --> 00:42:54,858
auto watering system until they get into

1119
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:57,559
their three gallon pots so these are

1120
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:59,449
being watered by a pitcher or something

1121
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,609
similar to that they're getting watered

1122
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:03,949
by a person who is paying attention to

1123
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:05,538
every plant my nutrient solution is

1124
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:07,939
usually mixed into a large reservoir

1125
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:10,339
we've usually got 30 or 50 gallon

1126
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,528
reservoirs for the bedrooms and this is

1127
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:16,518
what I am mixing into my nutrient

1128
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:20,509
reservoirs I usually start with 5 grams

1129
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:23,538
of veg bloom powdered base nutrients per

1130
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:25,608
gallon of water ok if I am using veg

1131
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:29,449
bloom I'll repeat that if I am using veg

1132
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:32,298
bloom I use 5 grams of powdered base

1133
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:35,930
nutrients per gallon of water if I'm

1134
00:43:32,298 --> 00:43:38,268
using veg bloom if I am not using veg

1135
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:40,879
bloom I will use and pay attention

1136
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:44,268
because I don't use these at the same

1137
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,160
time I either use veg bloom or new

1138
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:50,419
millennium if I use the new millennium

1139
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:54,368
in my small veg I will use 3 milliliters

1140
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:57,979
per gallon of equinox and nine

1141
00:43:54,369 --> 00:44:00,588
milliliters per gallon of summer shift

1142
00:43:57,978 --> 00:44:02,509
ok so we've got 2 different options here

1143
00:44:00,588 --> 00:44:06,380
you've got the veg bloom or the new

1144
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:08,809
millennium base then I will add this to

1145
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:12,680
whichever base I have chosen to use I

1146
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:16,359
will use 5 milliliters per gallon of

1147
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:19,068
water of Ruby and I will also use 1

1148
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:21,588
milliliter per gallon of water of

1149
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:24,228
lightening start so we are either using

1150
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:27,048
that veg bloom base mix or we are using

1151
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:29,989
the new millennium base mix don't use

1152
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:32,958
both bases you will burn the plants then

1153
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:33,619
to that base mix every day I am adding

1154
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:36,498
by

1155
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:38,960
milliliters of Ruby and one milliliter

1156
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:41,088
of lightning start and I want this to be

1157
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,400
very clear that you do not use both of

1158
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:46,909
those bases because you will ruin your

1159
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,389
plants so one example for the base would

1160
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:53,088
be three milliliters of equinox and nine

1161
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:55,969
milliliters of summer shipped along with

1162
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:58,009
five milliliters of Ruby and one

1163
00:44:55,969 --> 00:45:01,879
milliliter of lightning start that is

1164
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:05,690
one base set up the other base set up

1165
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:09,680
option is five grams of veg bloom based

1166
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,588
nutrients plus five milliliters of Ruby

1167
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,748
plus one milliliter of lightning start

1168
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,670
those are your options don't do both of

1169
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:19,159
them please I hope I made that very

1170
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:21,048
clear now we are going to feed one of

1171
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:23,808
those as a base mix if you were doing

1172
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:25,699
the daily blast they get that every day

1173
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:28,369
if you're doing the Monday mix they get

1174
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:31,278
that every Monday now these are the

1175
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:35,150
things that I would add to that mix as a

1176
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:39,139
boost on a daily rotation I would start

1177
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:41,690
off with plus life the day I transplant

1178
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:44,838
those plants I would like to mix a half

1179
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,480
gram per gallon of water of plus life

1180
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,358
into my nutrient solution and feed it to

1181
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,119
the plants on day one of transplant to

1182
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:54,798
get that mycorrhizal fungus and get

1183
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,200
those beneficial bacteria

1184
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:59,389
started in my plants just get them nice

1185
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,328
and healthy get those roots going so I

1186
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:05,298
start with a half a gram of plus life

1187
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:09,920
that is my first boost my second boost

1188
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:12,440
is cal-mag I cannot recommend how much

1189
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,159
cal-mag you feed your small plants

1190
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,798
because I do not know which brand of

1191
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,778
cal-mag you have purchased I don't want

1192
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:24,199
to make a recommendation and ruin your

1193
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:26,449
plants on your bottle of cal-mag it will

1194
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:29,808
recommend how much to feed your plants

1195
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:33,348
based on their size when your plants are

1196
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:36,230
little I recommend you use half of what

1197
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:38,298
that bottle recommends they're going to

1198
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,599
suggest a little bit more so that you

1199
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:43,730
use more so that you have to buy more I

1200
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,309
think you can get away with half of that

1201
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,480
bottles recommended cal-mag while your

1202
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:50,000
plants are

1203
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,639
so on day one we're going to boost with

1204
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,119
plus life on day two we're going to

1205
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:59,750
boost with cal-mag on day three I want

1206
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:03,019
to use five milliliters of lightening

1207
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:05,239
star per gallon of water so if you're

1208
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:08,179
mixing up a ten gallon rez you're going

1209
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:11,319
to put 50 milliliters of lightning start

1210
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:13,730
into that reservoir so we've got five

1211
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:17,780
milliliters of lightning start is our

1212
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:22,159
third boost then on day four I would

1213
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:25,490
like to use one gram of epsom salts per

1214
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:28,429
gallon of water as my boost on day four

1215
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:31,519
so we are using our base nutrient mix

1216
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:34,339
every single day then throughout the

1217
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,230
week we are rotating our boosts we are

1218
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,150
starting with plus life then we're

1219
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,070
moving to kalmyk then we're doing a

1220
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,490
lightning start and then on day four we

1221
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:46,309
are adding epsom salts on day five I do

1222
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:48,618
not add a boost I will skip that day

1223
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:50,900
then on day six we're going to go right

1224
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:54,170
back around and start with that plus

1225
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,840
life again and repeat the cycle and I

1226
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:58,960
will repeat that cycle on my small veg

1227
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,280
plants until the day they are

1228
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,260
transplanted into their three gallon

1229
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,130
pots and they begin receiving their

1230
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:09,530
large veg feed now for your small veg

1231
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,230
mix feeding and Coco with a nice

1232
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:15,590
pearlite mix I do recommend you adjust

1233
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:19,159
the pH of your solution to six point one

1234
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:23,030
to six point four before watering your

1235
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:24,858
plants so that is the small vegetative

1236
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,990
mix and we're going to feed that again

1237
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:29,299
until we transplant them into the three

1238
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:31,279
gallon pots now I know I've said this a

1239
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,580
lot I know I repeated this a whole bunch

1240
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,920
but do not double up on those bases that

1241
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:40,579
I talked about either use a new

1242
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:43,400
millennium base or use a veg bloom base

1243
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:46,699
either one will work wonderfully and it

1244
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,130
is up to you it is okay to use a veg

1245
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:51,439
bloom base and new millennium additives

1246
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,809
it is okay to use a certain brand and

1247
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,490
add another brand if you understand what

1248
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,739
you were doing I've got a pretty good

1249
00:48:55,489 --> 00:49:00,229
map here and I will get us to our goal I

1250
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,009
understand what I'm doing as long as you

1251
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,440
don't double up

1252
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:06,380
on those basis this will be a beautiful

1253
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,990
mix just please don't double up on that

1254
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,730
bass mix that will fry your plants you

1255
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,679
will have a terrible experience and then

1256
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,260
you'll send me an angry email and I'll

1257
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:18,019
have to tell you bro I said don't double

1258
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:20,210
up on the bass so just a quick recap on

1259
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:22,969
that and we will move into the large veg

1260
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:26,389
mix you've got the options of a veg

1261
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:30,049
bloom bass or a new millennium base that

1262
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:32,690
veg bloom base is simply 5 grams of your

1263
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:36,530
base mix per gallon of water that's

1264
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:39,889
either ro dirty hard HD whichever one

1265
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:43,430
you select 5 grams per gallon of water

1266
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:46,099
is your veg bloom base mix to that you

1267
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:49,009
will add five millilitres of Ruby and

1268
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:51,739
you will also add one milliliter of

1269
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:55,490
lightening start your other option if

1270
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:59,959
you go with the new millennium base mix

1271
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:03,229
is three milliliters of equinox and nine

1272
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,230
milliliters of summer shift to that you

1273
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,090
will also add the 5 mils of Ruby and 1

1274
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,519
mil of lightning start those are your

1275
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:12,740
two options for a base then I'll recap

1276
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:16,400
quickly our booths we want to use plus

1277
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:19,339
life cal-mag lightning start epsom salts

1278
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,730
then skip a day and always adjust that

1279
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,559
to six point one to six point four all

1280
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,260
right that's a quick recap on the small

1281
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:31,009
veg mix that means it is time to work

1282
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:33,830
our way into the large vegetative feed

1283
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:36,140
mix this is when we move our plants into

1284
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:39,619
three gallon fabric pots this is where

1285
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:42,500
we use that 70% cocoa 20 percent perlite

1286
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:44,359
and 15 percent personal light mix we're

1287
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,630
going to keep these plants in these

1288
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,970
three gallon pots until harvest time in

1289
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:52,220
my facilities they live to the end of

1290
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:53,719
their life in a three gallon pot they're

1291
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,579
going to veg in these pots for

1292
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:57,379
approximately three to four weeks then

1293
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:59,449
they will flower in these pots for

1294
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,130
approximately eight to ten weeks in this

1295
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:04,669
lesson we're going to focus on nine

1296
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:08,390
weeks but let's talk about the veg mix

1297
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:12,980
for my large veg plants again you've got

1298
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:14,690
the options of a veg bloom base mix or a

1299
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,170
new millennium base

1300
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:23,450
mix the veg bloom bass mix is very

1301
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:27,920
simple it is 5 grams of veg bloom bass

1302
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:31,129
nutrient powder per gallon of water make

1303
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,170
sure you carefully weigh 5 grams per

1304
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,760
gallon of water so if you've got a 10

1305
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:39,200
gallon reservoir you're going to want to

1306
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,780
put 50 grams of veg bloom base mix into

1307
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,818
that water so you start with the 5 grams

1308
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,880
of veg bloom then you're going to add to

1309
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:50,119
that 5 milliliters per gallon of water

1310
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,150
of Ruby we are always going to use Ruby

1311
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,280
Ruby is fulvic acid fulvic acid makes

1312
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,930
your nutrients more available to your

1313
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,390
plant that is the simple way to put it

1314
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:01,279
it is like adding an octane booster to

1315
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:02,838
your gas tank we are paying a lot of

1316
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,089
money for all of these expensive

1317
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:07,460
nutrients by adding a little bit of Ruby

1318
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:09,739
you unlock more potential so your plants

1319
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,449
can absorb more of those nutrients it's

1320
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:14,649
a little bit of a turbocharged or an

1321
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:17,838
octane booster so let's always add 5

1322
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,000
milliliters of Ruby per gallon of water

1323
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,309
just about every time we're mixing up

1324
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,550
nutrients so let's stay focused we are

1325
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:27,588
working on the veg bloom base mix for

1326
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,900
large bed plants we have started with 5

1327
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:33,259
grams of veg bloom base powder we have

1328
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:36,650
added 5 milliliters of Ruby let's also

1329
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,810
add one milliliter of lightening start

1330
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,818
from new millennium so that is one of

1331
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:42,858
your base nutrient options if you're

1332
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:46,369
going with the veg bloom you've got 5

1333
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:49,400
grams of veg bloom powder 5 milliliters

1334
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:52,849
of Ruby and one milliliter of lightening

1335
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:56,329
start here is another option again don't

1336
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:58,460
mix this with the veg bloom you'll kill

1337
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:00,650
your plants and you'll be mad at me here

1338
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:05,440
is your other option if you want to use

1339
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:10,608
a new millennium base mix I recommend 4

1340
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:14,809
milliliters of Equinox 2 millilitres of

1341
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:18,920
autumn gold and 10 milliliters of summer

1342
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:22,130
shift per gallon of water so that's for

1343
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:24,530
equinox - autumn gold and 10 summer

1344
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:28,099
shift then to that we are going to add

1345
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,229
that standard 5 milliliters of room

1346
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:32,719
we want that fulvic acid in there then

1347
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:35,208
we're also going to add one milliliter

1348
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:38,778
of lightning start lightning start is to

1349
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:40,879
help develop roots healthy roots make

1350
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:42,650
fast growing plants so we're always

1351
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,930
going to add the Ruby and the lightning

1352
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,660
start to our veg mixes just to give them

1353
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:51,889
a little turbo charge so those are your

1354
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:55,190
two options for large veg base mixes

1355
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:57,469
then we are going to work in our boosts

1356
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,900
again if you want to mix all of this up

1357
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:01,940
on Monday you can do this as a Monday

1358
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,009
mix if you want to do this as a boost

1359
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,440
throughout the week this is how I would

1360
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:09,139
suggest it I like to start the week off

1361
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,019
with that plus life so on day one we

1362
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:15,379
were going to add a half a gram of plus

1363
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:18,649
life per gallon of water 1/2 of a gram

1364
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,108
per gallon then on day 2 we're going to

1365
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,239
go with cal-mag again I can't make a

1366
00:54:21,108 --> 00:54:25,068
recommendation on how much cal-mag you

1367
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:27,259
add to your plants because I don't know

1368
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:30,170
which brand of cal-mag you have

1369
00:54:27,259 --> 00:54:33,619
purchased if you have got the g-h brand

1370
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:36,739
of Kali magic you can probably use 1 to

1371
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:39,588
2 milliliters per gallon and your plants

1372
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:42,708
will be happy then the next day I would

1373
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:45,048
recommend we use 5 milliliters of

1374
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:46,608
lightning start add that to the one

1375
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,920
milliliter that you're already using

1376
00:54:46,608 --> 00:54:51,199
because this is a separate boost we are

1377
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,420
adding this to give a little more root

1378
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:56,420
development and make the plants go a

1379
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,969
little faster then our next boost is

1380
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:02,539
going to be epsom salts one gram of

1381
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:06,048
epsom salts per gallon of water on day

1382
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:08,329
four then on day 5 we are not going to

1383
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:10,608
add a boost then we are going to go

1384
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:13,369
right back to the start with our half

1385
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:15,858
gram of plus life and repeat the list so

1386
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:18,680
again it is plus life cal-mag

1387
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:21,108
lightning start Epsom salt and just

1388
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:24,498
repeat that cycle and tell these plants

1389
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:26,478
go into flour now for my large bed mix I

1390
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:28,968
will recommend that we do adjust the pH

1391
00:55:26,478 --> 00:55:31,458
to somewhere between six point one and

1392
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:33,829
six point four and of course make sure

1393
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:36,139
you are getting plenty of runoff when

1394
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:38,298
you were watering these plants alright I

1395
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:40,670
feel like we're making great progress on

1396
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:41,989
the mix episode here we have talked

1397
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,340
about what to feed our clone

1398
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:45,319
we have talked about what to feed our

1399
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,940
small veg I feel like we've got a solid

1400
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,340
idea of what to feed our large Badge

1401
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,980
plants I've got one more thing I feel

1402
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,079
like I should make sure to cover at this

1403
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,480
stage of the game it is really important

1404
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,389
to have a solid integrated pest

1405
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,760
management strategy in place we need to

1406
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,650
make sure not to get bugs it is almost

1407
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,540
time to put our plants into flour I

1408
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,880
really don't like putting plants into

1409
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:09,889
flour if there is a pest problem I'll do

1410
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,930
my best to eradicate that problem before

1411
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:14,179
we go into bloom because once you were

1412
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:16,730
in bloom you are very limited on your

1413
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:19,039
options for getting rid of bugs so make

1414
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:21,920
sure you are working on some sort of

1415
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,809
integrated pest management strategy

1416
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,570
multiple modes of attack multiple

1417
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:28,340
methods pay good attention have a lot of

1418
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,380
indicators in there that is a whole

1419
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:33,200
another episode what I wanted to make

1420
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:37,309
sure to add into that part was when I

1421
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:41,269
apply a sprayed on pesticide I always

1422
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:43,670
mix in a product called push pushes from

1423
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:46,070
veg bloom they do recommend that you

1424
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,380
don't mix push with other products but

1425
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:51,590
if I am applying a pesticide I always

1426
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:54,260
add the recommended dosage of push to

1427
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,640
that pesticide it is a foliar feed I

1428
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,710
feel like if I'm gonna put something

1429
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:59,809
shitty on the plants they may compromise

1430
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,789
their health that I can offset some of

1431
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:04,250
that damage by adding something healthy

1432
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:07,250
and I think that good healthy product is

1433
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:09,469
push so every time I apply a pesticide I

1434
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:11,179
mix a little bit of push in the mix and

1435
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:14,480
spray that onto the plants as

1436
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:16,969
recommended I also like to use push once

1437
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,159
a week with or without a pesticide if

1438
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:21,349
I'm not applying a pesticide I will mix

1439
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:24,108
up the recommended dosage of push I do

1440
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:26,210
believe it's 50 milliliters per gallon

1441
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,710
shake the [ __ ] out of it and apply that

1442
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:30,710
to the plants when the lights are off

1443
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:34,070
and I feel like I can see the growth

1444
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:35,960
that comes from using push so pushes and

1445
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:38,420
other products I like to use throughout

1446
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,699
the entire veg phase right up to the

1447
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,280
time I start seeing bud sites develop

1448
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:46,250
pushes a great product and I think I can

1449
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,830
actually see the results from using it

1450
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,679
so something you can add is push about

1451
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:54,650
once a week at 50 mils per gallon

1452
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,368
applied as a foliar feed and also add it
