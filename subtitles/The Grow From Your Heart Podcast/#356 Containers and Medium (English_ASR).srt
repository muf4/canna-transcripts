12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
I am dabbing I just took a big fat dab

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,320
of some coffee

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,079
nectar from our friends at Green Dot

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,480
labs this is alien cush and alien OG

16
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,640
it's described as dark roast coffee and

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,289
watermelon candy I've talked about this

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,480
one on the show before it absolutely

19
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,308
does have that coffee flavor then the

20
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,558
lingering aftertaste is a little bit of

21
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,869
coffee with that sweet watermelon flavor

22
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,159
that is an accurate description there so

23
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,140
big shout out to our friends at green

24
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,349
dot Labs and excellent work on the

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,058
coffee nectar this episode is going to

26
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,129
be another grow less and this will be

27
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,929
the fifth lesson in a long series of

28
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,899
grow lessons I've got planned for you

29
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:03,090
this lesson will be more about selecting

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,890
our equipment so at this point in the

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,750
grow lessons we should have a good goal

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,879
for our grow we should have a good place

33
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,469
for our grow planned out we should have

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,420
a good idea of the equipment that we

35
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,728
need and also you should have a good

36
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,500
idea of how to set up all of that gear

37
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,408
now that we've got a good grow room

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,239
running let's talk about pots and soil

39
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,670
and then we'll work our way into our

40
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,289
nutrient options when it comes to

41
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,930
selecting containers for our plants

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,780
we've got a lot of options we can select

43
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,880
net pots we can select plastic nursery

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,368
pots we can use fabric pots

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,069
also there are waffle pots also known as

46
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:40,530
root pots available I've seen people get

47
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,688
various sizes of bags of soil and cut

48
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,759
the top off a bag of soil you compact

49
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,529
that soil down into the bag really tight

50
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,959
and you can grow your plant directly in

51
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,849
there if that's what you want to do all

52
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,728
of these methods have their pros and

53
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,489
cons the main thing to focus on when

54
00:01:53,728 --> 00:02:00,030
selecting your pots is drainage your

55
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:01,408
pots need holes on the bottom we're

56
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,450
going to be watering and feeding our

57
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,219
plants a lot of water if there's nowhere

58
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,719
for that excess water to go it's just

59
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,939
gonna build up in your pot you're gonna

60
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,038
create a mud puddle your plant will

61
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,090
drown the roots will drown in there your

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,769
plant will die

63
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,659
we need plenty of holes

64
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,240
for drainage in the bottom of our pot no

65
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,159
matter what type of pot we select the

66
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,590
net pots I talked about those are mostly

67
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,049
holes your nursery pots they should come

68
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,270
with holes already in them the fabric

69
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,340
pots they provide plenty of drainage by

70
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,780
being a fabric pot the waffle pot does

71
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,610
the same thing and you guys won't have

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,650
seen a waffle pot I mean those air pots

73
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,510
it looks like a waffle maker with a

74
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,520
bunch of holes in it and sometimes it's

75
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,649
got rivets that you can undo and you can

76
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,840
unroll the pot and take the root ball

77
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,180
out and you can manipulate the root ball

78
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,740
and then put the pot back on or you can

79
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,270
up pot it at that time but that's what I

80
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,850
mean when I'm saying the waffle pots

81
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,800
they're air pots it looks like somebody

82
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,569
rolled them out with a waffle maker and

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,890
they made a pot out of it you'll see

84
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,180
those when you go to the gross store and

85
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,309
you go shopping for pots you'll know

86
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,170
what I'm talking about you can use

87
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,390
whatever container you've got available

88
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,459
to you a lot of people like to go buy a

89
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,199
bunch of five-gallon buckets a lot of

90
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,120
people like to recycle some sort of

91
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,609
container that they use frequently that

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,370
is fine as long as you make some

93
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,840
drainage holes quite often I start my

94
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,659
baby plants whether they're seeds or

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,520
clones in beer cups when football season

96
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,490
starts or during the Superbowl those

97
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,650
beer cups go on sale super cheap stock

98
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,020
up get yourself a few bags of beer cups

99
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,090
then I stack them up about eight or ten

100
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,100
tall and I use a drill and I take a

101
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,569
power drill with the long bit and I poke

102
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,109
a hole right through the bottom of the

103
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,489
center of eight to ten cups at a time I

104
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,350
just did 20 cups and they've got holes

105
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,180
in them they've got one big drainage

106
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,590
hole now I'll also go through and make

107
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,390
one or two more holes on the side of

108
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,340
each cup after that so I've got three

109
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,959
solid drainage holes and a beer cup that

110
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,520
has plenty of drainage you're not gonna

111
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,439
get any root rot you're not gonna get

112
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,750
stagnant water in the bottom there so

113
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,669
that's a great way to segue what are we

114
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,610
going to segue into let's work our way

115
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,500
into pot size we've got plenty of

116
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,230
drainage now we need a pot that is the

117
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,300
appropriate size for our plant I talked

118
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,759
about beer cups I like to start small

119
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,070
plants in small pots either a beer cup

120
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,409
maybe a four maybe a six inch net pot

121
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,329
the reason for that why do you want to

122
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,850
put a little tiny plant with a little

123
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,410
tiny root zone in a big pot let's say

124
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,450
you put it in a three gallon pot you've

125
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,010
got all that extra space in there for

126
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,899
those roots to just swim around in

127
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,060
that's extra space that you need to

128
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,699
water that's going to require more water

129
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,079
will require more nutrients also you're

130
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,579
going to have to spread the plants out

131
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,069
more if they're in larger pots which

132
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,599
means you may require more light by

133
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,370
keeping them in smaller pots

134
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,930
it keeps the garden more efficient and

135
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,389
keeps things more cost effective and

136
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,310
it's easier to maintain so I start my

137
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,530
babies off in a little tiny pot and when

138
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,079
it's time I transplant them into a one

139
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:51,359
or three gallon pot sometimes I'll

140
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,550
finish my plants in that one or three

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,230
gallon pot other times I will either

142
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,319
skip the three gallon and go straight

143
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,290
into a 7 gallon pot or I'll go from the

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,719
cup into a 3 gallon into a 7 gallon pot

145
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,629
now let's talk about deciding which size

146
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,940
pot to use how do I know which size pot

147
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,668
to transplant into that all depends on

148
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,560
how long that plant is going to live it

149
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:15,599
all depends on how big that plant is

150
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,060
going to be in the end of its life cycle

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,550
how long are you going to veg how long

152
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,800
are you going to flower the pot size

153
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,660
will also play a huge factor into how

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,939
frequently you need to water your garden

155
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,650
if you're running little one gallon pots

156
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,660
and you've got semi large plants you're

157
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,279
gonna have to water every day if you've

158
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,290
got semi large plants but you're running

159
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,389
seven or ten gallon pots you can go in

160
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,520
dump a bunch of water in there you can

161
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,319
leave those four to three sometimes four

162
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,538
or five days depending on how far into

163
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,370
your cycles you are so the pot size is

164
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,439
going to make a huge difference on how

165
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,329
frequently you water now let's talk

166
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,788
about the size of the plant and the size

167
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,579
of our container when growing vigorous

168
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:55,469
cannabis plants I would suggest

169
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:58,978
approximately a two to three gallon pot

170
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,510
for every 12 inches of plant growth so

171
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,300
if you've got a twelve inch tall plant

172
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,560
you want about a two or three gallon pot

173
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,210
and I'm talking about your finished

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,819
plant size so if your plants gonna

175
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,288
finish about twelve maybe 18 inches tall

176
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,788
that's when you want a two or three

177
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:14,189
gallon pot sometimes I'll get them about

178
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,959
24 inches tall and that three gallon pot

179
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,850
but that's really pushing it then I'm

180
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,609
watering every single day and they're

181
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,260
thirsty at the start of every day so if

182
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,620
your plants are gonna finish around 12

183
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,110
18 maybe 24 inches at the maximum height

184
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,180
then you can go in a 2 to 3 gallon pot

185
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,430
if you want to grow bigger plants you

186
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,259
need bigger pots if you want to go to

187
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,720
like a two foot tall plant that's when I

188
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,879
would definitely recommend three to five

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,889
gallon pots I like a five gallon pot a

190
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,418
five gallon pot is very versatile

191
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,819
now if we want bigger plants we

192
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,519
obviously need to move into bigger pots

193
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,080
if you want about a 36 inch to a 42 inch

194
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,908
plant maybe just a little bit bigger

195
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,949
that's when you need to work with the

196
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:54,688
five to seven gallon pots now once you

197
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,490
start going past five feet in an indoor

198
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,870
grow it starts kind of becoming a pain

199
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,028
in the ass unless you're in a commercial

200
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,860
grow with kavita's up on the ceiling

201
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:03,870
you've got all that ceiling height but a

202
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,400
five or six foot tall plant is really as

203
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,019
tall as I would recommend in an indoor

204
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,028
grow unless you're really pushing it if

205
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,498
you're gonna push out a big six foot

206
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,300
monster in the garage or something

207
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:14,789
that's when you want to push into a ten

208
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,800
maybe a 12 gallon pot we just need to be

209
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:18,568
sure to have enough root space to

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,788
support these giant plants we're trying

211
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,129
to grow so try to select the appropriate

212
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:25,168
container for the appropriate plant size

213
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,819
you're going to work with also keep in

214
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,459
mind that you can start small and you

215
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,439
can always up pot that plant I don't

216
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,120
recommend up potting during flower if

217
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,699
it's critical you can do that I would

218
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,278
like to see transplant probably ten days

219
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,620
maybe 710 days maybe five days before

220
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:41,968
you put it into flower but you can if

221
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,860
you're good at it you're not gonna shock

222
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:45,838
the plant at all you can transplant it

223
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,250
the day you flip into flower and you can

224
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,478
put it in a flower that day as long as

225
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,069
you don't disrupt anything as long as

226
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,758
you don't piss that plant off you will

227
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,680
be okay

228
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,419
if you've given it any shock if you're

229
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,218
not experienced with transplanting I

230
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,718
would certainly give it a few days to

231
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,370
recover that way it's not getting

232
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:00,930
transplanted and triggered into flower

233
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,930
and trying to figure life out all at the

234
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,189
same time give that plant a chance so

235
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,468
we've talked about drainage we have

236
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,180
talked about the height and size of a

237
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:12,300
plant in a pot now let's talk about the

238
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,538
pros and the cons of small pots versus

239
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,389
large pots small pots let's talk about

240
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:20,158
the advantage of using small containers

241
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,560
in our garden with a smaller container

242
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,930
you don't need as much water which means

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,939
you don't need as much nutrient the

244
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,158
downside to that is you may need to

245
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,870
water more frequently once the plants

246
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,028
get a little larger you may be in there

247
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,000
watering twice a day if your pots are

248
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,519
too small for your plant size another

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,528
advantage of small pots is that you can

250
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,448
fit the plants closer together they

251
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:44,578
don't take up as much space the

252
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,379
downfalls of that is you don't have as

253
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:48,299
much space for branching if you're

254
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,980
running a strain that just does one

255
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,109
stick straight up and doesn't have a lot

256
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,699
of side branching maybe smaller pots are

257
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,720
ideal because you can get them closer

258
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,899
together

259
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,850
another advantage to smaller pots are

260
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,500
mobility some people aren't able-bodied

261
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,750
some people need some assistance and

262
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,090
large pots may not be ideal for them

263
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,490
these small pots may be the way to go

264
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,190
for people who aren't physically able to

265
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,169
manage a five or seven gallon pot once

266
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,000
these plants once these pots are filled

267
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:16,589
with medium if we're gonna put cocoa if

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,179
we're gonna put soil we're gonna put a

269
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,310
soilless mix or whatever we put in there

270
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,469
then you add a plant in there then you

271
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,759
add a gallon of water to a five-gallon

272
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,200
pot that's got quite a bit of weight to

273
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,240
it if you're not an able-bodied person

274
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,160
or if you've got anything slowing you

275
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,799
down that pot may not move it may be

276
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,019
stuck right there so one of the

277
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,689
advantages of smaller pots is mobility

278
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,029
now let's talk about larger pots as we

279
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,250
work our way into larger pots we do have

280
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:44,370
different advantages and disadvantages

281
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,159
one advantage of larger pots is less

282
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,710
frequent watering the disadvantage to

283
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,480
that is it takes more to water at one

284
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,700
time let's see we've got a seven gallon

285
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,769
pot and the plants in about week three a

286
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,480
flower and we've given that plant a

287
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,069
chance to dry out a little bit and it's

288
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,009
actually thirsty and it's prime time for

289
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,680
water that plant may take at least a

290
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,480
gallon maybe a gallon and a half

291
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,729
possibly two full gallons of water so

292
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,190
it's gonna take a lot more water to

293
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,500
water that larger pot but we're not

294
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,620
going to need to water it for probably

295
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,659
three days now my favorite advantage to

296
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,269
running large seven gallon pots is

297
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:23,789
bigger plants in a bigger pot you can

298
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,439
get a bigger plant there are a lot of

299
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,480
things to consider when thinking about

300
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,030
pot size the main thing to think about

301
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,100
is how big will your plant be in the end

302
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,500
you need a big enough home for your

303
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,330
plant at its finished size now something

304
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,509
to help you kind of think about pot size

305
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,730
is plant count in Colorado we are

306
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,069
strictly limited by the amount of plants

307
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,379
we grow it doesn't matter how big those

308
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,050
plants are but the number is what they

309
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,820
go by so somewhere like Colorado with a

310
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:53,609
limited plant count that's where we

311
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,960
start growing gigantic plants instead of

312
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,360
having a whole bunch of little plants

313
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,280
under one light we just put one plant

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,169
under a light and veg it for a long time

315
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,240
and then flower that out and we try to

316
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:06,120
get one to two pounds out of one plant

317
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,460
under one light so plant count is a huge

318
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,528
factor to keep in mind when thinking of

319
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,379
pot size now if you don't have a plant

320
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:16,230
count your options are limitless you can

321
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,689
run little 4 inch by 4 inch rock wool

322
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,909
cubes you can put 64 of those on a 4 by

323
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,370
4 tray and you can absolutely pull

324
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,860
easily a pound underneath one light with

325
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,959
64 little plants and very little veg

326
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,209
time or if you want bigger plants you

327
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,278
can do 9 3 gallon pots under a thousand

328
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,479
watt light or if you want to go bigger

329
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,028
that's when I would start recommending

330
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,009
like 4 7 gallon pots under a thousand or

331
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,588
if you want to go even bigger maybe do

332
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:43,200
one or two 10 gallons or maybe just one

333
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,660
12 gallon pot underneath a thousand watt

334
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,190
light those are some of the pros and

335
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,399
cons or the advantages and disadvantages

336
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,080
of larger and smaller pots I talked

337
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,700
about different types of pots let's go

338
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,879
over some of the types of pots that are

339
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,890
available I talked about net pots net

340
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,750
pots are usually available in four or

341
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:02,338
six inch diameters they aren't very deep

342
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,589
they're only about three or four inches

343
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,050
deep they look like somebody took a pot

344
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,180
and then just cut a bunch of holes out

345
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,039
of it to make it more like a mesh more

346
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,739
like a spaghetti strainer that is a net

347
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,990
pot the advantage to that is it gets a

348
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,820
lot of airflow so you don't ever over

349
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,339
water the plants and you get plenty of

350
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,129
wet and dry cycling and you get a lot of

351
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,170
oxygen to your root zone the downfall

352
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,458
with the net pots is being so small and

353
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,769
allowing all that airflow they do

354
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,689
require frequent watering once the

355
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,708
plants start building a good root system

356
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,600
in there

357
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,819
the next pots I talked about were our

358
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,980
basic nursery pots they're the plastic

359
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,450
pots we are all familiar with they come

360
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,430
in a lot of different sizes they're

361
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,920
usually round some of them are square

362
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,778
they are available in black or white if

363
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,610
you're growing outdoors I may recommend

364
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,740
a white pot if it's available and the

365
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,959
size you're looking for indoors I don't

366
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,909
think it makes a difference those pots

367
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,979
are great there's a reason why they are

368
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,078
the industry standard they come in any

369
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,629
size and volume you need and they are

370
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,208
also very affordable so those are your

371
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,100
basic nursery pots the advantage to

372
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:07,528
those is they don't dry out as quickly

373
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,629
as a root pot or an air pot so you'll

374
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:12,570
have more time between waterings the

375
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:14,338
disadvantage is less root growth and

376
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,950
slower root growth because that

377
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,930
restricted air flow more air flow allows

378
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,850
more root growth it also allows the

379
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,409
plants to dry more quickly so there's a

380
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,840
balance there between plastic

381
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:27,659
pots and fabric pots that's a great way

382
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,940
to segue into fabric pots fabric pots

383
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,740
are available in many sizes I've seen

384
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,780
them as small as a half gallon and I've

385
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,240
seen them as big as 200 gallons and

386
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,149
everything in between let's talk about

387
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,149
the advantages of the fabric pots there

388
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,220
is a lot of air flow to your root zone I

389
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,279
talked about it earlier the roots love

390
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,860
airflow this also helps us prevent

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,659
over-watering even if you do over water

392
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,490
that pots not going to hold it because

393
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,529
it is fabric that water will just run

394
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,720
right off so that's really advantageous

395
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,539
with the large pot something I should

396
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,639
mention here's the disadvantage your air

397
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,099
pots your fabric pots are going to dry

398
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,720
out much more quickly than a plastic pot

399
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,000
because of all that airflow

400
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,100
I would suggest buying a little larger

401
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,500
pot if you're going to run fabric pots

402
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,920
if you want to run 5 gallon plastic pots

403
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,450
consider 7 gallon fabric pots for that

404
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,490
extra time so that you don't have to

405
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,290
water and your roots are just gonna grow

406
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,419
more quickly with those air pots so I

407
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,939
would recommend that extra space just to

408
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,579
be safe so the advantage to fabric pots

409
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,320
is faster growing more productive roots

410
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,780
the disadvantage is you're going to have

411
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,879
to water more frequently now let's talk

412
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,889
about those air pots or the waffle pots

413
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,960
I talked about what are those things all

414
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,819
about those are great for the same

415
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,150
reason as the fabric pots because your

416
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,980
roots get oxygen from all directions

417
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,379
another great thing about them is they

418
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,659
have got rivets on them when it's time

419
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,820
to up pot your pot you don't have to

420
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,549
lift that root ball up out of that pot

421
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,680
you can undo the rivets and that pot

422
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,539
unwraps off of your root ball then you

423
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,969
can gently pick that root ball up and

424
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:05,129
set it into your up pot container and

425
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,080
once your plant is up potted all you

426
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,389
have to do is pop the rivets back in and

427
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,070
you can reuse that pot so it is reusable

428
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,509
you didn't have to destroy it to get the

429
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,980
plant out of there and the plant didn't

430
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:16,009
have to get destroyed to get out of

431
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,259
there so that's the advantage to those

432
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:22,289
the disadvantage is the same as the

433
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,870
fabric pots they require more frequent

434
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:26,610
watering so that's a basic breakdown of

435
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,169
the three most common types of pots

436
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,810
you're going to run into when shopping

437
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:32,909
for pots for your new grow no matter

438
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,669
what type of pot you select you're going

439
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,328
to need something under that to collect

440
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,979
the runoff

441
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:40,378
water keep in mind you'll need some sort

442
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,178
of saucer or a tray underneath your pot

443
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,249
or maybe you're gonna put all of your

444
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:46,048
pots on a table just think about when

445
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:48,178
you water it's all gonna run off you

446
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:49,678
need to collect that water somehow it's

447
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:51,448
got to go somewhere even if you're

448
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:53,399
running it all off into a table it's all

449
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:54,958
got to get to a drain somehow if you're

450
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,578
just running it into saucers you may

451
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,289
need to get a shop vac and suck that

452
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:00,748
water out of there don't leave those

453
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:03,269
plants sitting in stagnant water for too

454
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:05,730
long all right that basically covers the

455
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,249
pots and the part that goes on the floor

456
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,048
I've been talking for about 16 minutes I

457
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,548
throw it's getting a little dry my heads

458
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:13,318
getting a little clearer I'm gonna press

459
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:15,269
pause I'm gonna take a couple of dabs

460
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,610
I'm gonna get a drink and then when we

461
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,759
get back we will talk about selecting

462
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,230
our medium for our new grow while I'm

463
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,480
taking a couple of dabs I'm going to

464
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,539
drop in a quick promotion for my patreon

465

campaign this podcast is free I do this

466
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,678
podcast because I love cannabis and

467
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,778

00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,259
grow so you can provide that for

470
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,868
yourself and people that rely on you

471
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,389
there are a few costs involved in

producing and hosting a podcast if you

473
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,318
would like to help offset those costs

our new grow medium that is what's going

489
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,318
to go inside of our pot that is what our

490
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,870
plant is going to grow out of are you

491
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,638
going to choose soil a soilless mix are

492
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,199
you going to grow in cocoa or are you

493
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:33,119
gonna cook up a batch of super soil

494
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,460
maybe you want some living soil maybe

495
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,859
you want to do a TLO or a no-till sort

496
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,169
of system or maybe you're just going to

497
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,788
grow in rock wool cubes and I know I

498
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,799
don't have a lot of information in this

499
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:46,500
episode for our hydro friends but I will

500
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:49,470
put together an entire hydro segment in

501
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,990
the future for our waterborne friends

502
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,839
but for now let's talk about soil and

503
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,788
soilless mixes a lot of people will tell

504
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,829
you that they are growing in soil when

505
00:17:56,788 --> 00:18:01,109
actually they are growing in a soilless

506
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:03,509
mix let's talk about the main

507
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:06,990
differences between soil and a soilless

508
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:10,619
mix a soilless mix is right between a

509
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,710
soil and a hydro grow soilless mix looks

510
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:17,389
just like soil or dirt the difference is

511
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:20,429
there are no nutrients in a soilless mix

512
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,490
soilless mixes are basically peat or

513
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,710
cocoa based most of your soilless mixes

514
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,279
will have plenty of aeration added to

515
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,509
them like perlite or volcanic rock

516
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,369
soilless mixes are great because they

517
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,589
give us complete control over what we

518
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,750
are feeding our plants now that leads us

519
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:39,389
right into soil the main difference

520
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,298
between a soilless blend and soil is the

521
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,038
soil will have nutrients

522
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:46,139
most of our store-bought soil mixes will

523
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,849
have the same things as a soilless mix

524
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,009
it will have the perlite it will have

525
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,288
the peat moss in there but it will also

526
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:55,169
contain organically decomposed matter

527
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:57,839
that make the soil rich in micro and

528
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,280
macro nutrients now the advantage to

529
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,678
that is that you don't need to feed your

530
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,200
plants as heavily if at all the

531
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,730
disadvantage is you don't need to feed

532
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,860
your plants so you don't have control

533
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,500
over what you're feeding your plants are

534
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:13,129
already nutrients in that medium and you

535
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,569
may not know exactly what's there also

536
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,400
eventually those nutrients will be eaten

537
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:19,678
up and you will need to either re amend

538
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,240
that soil or start using bottled

539
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,298
nutrients so that's the main difference

540
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,548
between soil and a soilless mix most of

541
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:29,279
us are going to go with a soilless mix

542
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:32,220
most of the soil and soilless mix is

543
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,649
available at your local grocer for you

544
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,329
to grow in I really try not to recommend

545
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,559
specific products and specific brands

546
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,798
but I want to make this easy for

547
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,658
everybody Fox farms ocean forest soil is

548
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,339
available everywhere and it will work

549
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,690
for you some people are gonna hate me

550
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:48,269
for that some people are gonna love me

551
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,490
for that it works it is fine if that's

552
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,480
what's available to you get that it will

553
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,269
do a good job

554
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,190
also roots organics makes a quality soil

555
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,019
again I'm gonna get lovers and haters

556
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,750
for that I'm trying to make this easy

557
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,849
for new growers if you want a big bale

558
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,538
of soil it's going to work very well for

559
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,668
you

560
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:07,470
sunshine makes number four is very

561
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,379
cost-effective and it is a quality

562
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,179
product for a new grower I really try to

563
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:14,248
stay away from specific products but

564
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,929
those will work for a new grower and I

565
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:18,778
know they are available at most

566
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:21,778
reputable grow shops if you choose to

567
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:24,989
grow in a soil eventually you may need

568
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:27,749
to re amend that soil or start watering

569
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,970
with bottled nutrients if you go with

570
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,819
the soilless mix you do need to start

571
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,868
feeding nutrients right away that's when

572
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,778
we'll need to start thinking about

573
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:39,058
organics or synthetics or boxes or

574
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:43,409
bottles now that gives us a beautiful

575
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:45,028
segue into pre-made soil mixes a lot of

576
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,259
people don't want to use bottled

577
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,788
nutrients they want to be more

578
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,548
sustainable and they want to be more

579
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,528
organic the best options to do that are

580
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:56,489
things like super soil or other living

581
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:58,470
soils or TLO or a no-till setup when

582
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:00,090
you're using these pre-made soils you

583
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,679
don't need to add bottled nutrients

584
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,388
because everything is already in the

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,759
medium available to the plant as the

586
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:07,829
plant needs it now let's talk briefly

587
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,868
about what I mean by super soil or a

588
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:11,460
living soil they're very similar some

589
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,019
people are gonna argue with me but we're

590
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,298
gonna put them in the same category for

591
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:18,239
the sake of this talk a super soil or a

592
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:20,668
living soil is exactly that it is a soil

593
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:22,739
that is alive it is filled with microbes

594
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,989
and beneficial fungus and bacteria and

595
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,429
all of the macro and micronutrients we

596
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:28,528
need to get our plant through the growth

597
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,778
cycle and a lot of times people add a

598
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:33,089
few bonus items in there like some

599
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:35,759
volcanic rock dust or whatever your

600
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,388
secret ingredient may be but a super

601
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,798
soil

602
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:39,388
you basically gather all of your

603
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,069
ingredients in the way I would do it I

604
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:43,678
would throw a large tarp on the ground

605
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:45,239
in the garage I would mix up all of the

606
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,639
ingredients together there's gonna be

607
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,499
bags of a base mix which will probably

608
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:51,598
be a soilless mix that you'll probably

609
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:54,058
get from a gross store and then a lot of

610
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:55,739
amendments depending on your style of

611
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:57,628
growing and what you want to do the

612
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,579
amendments will vary if you've heard

613
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:01,108
Sean and Jessi on the show before you

614
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,329
know we're probably going to put some

615
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:05,579
alfalfa in there we'll probably put some

616
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,678
karanji in there probably be some neem

617
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:09,569
cakes in there it all just depends on

618
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,788
the style of your grow if you want to

619
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,618
use animal products you can put blood

620
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:16,019
meal bone meal and fish meal in there

621
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:17,199
you can always put oyster shell stuff in

622
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,329
there you can put kelp meal

623
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,058
they're all that type of stuff we'll go

624
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,558
into a living soil or a super soil then

625
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:25,569
it will get mixed up and put into a

626
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,369
container then a little water will be

627
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:28,808
added that will make everything come to

628
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,668
life in there you'll start seeing a

629
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:33,009
little white fungus on top of your soil

630
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:35,528
that is a good thing that is why we call

631
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:38,470
it living soil that's a living soil or a

632
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:40,480
super soil idea you can find plenty of

633
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,970
recipes online if you google sub-cooled

634
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,759
super soil recipe you will find it I

635
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,380
promise you can also go to build a soils

636
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,359
website and I'm sure they will give you

637
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,639
plenty of information on building a

638
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,089
living soil now let me talk briefly

639
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:57,819
about the pros and cons of a living soil

640
00:22:55,089 --> 00:23:00,369
or a super soil first it's a lot of

641
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:02,500
ingredients to gather but they are

642
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,418
affordable there are probably more cost

643
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,250
effective than buying a bunch of bottles

644
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,470
so you gather your ingredients then

645
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,089
you've got to mix them yourself which is

646
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,620
kind of fun if you're into that if

647
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,869
you're not into that it's a giant pain

648
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:16,089
in the ass I think it's fun you lay out

649
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,069
a giant tarp in the garage you weigh out

650
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,509
and measure out your stuff you mix it up

651
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:21,819
you put it in containers it's a good

652
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:24,609
time so there's work to it then it's got

653
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:26,288
to cook it needs a specified time

654
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:30,189
depending on your ingredients it needs

655
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:32,440
about 30 maybe 45 days so it needs prep

656
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,149
time that is the downfall another

657
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,460
downfall is a lot of those organic

658
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:38,678
amendments are not completely reliable

659
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,808
on their nitrogen potassium and

660
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,669
phosphorous levels we're adding a bunch

661
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:44,528
of things to a bunch of other things and

662
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:46,210
cooking it it may come out a little

663
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:48,609
richer or a little lighter than we

664
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,769
expected if you're not an experienced

665
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:52,959
grower a super soil may throw your

666
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:55,359
plants off and you will have no idea how

667
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,159
to adjust and correct that so that is

668
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,379
one of the major downfalls to a living

669
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,970
soil for a new grower if you mix

670
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,799
everything properly and you know how to

671
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,079
pay attention to the plants a living

672
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,359
soil and a super soil can do beautiful

673
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,500
things for your garden now if you really

674
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,138
want to step your game up

675
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,089
you can go TLO which means true living

676
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:15,459
organics or you can go no-till they're

677
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:17,528
both very similar I honestly don't have

678
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,360
a lot of experience in either one that's

679
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:20,950
Sean and Jessie's Department they both

680
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,778
crush it with the TLO and with the

681
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,880
living organic stuff but that's when you

682
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:26,919
start involving worms into your grow

683
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,440
that's when so with the no-till garden

684
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,030
we're never taking anything to the trash

685
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,400
we're basically harvesting

686
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,319
and then we're the whole from that plant

687
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,700
was we put another plant and then back

688
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,099
fill it with a little bit of compost

689
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,380
that we've made ourselves the waste from

690
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:44,019
the plant after we harvest it goes back

691
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,880
into our compost so we reuse almost

692
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:48,039
everything in a no-till environment

693
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,080
again with a TLO and a no-till

694
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,930
environment it does take some time to

695
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,210
prepare and set up that soil one good

696
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,920
thing about a no-till all of my no-till

697
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,259
friends tell me it gets better with

698
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,390
every grow they bought everything for

699
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:03,250
the no-till grow they set it up one time

700
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,410
and they got it going and they got it

701
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,450
dialed in and they grew a crop and those

702
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,130
plants came out pretty well they pulled

703
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,970
out that root ball they put that in the

704
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,200
compost bin

705
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,089
they put a fresh plant in there they

706
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,740
added some compost they remanded they

707
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:16,659
put some cover crop on the plant or on

708
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,980
the pot and then it grew in there the

709
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,110
whole plant grew again they said that

710
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,789
second crop was better the last time

711
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:24,250
frosty was here I think he said he was

712
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:25,629
on his seventh run with his no-till crop

713
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,970
and it is getting better every time

714
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,490
imagine if every time you grew in the

715
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,400
dirt it got better a normal soil or

716
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,990
soilless mix guy is either throwing that

717
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,210
away or trying to find some way to

718
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,059
recycle it and it's a struggle so the

719
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,250
advantage there of the no-till is you

720
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,139
were recycling all of your grow to go

721
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,869
back into your grow it is very

722
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,900
sustainable and it is 100% organic if

723
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:52,329
you keep it that way the downfall is it

724
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,190
takes a lot of time to set up and it's a

725
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:56,470
hundred percent organic so if you have a

726
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,840
problem you have to research a hundred

727
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,210
percent organic methods to correct your

728
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,549
issues you can't go to the store buy a

729
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,079
bottle of something shake it up apply it

730
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,419
to your plants and think you've solved

731
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,579
your problem it's not so easy in a

732
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,380
no-till environment it looks like it

733
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:13,419
takes a little more thinking but it also

734
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,920
looks like it is much more rewarding my

735
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,250
friends that grow the no-till weed it

736
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,130
really tastes really good so the pros of

737
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,839
the no-till and the TLO grow is it's

738
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,220
organic you know what you're putting in

739
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,579
there you know that you're gonna have a

740
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,319
clean tasty product also it's being self

741
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,879
sustained you don't have to introduce a

742
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,109
bunch of funky [ __ ] you don't have to

743
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,200
keep buying products there are no

744
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,939
bottles to throw away the downside is it

745
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,830
takes a little while to get your medium

746
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,080
started before you can even put a plant

747
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:43,629
in there you guys I honestly don't have

748
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,869
enough experience with a super soil a

749
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,030
living soil at

750
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:49,159
yellow or a no-till grow to talk like

751
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm an expert I'm trying to give you the

752
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,308
best of my knowledge from what I

753
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,230
understand I'm sure there is more to

754
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:55,970
think about when it comes to those types

755
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,099
of grows those are more advanced

756
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,049
techniques in my opinion now we've

757
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:01,939
talked about soil and soilless mixes

758
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:04,220
we've talked about living soils let's

759
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,430
talk about the exact opposite let's talk

760
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,220
about cocoa I really like growing in

761
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,690
cocoa I have a lot of experience growing

762
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,819
in cocoa if I were to set up a

763
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,200
commercial grow today and I had a budget

764
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:17,539
that I could do whatever I wanted with

765
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,259
we would run a cocoa setup it would be

766
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:23,420
cocoa with a lot of perlite I like cocoa

767
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:26,269
because cocoa doesn't hold on to any

768
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,029
nutrients I also like cocoa because it

769
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:30,529
is inert it does not contain any

770
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,509
nutrients when you buy it it is just

771
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:35,029
clean medium that the plants can hang

772
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,529
out in and the roots really seem to be

773
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,269
comfortable in there so you get to

774
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,099
control everything when it comes to

775
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:42,019
cocoa you get to control every nutrient

776
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,359
that goes in there and I really like the

777
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:46,490
wet and dry time with cocoa a well

778
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,279
aerated cocoa wet and dry time is

779
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,440
beautiful and one thing about cocoa it

780
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,960
kind of works like hydro so I'm able to

781
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,700
feed my cocoa grow twice a day I can

782
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,860
pump nutrients through that grow two

783
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,470
times every day which means those plants

784
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,599
are really eating heavily a couple of

785
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,730
tips if you choose cocoa make sure you

786
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,250
rinse your cocoa before you put your

787
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,990
plants in it wash it off it is dirty I'm

788
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,819
not sure where you got your cocoa from

789
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,799
who knows where they got it from who

790
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,539
knows where it was stored just rinse it

791
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,678
if you can just fill a pot with it if

792
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,569
that's what you need to do put it in a

793
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,679
giant pot and then just run a bunch of

794
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:20,899
water through it to where you're running

795
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,150
the water clean that would really be

796
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,759
beneficial for you also when you're

797
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,070
running cocoa you may need more Cal mag

798
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,200
than you're used to earlier I said

799
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,700
nothing stays in the cocoa that means

800
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,440
that the cal-mag just falls right out

801
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,240
when you've got runoff water that

802
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
cal-mag went right on out with that it's

803
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,750
not hanging out in the medium like it

804
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,490
would if you had soil there's nothing

805
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,558
for it to hang on to in the cocoa the

806
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,660
cocoa doesn't grab it like a soil or

807
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,490
soilless mix wood so a couple of basic

808
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,230
tips if you choose to go in cocoa would

809
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,240
be make sure you rinse it it may be

810
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,000
salty you don't want to put your plants

811
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,429
in that salty environment then increase

812
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,470
your Cal mag and possibly you may need

813
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,310
to increase your overall nutrient

814
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,350
regimen

815
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:02,119
recommend feeding everyday when you're

816
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:04,069
growing in cocoa if you're in soil or a

817
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,529
soilless mix you may be only feeding

818
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:09,769
once a week or twice a week you can feed

819
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:12,170
every single day in cocoa every time you

820
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:14,359
water those plants put some nutrients in

821
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,890
there if you're growing in cocoa a lot

822
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,049
of times in the big grow we would give

823
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,280
them a big watering a big feeding to

824
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:21,139
start the day they would get base

825
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,059
nutrients they would get cal-mag they'd

826
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,620
get a bloom booster they would get their

827
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,879
whatever else we were feeding them that

828
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:27,500
day we had a whole list of stuff we

829
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,330
would feed the plants so we'd feed them

830
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,190
that early in the morning then right

831
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:33,470
before we leave a lot of times we would

832
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,600
just shoot just a small feed of just

833
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,769
base nutrients in cal-mag through at the

834
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,269
end of the day just to make sure the

835
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:40,009
plants were wet by the time we got there

836
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:42,019
in the morning and they really liked

837
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:44,119
being fed twice a day that first time we

838
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:47,150
would feed him a big fat meal the second

839
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,099
time just base notes and cal-mag so the

840
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,710
benefits are growing in cocoa is you get

841
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,059
to control all of the nutrients in the

842
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,759
middle I don't know if it's a pro or con

843
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,619
it dries up more quickly than soil so

844
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,359
you may need to water more often I like

845
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:02,119
that because that means I get to feed

846
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,729
more frequently now the con to growing

847
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,859
in cocoa it's not as forgiving as soil

848
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,289
or a soilless mix it's acting more like

849
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:11,240
hydro so if you make a mistake you're

850
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:13,579
going to see it immediately

851
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,710
there's no buffer to fix your mistakes

852
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,809
so if you over feed in cocoa those

853
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,509
plants will show you right away now

854
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:22,399
let's move into the last medium that I

855
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:25,430
have on my list to talk about and that

856
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,140
is rock wool rock wool are those cubes

857
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,269
that you see at the gross store they

858
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,340
just look like a giant sponge they're

859
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,470
great for hydro they are great for a

860
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:35,720
commercial environment they are very

861
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,630
cost effective they are very easy to

862
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,930
dispose of they work very much like

863
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:45,080
cocoa they do not have any nutrients in

864
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:48,110
them they do not hold any nutrients they

865
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:51,319
also have a very nice wet and dry time

866
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:53,299
they come in a very large variety of

867
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,399
sizes you can get them in a one by one

868
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,529
cube so you can cut your clone into a

869
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,350
little one by one then they also make

870
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:02,180
them in a four by four a six by six just

871
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:04,609
about any size you need and you can grow

872
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,039
a huge plant in a small rockwool cube

873
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,169
you can cut your clone into a one-inch

874
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,940
Rockwell cube and then the 4x4 has a

875
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,450
little spot where that one inch will set

876
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,950
right in

877
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,319
to it and then the eight-inch has a

878
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,179
little slot cut into it or that 4x4 fits

879
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,678
right into it so you can just keep up

880
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:21,230
potting just by setting it on top of

881
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,899
another one that really saves a lot of

882
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,579
work in a large commercial grow and I

883
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:28,398
probably shouldn't forget that they also

884
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:30,259
offer cocoa in the same types of slabs

885
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,298
you put your clone into a small little

886
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,158
cocoa slab and then it fits right into a

887
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:35,808
larger which fits into a larger cocoa

888
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,669
slab it kind of looks like a volcano I

889
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:40,000
should not forget about that

890
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:42,559
those are great for hydro type

891
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,089
applications all right you guys I feel

892
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,558
like that is enough podcasting for one

893
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:47,388
episode we talked about selecting

894
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:49,730
containers we talked about selecting

895
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:52,668
your medium in the next episode we will

896
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:55,038
talk about selecting nutrients for your

897
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,750
new grow do you want to go organic do

898
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,210
you want to go synthetic we will talk

899
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,589
about it in depth on the next episode I

900
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,690
want to thank you guys again for

901
