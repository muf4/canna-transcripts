47
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,089
of my favorites I did a lot of searching

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,580
to get something kind of unique in my

49
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,979
garden and this is the one that actually

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,750
stuck around and I was the culmination

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,250
of my year of hard work great

52

work can end up in a mason jar something

57
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,900

you can do so by visiting

105
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,879
www.disabilitydenials.com

106
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,849
the same thing it's all the same

107
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,220
approach it's all got the same idea

108
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,069
behind it so let's jump right into a

109
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,349
grow lesson what we're gonna talk about

110
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,479
bottoming lolli popping and shaving the

111
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:43,300
legs that is the what let's talk about

112
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,038
why we want to do that what is the point

113
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,960
of and we'll talk more about what

114
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:48,219
bottoming and lolli popping and shaving

115
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,409
the leg is legs are that's just the

116
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,690
basics of what we're gonna cover why do

117
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,630
we want to do this sort of technique in

118
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:57,459
a small grow in a large grow in any type

119
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,529
of grow environment much of the stuff on

120
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,659
the bottom of your plant unless maybe

121
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,788
you're running a Coliseum grow much of

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,340
the crap on the bottom isn't going to be

123
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:08,709
a very useful but it's not gonna be

124
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:11,019
there not ending up with an A or B level

125
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,819
yeah that's gonna be the stuff that ends

126
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,228
up in the trim bin that you're going to

127
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,848
turn into concentrates or that you'll

128
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:17,709
make edibles out of but you'll be like

129
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:20,439
this is so small and annoying to trim I

130
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:22,839
don't want to [ __ ] with it we're talking

131
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,750
about stuff who's whose final potential

132
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,848
is at best to see yes and so it's just

133
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,279
it's so much easier to just remove it

134
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:31,839
from the equation way early before it

135
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,299
even has a chance to be part of the

136
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,149
equation and potentially even help the

137
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,340
butts up top oh for sure gets the plants

138
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,779
only got so much you know can only need

139
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,149
so much it can only dedicate so much

140
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,978
energy to growth and if you're taking

141
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:48,728
away energy it could be spending growing

142
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:51,189
ass equality bottom nug to a coal up top

143
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,389
by all means do it for sure you guys got

144
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,769
the right idea and we're not gonna get

145
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,418
light down there that's why those nodes

146
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:56,829
are gonna be crappy there's not gonna be

147
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,930
any light the light gets knocked by

148
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,728
every leaf every bud on the way down so

149
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,530
by the time we get down there to the

150
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:04,418
bottom you just got a little popcorn we

151
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,250
call it larf where I'm from yeah that's

152
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,810
got a different name yeah it's got a

153
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,279
different name in every circle but it's

154
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,800
Laura fits little fluffy crap we don't

155
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,619
need that also by taking off a lot of

156
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,718
the unnecessary crap we increase the

157
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,189
airflow and by increasing air flow we

158
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:21,579
increase the overall health of the

159
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:24,158
entire room excuse me and reduce the

160
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,348
likelihood of a number of negative

161
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,870
events there you go we reduce humidity

162
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:30,279
we reduce respiration and transpiration

163
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,889
we've reduced the opportunity for

164
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,439
powdery mildew with less foliage those

165
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,418
are less places for pests to hide also

166
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,788
it is easier and more effective when we

167
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,899
do apply a pesticide if we're applying a

168
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,759
spray even

169
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:45,638
stupid stuff like you can see better you

170
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,250
can get to the pot and and water it

171
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,900
easier you can see if the spray nozzles

172
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,160
on your watering system are functioning

173
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,069
properly all of it

174
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,320
absolutely that's that's perfect so many

175
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,939
good ideas go ahead Matt and it's it's

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,099
kind of strange specific - its kind of

177
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,500
one of those things where you want to

178
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,350
know the plant you're working with maybe

179
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,839
the first time you do it you you don't

180
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,080
go as hard go go light and slowly work

181
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,879
up you can't breathe you can't glue leaf

182
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,918
back on but you can take off more

183
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,509
tomorrow or the day after exactly and it

184
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,779
I've got that written down on how much

185
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,250
it's strain dependent and it's also

186
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,679
environmentally dependent if you've got

187
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,509
a room with a lot of light you're going

188
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,189
to produce more relief you're going to

189
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,228
produce more branch you're going to need

190
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,180
to cut off more stuff if you've got big

191
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:33,279
pots you're gonna produce bigger plants

192
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,098
with more [ __ ] to cut off if you've got

193
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,079
something like an OG Kush it grows like

194
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,490
kind of lanky you're not gonna want to

195
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,870
take off as much [ __ ] off the bottom

196
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,490
because you won't leave as much stuff up

197
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,590
the top if you've got something like

198
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,180
strawberry starburst she gets branchy

199
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,469
you could probably take off quite a bit

200
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,810
of that bottom stuff so it's very

201
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,419
strained dependent it's very environment

202
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,889
dependent if you've got weak lights you

203
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:55,509
don't want to take off as much or you

204
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,129
may need to take off even more you're

205
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,300
not going to get as much growth but

206
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,250
you're also not going to get as much

207
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,020
light penetration so you've got to do

208
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,459
that do I take this off do I leave it as

209
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,408
the light then I get to it there's a

210
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,430
decision to me to be made when it comes

211
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:09,848
to bottom and we'll talk about that

212
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,408
pretty soon but we want to kind of clean

213
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:13,870
up the bottoms let's talk about what I

214
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,370
mean by lolli popping and bottoming and

215
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,949
shaving the legs it's basically all the

216
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,908
same thing but slightly different

217
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,919
variations of the same words by

218
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:23,168
bottoming I mean so you've got a plant

219
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,759
that's growing naturally it's got a it

220
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,959
looks like a Christmas tree yeah sort of

221
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,250
looks like a Christmas tree but on the

222
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,899
bottom you've got multiple branches

223
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,908
coming out and then up higher you got

224
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,949
more branches those bottom branches are

225
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:34,599
probably thin and wispy maybe some of

226
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,669
them are kind of substantial but you can

227
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,680
see where the light doesn't get to if

228
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:40,899
you take those branches off the bottom

229
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,489
you don't waste that energy like we're

230
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,899
talking about earlier weight growing

231
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,669
those bottom buds that aren't going to

232
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,889
amount to anything then you can put the

233
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:49,509
energy from that plant up to the top

234
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,588
you've still got the same root space or

235
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,539
going to feed the same amount of

236
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,220
nutrients it's like if I just took your

237
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,699
backpack off of you and told you to run

238
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,170
laps

239
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,940
don't have that backpack you can go a

240
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,139
little bit faster we're just gonna make

241
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,240
that plant a little bit more

242
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,610
high-performance so that's basically

243
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,860
bottoming take that crap off the bottom

244
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,509
now when I talk about lolli popping

245
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,129
there are a couple that's kind of the

246
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,529
same thing as bottoming but I like to

247
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,480
work my way I kind of determine how far

248
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,370
the light is going to penetrate I do a

249
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,500
little defoliation so I can see where

250
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,850
the light gets down then I'm looking at

251
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,919
my plant I see the light doesn't get to

252
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,740
about this branch any branch below there

253
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,079
it's coming off then branches that reach

254
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,840
or branches that have potential to get

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,850
up to the light I clean them up tore

256
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,190
just the tips may have some leaves at

257
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,409
the end don't feel afraid to have a

258
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,730
naked branch with just a tip if the tips

259
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,159
are reaching up to where they will get

260
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,430
enough light if you're hanging a trellis

261
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:45,299
I basically lollipop everything below

262
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:47,799
the first net yep and this is really

263
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,120
important in developing your canopy you

264
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,579
know especially if you want a really

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,159
even canopy where everything comes out

266
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,009
consistent all the way across

267
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,730
you know lollipop popping up is gonna

268
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,740
really increase your upper canopy how

269
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,779
this works in practice really depends on

270
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,000
your growth style and method in your

271
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,250
plans for your plans absolutely how much

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,830
you cut off when and how and why you do

273
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,389
it it all is kind of about your goal but

274
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,250
we we've all got kind of the right idea

275
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:16,870
to just clean up that bottom part and

276
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,250
kind of get more energy up to the top

277
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,810
and also like you said it will help work

278
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,669
on the canopy we all want that even

279
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,739
canopy most of us want a nice even

280
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,139
canopy in a commercial environment a big

281
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,789
one giant glory bud that donkey dick to

282
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,159
take pictures of that's useless we need

283
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:31,959
a bunch of usable product that is very

284
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,909
uniform if you've got one big bud you've

285
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,590
got problems you can get mold in there

286
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:36,909
you can get mildew in there you don't

287
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,860
want all that you just want a bunch of

288
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:41,110
consistent bud so we spread it out using

289
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,149
a screen so I would use one screen to

290
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,409
spread a plants growing straight up and

291
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,059
branching straight up I would put a

292
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:47,829
screen down you know all those branches

293
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,269
that are going straight up I would kind

294
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,310
of spread them out a little bit so after

295
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,620
going straight up neither got some sort

296
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:55,449
of what's that horizontal growth the net

297
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,190
slows them down then they kind of fill

298
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,740
more space instead of going up you've

299
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,510
got more square footage wide I would put

300
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,340
that first net down let them grow up a

301
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,139
little bit let them grow into the second

302
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,300
net and then flower them everything

303
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,409
below that first net you've got what I

304
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,359
call a little sucker

305
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,129
just little finger size little there

306
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,449
shoots is what they are there's little

307
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,800
worthless shoots that aren't going to

308
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:16,479
measure up to much if it's smaller than

309
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,338
a pencil and a commercial grow I

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,440
basically cut it off of the main branch

311
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,690
so you've got branches they come up from

312
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,279
the bottom all of the non substantial

313
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,350
branches come off you leave the main

314
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,240
branches all the way up toward the light

315
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,569
happens you take off all that sucker

316
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,068
crap and all the leaves so that's what I

317
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,899
give you or what we call in a commercial

318
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,578
environment nice-looking shape legs you

319
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,139
just see those sexy stalks those nice

320
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:40,870
shave legs and then your canopy kind of

321
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,060
makes like a skirt yeah and you know

322
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:48,100
developing your canopy across there is

323
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:50,349
just gonna give you that consistency in

324
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,610
your product though the lower stuffs

325
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,810
never gonna help you out

326
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,818
it's never gonna get the light

327
00:11:52,809 --> 00:12:00,369
penetration you have to think of it kind

328
00:11:54,818 --> 00:12:05,469
of like the old slide slap slide windows

329
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:07,688
where they closed with the with a little

330
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,720
drawstring okay kind of like blind well

331
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:12,188
I guess bucking just blind [ __ ] a

332
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,889
high I'm sorry we took dad's at school

333
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:17,110
but anyway it works like blind sure your

334
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:19,240
family's blocking out a lot of that

335
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,600
light it's not getting through to those

336
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,899
bottom things unless you're doing like

337
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,909
vertical growing like where I'm doing

338
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:32,230
they'll kind of open up and direct

339
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:33,909
themselves towards the light and work

340
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,100
themselves towards whichever direction

341
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:37,929
but if you're doing standard canopy in

342
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,889
training you're gonna get a lot more

343
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:44,019
success from your top end and remember

344
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,879
that you can't glue [ __ ] back on once

345
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,539
you cut it off so cut a little bit kind

346
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,789
of check it out go slower yeah yeah we

347
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:54,370
always recommend if you're gonna try a

348
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:58,000
new technique or a new product to try it

349
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,679
on one or two plants and wait for a few

350
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,778
days or a week and see how that plant

351
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,370
reacts rather than do it to the whole

352
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:06,338
garden and come in tomorrow morning to

353
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,169
realize you you read the label wrong and

354
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,300
now all your plants are dead yeah well

355
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:12,698
it goes back to setting yourself up for

356
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:15,789
success to you know all of those steps

357
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:17,469
you're doing in preparation for flowers

358
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,539
so that way when you go to flip

359
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,850
everything is just going to be spot-on

360
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,179
and ready and you know you even do some

361
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,399
of that

362
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,469
in flower but all of that is just

363
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,309
preparation so the plant can develop to

364
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,810
be exactly what you intended so with

365
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,939
that in mind you've got to think about

366
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,009
what is this plant going to look like in

367
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,779
three days what's it gonna look like in

368
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:39,370
a wheat what will it look like in ten

369
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,179
days or two weeks because of what I'm

370
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,950
doing right now

371
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,838
so when you pull off those little shoots

372
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,640
those won't grow back when you cut off

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,430
those branches they will not grow back

374
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,019
the plants grow from the top all the new

375
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:51,579
growth comes out of the top so don't

376
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,379
expect anything down on the bottom to

377
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,879
replace itself I know some people

378
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,919
thought will want that stuff grow back

379
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,909
no you cut it off turd it's not coming

380
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:03,579
back it's gone it is gone any good if

381
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:05,110
you're not a familiar with the cannabis

382
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,450
plant and you're totally lost right now

383
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,889
what we're talking about is taking a

384
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,899
plant that wants to grow like a

385
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,629
Christmas tree and making it grow like a

386
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:16,179
menorah basically with the goal of an

387
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,500
increase overall harvest weight so

388
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,028
basically in a commercial environment

389
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,070
when we move the plants into the room

390
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:22,659
they start growing we've got a table and

391
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,670
the table is filled with three gallon

392
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,439
pots that are in Nice straight lines if

393
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,819
you look down the row you can't see

394
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,100
through the road to the other end of the

395
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,080
room when I get done bottoming and Lolly

396
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,028
popping and shaving the legs it's like a

397
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,560
tunnel you could see all the way down to

398
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:38,409
the other end of that table there's like

399
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,269
a good 12 to 16 maybe 18 inch gap or you

400
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:44,009
could just see nothing but sexy-looking

401
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:47,230
shaped legs and irrigation lines it

402
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,480
there's a the scene in the horror movie

403
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,670
where like the lights kind of on and off

404
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,070
and the scary thing like moves real fast

405
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,599
up the hallway like in chunks like the

406
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,520
either the lights are going off and it's

407
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,500
getting darker coming close to you or

408
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,639
the scary things running at you like

409
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,649
that there's so many things going to

410
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,750
grow like filling up a room with plants

411
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,250
I would always take pictures that made

412
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,009
it look like the plants were rushing up

413
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,159
behind me like that filling up or going

414
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,389
through and in lollipop in a room like

415
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,120
after the first day you can see the

416
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,259
first four rows deep and by the end of

417
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,179
the week you can see all the way through

418
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:20,528
the [ __ ] big room and it's weird cuz

419
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,870
you can never see all the way through

420
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:24,850
the big room but if you duck down right

421
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,110
now you can see like 200 yards down the

422
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,389
row

423
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,039
yeah people just went 200 yards how big

424
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,809
is your grow room you should see some of

425
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,789
the show we got good I always laugh when

426
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,319
I read about big busts I just saw one

427
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:37,870
that the cops had online where it was

428
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,060
literally 8 1 grand baggies of weed on

429
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,500
the table and they were like busted

430
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,049
another one going into whatever venue

431
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,159
and I was like oh dude I could just post

432
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,990
some pictures from work where there's

433
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,699
more Keef than that on a tray that's

434
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,980
about to get swept into the hash bag

435
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,500
just cuz yeah that's what we do with it

436
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,870
here what are you guys doing out there

437
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,769
on the East Coast come on I'll catch up

438
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,209
all right like you're gonna get some

439
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,009
hate mail coming let's bail you out hey

440
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,949
mail it you're in the quick state

441
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:03,939
quicksand um so we are we're trying to

442
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,220
get more airflow we're trying to move

443
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,149
that crap that the plants would grow on

444
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,829
the bottom we're trying to basically

445
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,360
know that off and put that energy up the

446
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:12,578
top so we can get those big fat juicy

447
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,870
buds that we're looking for you might

448
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:15,789
want to spread that out with the trellis

449
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,528
either way I do recommend a bottoming

450
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:19,240
and lolli popping and shaving the legs

451
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,009
it makes the room look better it makes

452
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
it easier to water it gets that you

453
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,309
don't want leaves hanging down on the

454
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,049
pots and in the soil anyway that just

455
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,268
helps you out getting bugs by cleaning

456
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:29,649
up the inside you help get airflow in

457
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,539
there that helps you prevent bud rot it

458
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,860
also helps move that energy out to the

459
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:35,078
ends of the plants to get you bigger

460
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,759
fatter buds it's a pretty simple

461
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,679
technique you just want to take off

462
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,088
anything that you think the branching

463
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,069
you have to be selective with the

464
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,360
branching decide what branches you want

465
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,589
to leave you can always take more off

466
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,389
later if it doesn't look like it's gonna

467
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,649
be worth of [ __ ] cut it off you can do

468
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,600
this and we're gonna talk about timing

469
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,620
next you can do this in the flower so

470
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,839
you don't have to make your decision

471
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,820
today all those little suckers that are

472
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,990
just little tiny shoots take those off

473
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,750
they're not gonna be worth a [ __ ]

474
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,149
basically anything on the bottom third

475
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,500
of the plant or so can be removed if

476
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,269
it's going to be tiny you don't want to

477
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,230
go up high doing this kind of stuff on

478
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,879
the plant then you'll stunt the growth

479
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,679
you'll start taking off potential blood

480
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,089
sites but the stuff on the bottom feel

481
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,559
free to go ahead and chop that off of

482
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,088
there now you might want to start like

483
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,578
the first time and work your way up or

484
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:17,889
like Mike said maybe [ __ ] one plan up on

485
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:19,568
a level 10 [ __ ] one up level seven go a

486
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,919
little lighter on each plant the

487
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:23,740
experiment don't go harder than their

488
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,299
first try go slow and learn now if you

489
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,949
are going to top your plants a lot of

490
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:28,660
people like the top there we go next

491
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,740
episode will be about topping let's

492
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,210
write that down there we go

493
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,160
topping we're gonna talk about topping

494
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,808
the plants the next episode but top them

495
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,519
first because think about this what if

496
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:38,139
you bought them you lollipop in any

497
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,339
top-up now you already gonna [ __ ] up

498
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,620
the height of your play took off two

499
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:43,079
months

500
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,609
so top them first that is a good idea

501
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,168
that we should mention now top them

502
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,758
before you do bottom and Lolly popping

503
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,340
maybe put them in the trellis before you

504
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,829
do the bottom and Lolly popping now this

505
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,418
part is kind of up for a lot everything

506
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,949
I'm talking about people have their own

507
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,240
method and approach people will say that

508
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,580
they do in a different way that is fine

509
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,579
this is the most debatable part of this

510
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:05,730
the when to do the bottoming the lolli

511
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:08,579
popping and the shaving of the legs you

512
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,649
can do this just before flower or you

513
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:13,408
can do this all the way up to the start

514
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:15,298
of week three or you can start at the

515
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,850
beginning of flower and continue all the

516
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,558
way into the middle of week three it

517
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:21,269
just kind of depends on what you want to

518
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,460
do if you've taken some off and you

519
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,048
realize oh those plants got much larger

520
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,759
after they went into flower and I can

521
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,829
probably clean them up more feel free go

522
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,000
for it you can pull off the bottoms you

523
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,259
can clean that [ __ ] up

524
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,148
all the way into week three without

525
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,589
causing too much problems if you need to

526
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:36,058
take off a full branch at some point

527
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,009
you're not gonna harm the plant just by

528
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:41,638
whacking one off I think if you're

529
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:45,000
worried too about that if like how the

530
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:47,638
plant is going to react to your tear

531
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,169
defoliation techniques being in veg when

532
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:51,599
you do it can be a little safer of a

533
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,129
technique because you can give it more

534
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,288
of a chance to bounce back from any

535
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:57,898
damage you do like if your first time or

536
00:18:55,288 --> 00:19:00,960
for sure and you're like I'm not sure

537
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:02,250
how much to take off so you know if

538
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,009
you're a little worried about that just

539
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,740
try take off somewhat some of the lower

540
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:09,028
stuff and kind of work your way and you

541
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,220
know with experience you'll get more

542
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,750
comfortable yeah at all you'll get an

543
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,190
idea of what the shape you expect from

544
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,778
your plant for your environment so

545
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,879
you'll learn how to start shaping that

546
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:19,200
and then you can start kind of working

547
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:21,480
back like I'm saying now to do this

548
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,798
right before flower once you get better

549
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,048
at shaping the plant you can do it

550
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,908
earlier and veg and earlier in veg and

551
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:29,009
you can start shaping that plant exactly

552
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,840
how you want it from early and from the

553
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,429
time you get a clone started you can say

554
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,168
oh I'm gonna want these branches gone

555
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,028
for sure I'm gonna want these branches

556
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,528
here for sure and then by removing a

557
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:39,269
bunch of the [ __ ] from the bottom early

558
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:41,220
on you actually do the same idea you

559
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:43,048
send that up to the top and veg as well

560
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,379
is you're not wasting crap on that

561
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:47,730
bottom not wasting nutrients energy

562
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:49,288
pesticides if you're spraying you're not

563
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,788
wasting all that crap on the bottom

564
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,109
there so go ahead and pull that stuff

565
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:55,148
off send some energy up to the top

566
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,349
you know what I'm talking about that

567
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,969
part down in the bottom part of the

568
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:59,469
plant that just looks like it looks like

569
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,819
a chia pet grown on your [ __ ] weed

570
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,618
plant it's not worth anything it's just

571
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,849
a little foliage that's where the spider

572
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,079
mites want to hang out that's where the

573
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:07,480
powdery mildew wants to go it's where

574
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,949
the thrips want to be oh the thing I

575
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,778
hear people talking themselves into

576
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,038
keeping it as they go it's ash mature

577
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:13,749
it'll be ash material it'll be ash

578
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,970
material there's gonna be plenty of that

579
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:17,710
just get rid of it yeah please just

580
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,649
you'll be happier with yourself if you

581
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,149
do it also a lot of times if you have

582
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:23,918
genetics that you aren't too sure about

583
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:26,319
taking off some of those can be a good

584
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,049
idea as well because generally they like

585
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,548
to harm towards the bottom towards life

586
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,259
if you aren't sure if the genetics are

587
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:34,658
gonna be solid or not you know taking

588
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,700
off some of those lower energy can kind

589
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:38,799
of be a lifesaver from not pollinating

590
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,600
out your entire flower room yeah it'll

591
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,888
show you that's yeah it'll show you if

592
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,238
it's gonna be a hermit I'll show you

593
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:44,528
that down lower where there's not a lot

594
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,840
of light that's where you see the hard

595
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:48,220
parts for sure which it'll still like

596
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,199
you know if it's gonna hurt it's gonna

597
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,788
hurt but right that might buy you some

598
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,980
time anybody able to see it if it's not

599
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:57,220
down there in the middle yeah hell yeah

600
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,889
I always laugh the the day after a big

601
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,440
defoliation run was always hey I found

602
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:04,988
six sprayer heads that are clogged and

603
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,700
it's you can you can see everything

604
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:08,409
better you can you can get it and work

605
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,879
your plan better the plant gets more

606
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,739
light on every piece that's growing

607
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:13,148
better you can see what you're doing

608
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:16,329
better you can see your equipment better

609
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:18,548
I think there's so many benefits to this

610
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:20,678
so many and I've seen people do some

611
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:24,668
really amazing things with the cannabis

612
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,548
plant with bottoming topping sprouting

613
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,609
lollies popping in like I've seen it

614
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:33,638
grow long and down a row where one plant

615
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:35,349
grows halfway down a backyard just every

616
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:36,849
couple of feet and other branch goes up

617
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,038
and it keeps moving forward and it was

618
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,269
just every summer or every day that

619
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,739
summer the grower went out there and

620
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,169
grabbed the top and dumped it under the

621
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:45,879
next rung of the fence this if you take

622
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,070
your time then you can work this plant

623
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:50,319
into any shape or mould you need to fit

624
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:52,689
your grow space you just need to take

625
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,548
your time and practice yeah and it just

626
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,590
goes back to knowing your space like you

627
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:57,819
just said you know knowing what you're

628
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:59,858
working with and what you're trying to

629
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,418
accomplish in the end you know if you

630
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:03,249
want a plant that's going to be really

631
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,990
short and squatty and bushy you can

632
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,589
accomplish that even with a strain that

633
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,599
isn't

634
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:10,149
going to naturally want to do that just

635
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,189
by you know training it properly you can

636
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,440
bend and pop you can do all kinds of

637
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,909
topping stuff we'll talk about in the

638
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,558
future if got popping and twisting in

639
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:19,600
the other episode coming on yeah good

640
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:21,569
but good hype but yeah you know there's

641
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,599
a lot of techniques you can do to really

642
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,879
make this plan into anything you want

643
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,099
didn't when you've done a run a strand a

644
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,820
couple of grows in a row and really got

645
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:36,369
a feel for how the plant grows you can

646
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:39,609
find ways to maximize that strain in

647
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:40,928
your space with your method and I mean

648
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,209
I've seen some growers just some really

649
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,940
beautiful things with with this stuff so

650
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,679
play with it play with it make sure you

651
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:52,120
having fun that's the most in take notes

652
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,130
and for new Gers a lot of people will

653
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,069
successfully do this by setting up a

654
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,919
string so that way they can across there

655
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:01,990
kind of canopy area where they're gonna

656
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,669
lollipop too and it gives you a more

657
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,048
consistent all the way through your tank

658
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,028
you know if you have like a trellis

659
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:08,679
system run one string across the bottom

660
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:10,450
all the stuff that's not getting light

661
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,179
and that way take off everything below

662
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,069
that and it'll it'll be more consistent

663
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:17,380
that way too and I think that's a good

664
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:20,558
way for new people to kind of get an

665
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:24,250
idea okay this is going to be just a

666
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:28,210
beer - yeah yeah yeah like drawing a

667
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,950
chalk line perfect so the main idea is

668
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,038
to take off all that crop off the bottom

669
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,390
increase airflow prevent problems you

670
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,908
want to do it basically about the bottom

671
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,038
third you can do it starting early or

672
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:41,799
late and veg you can continue to do so I

673
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,750
recommend a nice bottoming lolly popping

674
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,009
and cleaning up kind of about the second

675
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,569
week of flower you can see where your

676
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,890
little bud sites are gonna be you can

677
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,869
see which bud sites are going to be

678
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,038
worth a [ __ ] and what's not go in there

679
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,509
and just take off anything that you

680
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,548
think is a waste of time a waste of

681
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,109
space if you won't turn into a bud that

682
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:57,879
is worth trimming you probably don't

683
00:23:56,109 --> 00:24:00,069
want it on there it depends on your goal

684
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,870
honestly in most cases in a commercial

685
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:03,609
environment if it's not as least as big

686
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:04,808
as my pinky or my thumb

687
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,759
we don't trim that that becomes

688
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:09,700
concentrate so think about that when it

689
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,500
comes to taking stuff off don't go too

690
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,509
hard you can't put [ __ ] back but you can

691
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,609
always take more off if you see that a

692
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:17,259
branch just isn't performing you've got

693
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:18,398
those little branches that just stick up

694
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,388
in the middle of the plant feel free to

695
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:21,428
take those off you

696
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:22,988
see that increases airflow the plants

697
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:24,999
will just look happier it just looks

698
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:26,709
like a happier cleaner canopy in there

699
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,149
and if that's not for you don't do it

700
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:31,089
that's simply how it goes

701
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:32,708
give it a defoliation first clean up the

702
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:35,200
bottoms and then if you're gonna top

703
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:36,849
make sure you top first also because you

704
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,109
don't want to bottom and then expect to

705
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,808
have another foot that you just cut off

706
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:42,069
the plant that'll throw you off you guys

707
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:43,269
got any more input before we start

708
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:45,548
wrapping up this episode I feel like we

709
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:50,229
gave a pretty decent lesson on bottoming

710
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:52,269
our cannabis plants I think you know

711
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:54,519
with strain dependent I've also had

712
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:56,709
strains where you know they golf-ball

713
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,719
out real hard and they stretch their

714
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:00,788
arms in a way that you don't have to

715
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:02,919
defy Lee or take off as much of the

716
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:05,679
lowers because they all just golf bug

717
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,809
ball up and and nice big den snugs all

718
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,259
the way through those strains are kind

719
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:12,759
of rare and you know you don't come

720
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,429
across ones that grow in that pattern

721
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,528
often but some ghost og and Ghost Dog

722
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,179
sort of stuff yeah yeah definitely you

723
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:20,798
know try different techniques with

724
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:23,229
whatever you're working with and and

725
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,819
gate proficient in that because just the

726
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:31,028
experience is gonna increase your

727
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:33,638
overall growth knowledge happiness

728
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:35,469
experience the harvest yield potency all

729
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:37,328
the above all increase yeah yes are ya

730
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:39,308
know your stone we're all stone to don't

731
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:43,450
worry I know how to bail us out cemetry

732
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:46,148
in in getting a good equal defoliation

733
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,558
through your grow is huge and it gets a

734
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:49,808
guy I've seen this become a major

735
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:54,069
problem and grows as small as like four

736
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:56,168
lights I mean if you've got three or

737
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:57,968
five gallon pots and the plants get to a

738
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:59,079
decent size and you go to fully and when

739
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:00,548
you're talking about several hours of

740
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:02,378
the work depending on the amount of

741
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:05,888
lollipop and and whatnot you're doing

742
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:08,168
and the first plan gets perfect exactly

743
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:10,808
what you want the second plank it's

744
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,940
about the same the third plan get to 85%

745
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:15,069
the last plant gets like twenty five

746
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,690
percent of what you intended to do and

747
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,788
that causes all sorts of weird problems

748
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,578
in your grow from air for airflow and

749
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:23,919
light problems to a little pests

750
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:25,989
concentrations and just try to make it

751
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,239
even even if that means given the first

752
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,769
plant in eighty so that you can give all

753
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:31,869
the plants in the room in eighty you

754
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:33,190
know what I mean and I'm back tomorrow

755
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:36,038
and do the last 20

756
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,679
and I think another thing people miss is

757
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,710
when you first transplant into like a 1

758
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,499
or 3 or 5 gallon you know you're gonna

759
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,239
have a lot of lower stuff or on on your

760
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:47,919
plant you can go ahead and you know take

761
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:49,960
a lot of that lower stuff off in veg

762
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,999
that's going to touch the soil because

763
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,098
that stuff's gonna you know it's going

764
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,419
to be bad for your plant there's a lot

765
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:58,689
of things in your soil that you don't

766
00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:00,099
want getting systemic into your plant so

767
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,320
go ahead and take all that stuff off

768
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:04,210
that it looks like it's gonna touch the

769
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,298
soil or could potentially touch the soil

770
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,358
you know early on go ahead and start

771
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:11,108
taking some of that lower foliage off

772
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:12,579
yeah I agree

773
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,378
start cleaning it up you know starts in

774
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:15,428
and then all that stuff that you're

775
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:16,449
feeding to the plants has to go

776
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,679
somewhere and if you've got little

777
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,690
straggler shoots and leaves that you

778
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,129
don't need you can use that energy in a

779
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,840
better spot like I said earlier it's

780
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:24,098
like taking off your backpack or if

781
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,449
you're taking off crap on the bottom

782
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:26,950
it's like taking off your shackles or

783
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,479
ankle weights or maybe just a heavy

784
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,159
anklet or something maybe taking off

785
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,629
those baggy Genco jeans that Mike wears

786
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,359
give him the ability to run a little

787
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:36,189
faster camera I'm sure you can't run in

788
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:37,778
those but can you run without I think if

789
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,330
I gave you running shoes and shorts are

790
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:42,788
you still gonna run I'm able but usually

791
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:44,408
a Louie yeah yeah we need four dogs and

792
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:49,720
two cops if we need Mike to blow up with

793
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:55,090
a dog if you got a dog dog don't listen

794
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:57,879
to me just but also uh sucker branches I

795
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,648
call him on the bottoms that you'll have

796
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:01,028
where you're almost tempted to keep them

797
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:02,888
where they kind of go halfway up the

798
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:05,229
plant and you're like ah it might do

799
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:07,329
something I just go ahead and get rid

800
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:08,919
yeah thing is it's not gonna yeah and

801
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:10,928
even if it does stretch you're just

802
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,249
potentially taking away from all the

803
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:13,659
other stuff that could have done way

804
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:15,190
better it's gonna need a stick or

805
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,289
something to hold it up anyway don't

806
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,429
waste your time with it yeah and a lot

807
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:21,489
of what we said like we keep talking

808
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:23,288
about is strain dependent some lens are

809
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:25,210
gonna love this some plants won't need

810
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:26,618
it it's also environment dependent if

811
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,210
you've got a lot of light you're going

812
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:30,038
to produce more playing roads you'll

813
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,079
have more shoots also you're going to

814
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:33,489
have more canopy penetration so you'll

815
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,079
have to do the equation on there where

816
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:37,598
do I take this off how much do I take

817
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,668
off when do I stop keep in mind I keep

818
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:42,308
saying it you can always cut more off I

819
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:44,589
don't have any plant glue I don't know

820
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:46,930
how to glue those branches back no you

821
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:48,759
don't want to be nice with that

822
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,980
if you're trying to glue [ __ ] back onto

823
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,349
your cannabis plant you have gone into a

824
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,480
sad and strange place you know some

825
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:57,099
angry troll in a safety meeting if

826
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,720
you're trying to glue [ __ ] back on it's

827
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,399
time for safety meeting some angry

828
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,069
trollers fingers just blew a plant

829
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,780
crafting plant crafting you could do an

830
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,339
apple tree so we were like you don't

831
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,049
want to do with a 90-day harvesting

832
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:10,480
plant one of my favorite things to do is

833
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,159
in a trim room when right after I cut

834
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,259
down a bunch of plants like a whole room

835
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,000
a hundred plants I take a couple out to

836
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,259
the trimmers and I get them going and

837
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,759
then I'll get them trim and let them

838
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,930
trim for an hour or so and then you know

839
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,160
I always go check on the trim crew so

840
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,630
I'll walk up and I'll pick a bud

841
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,860
it's like trend and I'll look at it and

842
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,510
I'll look mad and I go what's wrong

843
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:27,339
though plants aren't done put them back

844
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:32,319
and they all give you this what though

845
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:34,209
oh man I like domestic trimmers it's fun

846
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,859
and and metric people also there's

847
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,690
another fun one if you work in they do

848
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,059
this oh this is a good one I was not fun

849
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,320
if you work in the cannabis regulated

850
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,460
cannabis industry and you've got plant

851
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,409
tags that are required to be on your

852
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,450
plants walk out of a room with a lot of

853
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,950
plants and find your compliance person

854
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,900
or the person in charge of the tags and

855
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,880
go why don't any of the plants in that

856
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,440
room have tags and watch the look on

857
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,850
their face because those plants must

858
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,200
have tags and if they don't have tags

859
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,789
they're going to get fired and we're

860
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,410
gonna get a lot of fines and to watch

861
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:01,210
them frantically piss their pants and

862
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,310
try to figure out how to tag 300 plants

863
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,140
right now it's kind of a funny thing to

864
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:08,440
play on people I like walking into the

865
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,240
dry room and go so I guess we're not

866
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,190
taking any fresh frozen this round huh

867
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,059
and watching the trim is you're freaked

868
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,519
the [ __ ] out oh [ __ ] that's an inside

869
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,169
industry joke that's [ __ ] funny it's

870
