00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,340
time for a fresh episode of the grill

27
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:04,109
from your heart podcast welcome to the

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,359
podcast everybody just a quick intro

29
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,890
today I have a lot planned for you you

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,390
know I like to start the episodes off by

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,579
letting you know what I'm smoking on

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,609
today I'm taking dad's of member berry

33
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,959
nectar from Green Dot labs member berry

34
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,849
is from our friends at the ethos

35
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,618
collective member berry is skunk berry

36
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,780
cross to the mandarins sunset that's a

37
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,519
great cross the description on the

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,890
package says it will taste like cheese

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,408
Smarties candies orange peel and

40
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,790
overwhelming fruit punch you know I

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,430
would have to agree with that as soon as

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,479
you open the concentrate container a

43
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,920
smell of cheese hits you right in the

44
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:36,599
face it's not it's kind of like a a

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,219
sharp cheddar comes right out of the

46
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,539
package right into your face you get the

47
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,039
sharp cheddar then you lean in and you

48
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,380
smell more and that's when the candy

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,799
flavor kind of comes in you get that

50
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,109
Smarties

51
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,240
maybe a fruit punch flavor there then

52
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,549
when you dab it that's on the Smarties

53
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,500
candies the overwhelming fruit punch

54
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,360
takes over and then after the exhale

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,340
that orange peel kind of kicks in so

56
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,500
it's a really complex flavored

57
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,180
concentrate I really enjoy it and now

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,009
this Graham is not gonna last long I'm

59
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,420
gonna smoke this [ __ ] out of that so

60
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,640
ladies gentlemen I'm smoking on the

61
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,038
member berry nectar from Green Dot labs

62
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,568
and his great concentrates I've got a

63
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,539
lot of information to pack into this

64
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:15,699
episode so let's move right into the

65
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:18,489
I'm sure a lot of my listeners already

66
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:20,318
for a deep dive into some grow lessons

67
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,700
so let's get right into it and let's

68
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,988
talk about enzymes in growing cannabis

69
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,789
all right before we get into this I do

70
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,158
need to give some credit I always shout

71
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:32,169
out to green culture magazine.com I

72
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:34,568
wanted to give my brain a refresher and

73
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:37,718
enzymes before I recorded a show I typed

74
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:39,638
in growing with enzymes on my google

75
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:41,858
browser and the first article that came

76
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,260
up was green culture magazine.com

77
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:47,560
I honestly went through several articles

78
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:50,019
and this article explained it the best

79
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,329
the most thorough accurate simplest

80
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,430
understandable description so I borrowed

81
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,169
a lot of the information from this

82
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,060
website please don't accuse me of

83
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,310
stealing it telling you straight up this

84
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,650
was my source so green culture

85
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,139
magazine.com is where the bulk of this

86
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,599
information was updated from in my brain

87
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,730
so I owe them a shout-out there is my

88
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,068
footnote to start the show all right now

89
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,168
let's talk about enzymes what is an

90
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,789
enzyme now don't worry if I lose you

91
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,409
here in the beginning because eventually

92
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:19,478
this will all click and I promise it

93
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:22,120
will make sense by the end what is an

94
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,699
enzyme enzymes are proteins made of

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,739
complex chains of amino acids folded

96
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,790
into shapes that resemble a pacman now

97
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,739
that doesn't mean a lot to a lot of us

98
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:35,048
right now you've got you see what it's a

99
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,969
protein it's a complex chain of amino

100
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,639
acids and it's shaped like pac-man

101
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,408
okay now that pac-man idea triggers

102
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,259
ideas in my head really quickly on how

103
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:47,289
to teach things enzymes are in your root

104
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:49,029
zone they're in the soil eating the bad

105
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,828
[ __ ] they're packed Manning up all the

106
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,209
dead roots they're packed Manning up all

107
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,709
the things we don't want in there the

108
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,199
enzymes are eating that stuff and

109
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,269
basically just in they're eating the

110
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,939
ghosts and the dots that's what these

111
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,188
pac-man shaped proteins are in there

112
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:06,519
doing now let's talk a little bit more

113
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:09,549
about enzymes enzymes help break things

114
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,650
down they also speed up the breakdown

115
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,109
process enzymes can also modify and

116
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,658
create other organisms enzymes occur

117
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,959
naturally and are necessary to all life

118
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:22,349
forms without enzymes life as we know it

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,829
probably could not exist

120
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,230
in nature bacterial microbes and fungus

121
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:32,159
excrete enzymes that live in symbiosis

122
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,470
with other living things until recently

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,330
scientists could not create enzymes they

124
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,970
can only harvest them from living

125
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,329
sources so now let's talk about some

126
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,640
actual uses of enzymes the most common

127
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:47,009
commercial uses of enzymes other than

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,169
alcohol production you need enzymes to

129
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,209
create alcohol enzymes are heavily used

130
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,850
in the alcohol industry but other common

131
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:56,909
uses enzymes were heavily used for

132
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,560
making laundry and dish detergents are

133
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,170
the enzymes and get in there and help

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,300
break down the old food or the organic

135
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,850
matter or whatever is stained on your

136
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,770
plate but the enzymes will wipe that

137
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,180
food right off of there or if you've got

138
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,379
some dirty clothes the enzymes will get

139
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,910
in there and break down that dirt and

140
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,100
that funk and get that [ __ ] right out of

141
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,290
your clothes so enzymes were used in

142
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,020
making laundry and dish detergents

143
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,810
enzymes are also used in septic tanks to

144
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,490
help break down the waste even further

145
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,040
so if you live in the mountains and you

146
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,290
don't have plumbing you've got a toilet

147
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,480
hooked up to some piping that goes to a

148
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,040
big tank that's buried underground and

149
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,110
basically when you flush the toilet all

150
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,879
your poop goes into this big tank and it

151
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,670
sits in this tank underground and it

152
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,769
does decompose over time but they fill

153
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,140
it with very specific enzymes and those

154
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:45,299
enzymes eat your poop and it dissolves

155
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,459
that poop right up so you don't get an

156
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,680
overflow from your septic system so

157
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,799
that's the sort of stuff that enzymes

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,829
are good for I've seen enzymes sold as

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,139
supplements in health food stores to aid

160
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,449
in digestion they offer the most common

161
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,250
that I've seen is a papaya enzyme it

162
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,039
comes in a tube or not a tube but a roll

163
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,500
it looks similar to like a tums or an

164
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,990
antacid of some sort and it's got that

165
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,430
foil thing around it and you unwrap it

166
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,930
you break one out of that and you chew

167
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,579
on it and they don't taste too bad

168
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,290
they're kind of chalky kind of powdery I

169
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,479
think there were mango and papaya over

170
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,180
the flavor that I had you chew on those

171
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,700
and the enzymes that are in there are

172
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,560
supposed to aid in food digestion it

173
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,449
helps you digest your food more smoothly

174
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,879
more quickly and it also is supposed to

175
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,099
help you uptake your nutrients more

176
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,540
thoroughly I didn't notice anything when

177
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,540
I ate it but I worked at the health food

178
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,370
store and they were samples so that's

179
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,700
I tried but that is another use for

180
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,620
enzymes all right I feel like now we

181
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,029
were becoming more familiar with an

182
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,220
enzyme we know what the enzyme actually

183
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,500
is and we understand a few practical

184
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,170
applications of the enzyme so it

185
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,970
shouldn't sound so foreign to us at this

186
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,560
point now let's talk a little bit more

187
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,360
about enzymes in cannabis growing

188
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,250
enzymes are very limited on function and

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,740
what that means is a cellulose enzyme

190
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,720
can only break down cellulose and

191
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,050
nothing else so you need specific

192
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,450
enzymes to do certain functions now an

193
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,850
enzyme can repeat its function millions

194
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,909
of times but it can also be deactivated

195
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,970
or destroyed by other enzymes by pH

196
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,939
swings by temperature or by a myriad of

197
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,190
other options that could happen in a

198
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,319
grow environment enzymes are fairly

199
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:30,199
stable but they are also slightly

200
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,750
delicate so let's talk about why we use

201
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,569
enzymes why are we buying enzymatic

202
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,750
products to add to our feeding solution

203
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,509
why are we doing this enzymes aid and

204
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,610
simple tasks like getting rid of dead

205
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,459
roots or more complex tasks like

206
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,000
accelerating plant growth and assisting

207
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,829
in hormone biosynthesis the most common

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,620
reason for adding enzymes to a high

209
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:58,909
performance garden is to keep the medium

210
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,639
clean no I talked earlier about using

211
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,950
enzymes in our septic tank and I talked

212
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,569
earlier about using enzymes in laundry

213
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,750
detergent and then I also talked about

214
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:11,360
using enzymes as a dietary supplement to

215
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,740
help people digest food and absorb

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
nutrients better now if you think about

217
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,970
all those uses we can kind of see how

218
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
that would transfer to our cannabis

219
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,900
plant if the enzymes are helping people

220
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,129
digest food and absorb nutrients better

221
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:23,689
that's probably gonna happen to our

222
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,730
cannabis plants now let's think about

223
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,560
that septic tank the enzymes are in

224
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,509
there breaking up the poop breaking up

225
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,160
the dead stuff that we don't want now

226
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,229
when your plants are growing some of the

227
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,210
roots are gonna die that is natural

228
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,910
you're gonna have Deacon decomposing

229
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,040
matter in your root zone those enzymes

230
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,379
are gonna get in there and eat that

231
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,799
stuff up and turn it into usable fuel

232
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:48,799
before it's able to become a problem

233
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,259
that is a vector for problems pathogens

234
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,028
and disease when you've got something

235
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,588
decaying in your root zone so these

236
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:56,689
enzymes will get in their own logo hey

237
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:57,950
look at that [ __ ] nom nom nom nom and

238
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,170
they'll chew it up and they'll turn it

239
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,070
into plant energy for your plants now

240
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,990
the same thing with the laundry

241
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,209
detergent it's getting in there breaking

242
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,560
things down it's cleaning it up it's

243
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,899
gonna get in there and break things down

244
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,819
and clean up your root zone so in short

245
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,049
terms these enzymes are getting in there

246
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,459
and acting like those Scrubbing Bubbles

247
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,169
remember the old commercials with the

248
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,729
scrubbing bubbles at Scrubbing Bubbles

249
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,919
and pac-man getting in there and eatin

250
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,509
the ghost eating the dots scrubbing the

251
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,549
bubbles getting the dead poop out

252
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:24,500
getting those dead roots out and keeping

253
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:27,139
your root zone healthy and clean so

254
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,940
enzymes kind of acts as a protectant may

255
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,939
be a security guard of sorts against

256
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,649
disease and pathogens within the root

257
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,970
zone so they're acting like those

258
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,740
Scrubbing Bubbles there and they're

259
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,200
scrubbing the problems out maybe those

260
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,750
dead roots are ghosts and little

261
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,220
pathogens and disease are the little

262
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,389
dots and they're just pac-man in the

263
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,459
[ __ ] out of those little things in there

264
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:48,049
just miss pac-man and pac-man just in

265
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:50,088
there to live in there pac-man Midway

266
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:51,500
life just chasing those ghosts around

267
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,420
alright let's get back on track you guys

268
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,190
earlier I mentioned that specific

269
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,889
enzymes can only perform specific

270
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,110
functions some enzyme products break

271
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,740
down dead roots some enzyme products

272
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,690
break down bad bacterias some enzyme

273
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,639
products help improve soil health by

274
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,820
breaking down dead material into useful

275
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,100
sugars and minerals now how do I know

276
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,290
which enzymes I need and which enzymes

277
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,089
I'm getting each company has their own

278
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,519
proprietary blend of enzymes that they

279
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,230
put in the bottle I'm gonna talk about a

280
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,179
test in a few minutes on ways we can

281
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,459
tell if there are a couple of enzymes in

282
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,199
there but basically unless you can do

283
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,929
these tests we've just got to trust

284
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,370
these companies but we'll talk more

285
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,588
about that in a minute so basically

286
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,899
enzymes act as an accelerator for

287
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,480
chemical reactions that are produced in

288
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,339
the soil and they do that by breaking

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,250
down or speeding up the breakdown

290
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,140
process of dead root matter of bad

291
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,759
bacteria of things that are unwelcome

292
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,370
and unwanted and they turn that into

293
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,528
usable sugars and minerals for the

294
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,959
plants so they're in there turning funk

295
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:56,689
into food for you is basically what your

296
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:58,519
enzymes are doing now most of your

297
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,839
commercially available bottled nutrients

298
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,149
are going to be made through

299
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,280
fermentation they ferment vegetable

300
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,909
which creates a Trichoderma which allows

301
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,829
the enzymes to spread they keep that

302
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:12,230
production happening then they collect

303
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,540
the enzymes into a bottle then they

304
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,490
dilute it then they sell it to us well

305
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,620
then they sell it to a distributor who

306
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,090
sells it to a gross store who then sells

307
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,549
it to us after it's been shipped across

308
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,980
the country so it's hard to know if the

309
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,479
enzymes in that bottle are even alive by

310
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,970
the time it makes it to us and it's hard

311
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,340
to know what's even in there

312
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,379
so you can make your own enzymes you can

313
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,879
make enzymes with a Bokashi bucket i've

314
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,159
talked about the Bokashi bucket before

315
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,019
some of that leachate stuff that comes

316
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,179
out that juice that terrible smelling

317
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,549
vomit poop smelled juice that comes out

318
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,709
that is loaded with enzymes there's a

319
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,569
lot of great stuff in there it's a good

320
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,660
portion of enzymes I've used that stuff

321
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,879
if you have a clogged drain the enzymes

322
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:55,730
in that boat Kashi bucket will dissolve

323
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,960
a funky clog in your drain so that tells

324
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,940
you about the enzymes that are in there

325
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,700
if you're gonna use that in your plants

326
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,740
use it very sparingly a very little bit

327
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,460
per gallon of water I put maybe an ounce

328
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,899
and a 25 gallon container of water so

329
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,550
you don't need a lot of that stuff but

330
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,049
you can make your own enzymes through

331
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,000
the Bou Kashi bucket they're just as

332
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,919
effective and they were basically free

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
and they're actually I think you're

334
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,069
making money doing that because you're

335
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,710
putting food scraps that would have gone

336
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,510
into the trash into the bowl Kashi

337
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,710
bucket so now you're making money

338
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,629
because you're not putting something

339
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,650
into the trash or reusing a product

340
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,179
you're turning it into something that

341
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,679
you're gonna feed your plants now you

342
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:32,509
and your plants are eating the same diet

343
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,949
it's gonna make you think a little more

344
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,389
about it and it's gonna make you take

345
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,770
better care of yourself and your plants

346
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,449
and it will encourage your dietary

347
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,590
decisions when you're shopping because

348
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,910
you'll go to buy something and you'll

349
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,160
say oh I can't put that in the bowl

350
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:45,289
Kashi bucket and he'll start eating more

351
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,059
raw healthy foods it'll be good for you

352
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,409
so it's a chain reaction when you

353
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,389
started loving the plants and realizing

354
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,370
what goes into these plants you say why

355
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,809
do I spend all the money on the best

356
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,759
nutrients but then I stop at [ __ ]

357
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,049
McDonald's and feed myself [ __ ] you're

358
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,149
gonna start feeding yourself the top

359
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,649
shelf nutrients also so let me figure

360
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,289
out where I was in this rant and we will

361
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,970
get back on this you can make your own

362
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,079
enzymes with the Bokashi bucket if

363
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,940
you're not familiar with the Bokashi

364
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,320
bucket it's really easy to find do some

365
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,820
simple research on that it will change

366
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,980
your growing life also another very good

367
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,320
use of bottled enzymes

368
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,240
is if you are going to recycle cocoa or

369
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,400
if you're going to recycle your soil I

370
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,590
highly recommend you mix up some water

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,090
and while that cocoa or that dirt is

372
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,350
still in the pot let's say you've

373
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,030
harvested the plants you've got that

374
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,980
little nub of a stick sticking out

375
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,449
you're gonna carry those pots off to

376
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,129
wherever and then that soil is gonna get

377
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,670
recycled if you don't have a container

378
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:40,820
to dump all of that soil into while it's

379
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:44,179
still in the grow room run a strong feed

380
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,330
of water and just enzymes through those

381
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:50,449
plants mix up if it says 2 mils per

382
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,889
gallon do 4 put 4 mils in there and just

383
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,509
water those plants till you get a bit of

384
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,519
a little bit of runoff there's no plants

385
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,319
in there it's just a pot with dirt in

386
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
there those enzymes are gonna get in

387
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,879
there if you plan on recycling that soil

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,110
or recycling that cocoa that's gonna get

389
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,580
in there and break down all the dead

390
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,990
[ __ ] all the leftover [ __ ] that you

391
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,670
don't want it's gonna clean that stuff

392
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,169
right out of there if you're gonna

393
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:10,669
combine it all together into a giant

394
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:13,490
container if you can do that

395
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:15,319
stir it up get it all combined then run

396
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,700
the enzyme water through there do that

397
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,440
but that's gonna be a much larger

398
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,940
container of water to deal with you're

399
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,390
gonna have a much larger mess you're

400
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,370
probably used to watering 9 or 10 3 or 5

401
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,899
gallon pots already so that's probably

402
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,210
easier for you to do so that's a good

403
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,500
way to recycle your soil now earlier I

404
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,009
mentioned that we were going to talk

405
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,629
about a test to determine which enzymes

406
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,279
are actually contained within the

407
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,350
bottles that we are purchasing I'm not

408
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,000
gonna talk about any branding because

409
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,180
that is up to you to do your shopping do

410
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,860
your research just buy quality enzymes I

411
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,959
don't know who to recommend right now

412
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,789
because I'm making mine with the Bokashi

413
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,889
bucket there are several brands out

414
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,599
there I'm not sure if you're getting

415
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,460
anything extra when you buy those really

416
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,200
expensive brands there may be selling

417
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,269
you the exact same thing as the lesser

418
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,770
costing brands I don't know what's in

419
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,789
there but we're gonna talk about a test

420
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:07,789
to determine what is in our enzyme

421
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:09,980
bottles now this test will tell us if

422
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:12,559
the enzymes we purchased are able to

423
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,500
break down cellulose and Hemi cellulose

424
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,349
which are two components of route

425
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,230
material now the first test pour some of

426
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,360
your enzymes into a small dish and

427
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,230
simply drop a small square of paper into

428
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,300
that dish

429
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,250
now the enzymes have to cover and coat

430
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,549
this little piece of paper now once that

431
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,500
happens if the

432
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:33,929
paper is destroyed and eaten up by the

433
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,789
enzymes that is proof positive that

434
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:39,000
there are enzymes in there that are able

435
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:41,069
to break down cellulose now the second

436
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,350
test will be done to determine the

437
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,790
presidents of hemi cellulose and i may

438
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,649
be saying that wrong if I'm saying hemi

439
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,389
cellulose wrong please do correct me so

440
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,129
that I can sound smart in the next

441
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,769
episode here's what you do

442
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:55,919
get some applesauce and pour some of

443
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,549
that enzyme product right into the

444
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,599
applesauce

445
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,039
don't pour into the whole jar you guys

446
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,570
get a little dish just a little

447
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,639
container of applesauce and pour some

448
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,050
beer your enzyme product into the

449
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,449
applesauce now if the apple sauce

450
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:08,099
becomes liquidy if it eats up the chunks

451
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,579
of apple and just makes it a liquid you

452
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,040
can see that there are enzymes in there

453
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,078
that are able to break up hemi cellulose

454
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,649
so you can visually assess that those

455
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,599
enzymes are there and working now this

456
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,059
may not work with all products and if it

457
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,730
doesn't work it does not mean there are

458
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,429
not enzymes in your product it just

459
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,889
means that cellulose and Hemi cellulose

460
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:33,929
are not present or active in the product

461
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,578
which you purchased now we talked about

462
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,319
it earlier there are many different

463
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:40,169
kinds of enzymes and each has its own

464
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,390
specific function or a specific target

465
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:45,479
now we also know that plants create

466
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,919
their own enzymes so if the brand of

467
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,350
enzymes you're purchasing doesn't

468
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,969
contain a specific enzyme don't be

469
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,800
afraid to get another product an

470
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,480
enzymatic product and back it up with

471
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,979
that one I don't think you can overdose

472
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
these plants with enzymes they'll all

473
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,000
balance each other out they'll all be

474
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,829
used for something if one isn't needed

475
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,450
another enzyme will probably destroy it

476
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:06,119
and turn it into something that is

477
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,860
needed for the plants at that time so

478
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,259
some products that are sold as enzymes

479
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,029
are not even enzymes but they're blends

480
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,740
of microbes and fungi

481
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,918
but when they work properly they will

482
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,599
populate and secrete the enzymes that we

483
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,429
need but that's only possible if the

484
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,588
microbes are still alive and they're

485
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,839
able to reproduce fast enough to be

486
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,759
useful and like I said earlier you don't

487
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,109
know what's in that bottle until you do

488
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,669
a test on your product yourself at home

489
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:35,129
alright you guys that was about 17

490
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:37,290
minutes worth of information on enzymes

491
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,929
again I'm not going to recommend an

492
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,909
enzyme product for you do your research

493
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,230
find the one that fits your budget there

494
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,350
are bottles of enzyme

495
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:49,589
all the way from $13.99 all the way up

496
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:51,569
to $399 for the same sized bottle so

497
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,308
don't get sticker shock do a little

498
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:55,259
research find out what's in there find

499
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:56,730
out what's gonna work for you once

500
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,638
you've selected a product I recommend

501
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,079
use either half or the regular

502
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:02,759
recommended dosage on the bottle if you

503
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,859
want if it says pour in 2 mils per

504
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,019
gallon try it out pour in 2 mils per

505
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,849
gallon you probably don't need that much

506
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,740
they want you to use extra so that you

507
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,480
will buy more but like I said earlier I

508
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,058
don't think we can OD the plants on

509
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,919
enzymes so if the bottle says mix 2

510
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,450
milliliters per gallon into your feed

511
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,190
solution just makes up your nutrients

512
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,710
like you normally would put your base

513
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,570
your [ __ ] micro your bloom boosters

514
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,579
put it all in there then add the

515
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,019
required amount of enzymes just go ahead

516
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,460
and pour that into your measuring

517
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,038
container drop it right into your

518
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,259
nutrient solution mix it up now adjust

519
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,759
your pH just like you normally would go

520
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,710
right down the day you started adding

521
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,450
enzymes to your mix and feed your plants

522
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,000
just like you normally would and now

523
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,860
start paying attention start seeing if

524
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,538
the plants are any more vigorous start

525
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,759
seeing if you get new root growth see if

526
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:49,440
you have more shoots see if your buds

527
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,839
are bigger just pay attention to this

528
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,100
grow and see if there's any noticeable

529
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,109
difference in the performance of your

530
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,939
plants or the potency or the harvest

531
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:58,288
weight just pay attention to what

532
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,288
changes when you start introducing

533
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:02,308
enzymes to your feeding schedule all

534
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,720
right you guys I know it was a short

535
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,819

640
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,529
packed with enough information to make

641
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,300
it worth putting out this short episode
