tradition that we start the podcast off

19
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,319
by letting our friends know what we are

20

dabbing on let's tell them what we just

21

stars on Fambrough jaw one of my

23

26
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,129
that's what we need for the show I've

27
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,340
learned lately that almost all of the

28
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:58,259
dads give me chatty energy I've been

29
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,329
playing with some stuff lately that is

30
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,619
just like an off switch for people at

31
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,570
least for people like me

32
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,209
I watched dab and Granny hit some nine

33
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,379
pound hammer today she was giddy she was

34
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,728
chatty she's talking about all the [ __ ]

35
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,589
she's got to do and she's like let's

36
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,510
take a dab Jeff and she hits the 9 pound

37
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,609
hammer and it was like somebody [ __ ]

38
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,600
hit the slow-motion button for about 30

39
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,159
seconds she was like bradbury bad boy I

40
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,259
was like damn I just watched you that

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,420
she said you never see granny sit back

42
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,189
in the chair and she just like sat back

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,159
in the chair and took a moment she goes

44
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:32,309
you know I got really high shaded like

45
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,650
really check herself readjust it happens

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,359
so she had to recalibrate so you guys we

47
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,920
are hitting the star dog fan bro show

48
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,828
from our friends at apothecary farms

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
dude how excited are you that apothecary

50
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,779
is 4.5 miles from my house probably a

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
similar distance from your place love it

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,478
it's uh it's wonderful it saves me so

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,368
much time the damn car one of my

54
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,078
favorite things just random [ __ ] that

55
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:58,500
happened is I walked out of apothecary a

56
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,149
few days ago and Mike was walking in as

57
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,769
I came around the claros I think that's

58
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,329
Jeff's car and before I had time to

59
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:04,649
really think about that thought anymore

60
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,239
he came walking out the door with this

61
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,890
purchase as I was going in to make my

62
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,568
ego smile on my face made a

63
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,009
recommendation as a hey bro make sure

64
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,568

65
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,098

apothecary they honestly nobody pays me

67
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,699
to talk about the concentrates I smoke

68
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,289
nobody gives me concentrates or helps me

69
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,359
out like that I just talk about what I

70

74
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:32,848
wallet on the other hand may not be as

75
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,890
excited yeah that 35 40 minute drive was

76
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:36,060
a nice deterrent yes is I don't want to

77
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,679
go do that I don't feel like driving up

78
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,920

84
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,250
a fun podcast Mike is here if you're a

85
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,229
regular listener in a previous episode I

86
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,019
think it was 2 episodes back I read some

87
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,909
iTunes customer reviews within those

88
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,219
reviews somebody stated that they did

89
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,620
not enjoy Mike's presence on the podcast

90
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,659
I politely told them how good of a

91
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,939
friend Mike is and how important I feel

92
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,139
Mike is to the cannabis community not

93
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,919
only to the show but to the entire

94
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,929
community

95
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,280
he's well-spoken he's an intelligent

96
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,840
dude I'm not just kissing his ass

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,879
because he's here but I wanted to say I

98
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,039
said it on a show I wanted to say it to

99
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,449
his face Mike I appreciate you on the

100
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,098
show if somebody doesn't like you bro

101
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,909
skip the [ __ ] episode cuz Mikey's

102
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,530
gonna be here

103
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,959
Mike's my bro Mike has been around

104
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,909
medical K he's not as outspoken as I am

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,219
in the same way but he has been an

106
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,590
activist and advocate a spokesperson a

107
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,500
role model since I've known him which

108
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,739
was around 2007 or 2008 he was doing it

109
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,359
before that I helped someone sign up for

110
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,909
the first time on the medical marijuana

111
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,219
registry back in 2006

112
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:51,900
there we go it's we spent like eight

113
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,459
months working to get a friend of mine

114
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,829
on the registry and we finally succeeded

115
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,189
you know six so I mean I've been doing

116
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,889
this a long time in my opinion Mike has

117
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,598
earned his spot not only on the show but

118
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,659
in the community and he should be

119
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,729
accepted and involved in this as much as

120
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,579
myself so I really appreciate that man

121
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,988
yeah yeah it's not just growers it's not

122
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,510
just breeders it's not just people with

123
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,000
a big mouth like me you make this [ __ ]

124
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,339
possible I don't go to the City Council

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,129
meetings as much as I should because I'm

126
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,810
pre judged by my appearance and it's a

127
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,219
big reason why more

128
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,139
one of the community is involved and

129
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,300
you're there you're speaking on behalf

130
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,620
of us and you come check with me you're

131
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,210
like hey they're gonna make new rules

132
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,819
what should we kind of work for and you

133
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:38,339
kind of get my opinion as a grower as a

134
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,480
heavy consumer where we're both heavy

135
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,349
consumers I'm gonna call you heavy

136
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,240
consumer

137
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,350
compared to most people but in our

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
circle you're one of the lighter

139
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,980
consumers but on a different way you're

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,790
much more involved in the medical

141
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,310
consumption side I'm more on the I don't

142
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,889
even the the hip trendy [ __ ] side of

143
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,290
cannabis I guess one of the things that

144
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,639
I mean cuz this is this is a free-form

145
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,400
show if y'all haven't picked up on that

146
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,350
yet if you were looking for the second

147
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,089
part of our the flowering series Jeff is

148
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,650
doing this is not gonna be that episode

149
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:09,449
that'll be Monday you guys stick in

150
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,099
months dice it stick in stick around

151
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,599
into him that's the same thing it sounds

152
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,870
gross when you say stick in I've

153
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,760
actually sent Sanjay Gupta a couple of

154
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,540
like really impassioned emails and

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,259
social media messages about this we need

156
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,470
a weed for focused on THC side of the

157
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:32,819
story somewhere over the last five six

158
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,750
years seven years we stopped thinking of

159
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:39,060
THC is highly medically active and

160
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,160
started thinking of it more as the fun

161
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,550
side while CBDs the medical side and

162
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,140
that's not at all true you use THC for a

163
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,180
number of medical components and now I

164
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,409
consider you both a medical and erech

165
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,720
user absolutely but yeah we THC has

166
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,720
medical applications millions and

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,650
millions of Americans and even more tens

168
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,100
of millions of people around the globe

169
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,019
use THC medically you're definitely one

170
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,700
of those people bro I don't take and

171
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,779
you're also a [ __ ] stoner like don't

172
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,228
let me take that away from you

173
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,668
guaranteed I say that my first two dads

174
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:13,079
those are medicinal that third and

175
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,569
fourth one those are purely recreational

176
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,759
dabs that that fifth and sixth one that

177
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,269
is just party time I know that there is

178
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,389
a limit

179
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,129
I do have I've got a traumatic brain

180
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,090
injury I've also got some other medical

181
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,199
things I don't even talk about because

182
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,129
honestly I don't think anybody cares

183
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
it's not what I'm here for

184
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,800
we got a stomach condition that really

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,210
[ __ ] me up sometimes it'll talk about

186
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,879
it but high limonene and high THC

187
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:38,638
strains work very well for my brain

188
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,379
injury sometimes it just feels like my

189
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,908
skips a little bit like my CD like

190
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,249
remember only had CDs that's a [ __ ]

191
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:46,110
old I am when your CDs get like just

192
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,150
every once in a while you just you just

193
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,979
know that on that one song that on come

194
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:53,188
as you are by Nirvana you're doing that

195
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:55,378
one course no I don't have a gun just

196
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,879
that one time there's jump my brain will

197
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,979
do that occasional I can't predict when

198
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,528
and where did I get those if I keep

199
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,930
enough limonene and THC in my brain it

200
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:05,490
doesn't do that it stops it and it

201
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,468
sounds crazy because you're like you're

202
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,990
putting THC in your brain to fix a skip

203
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,879
no it really puts the puzzle pieces back

204
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,098
together it lubricates my record player

205
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't know how to describe it but that

206
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:18,478
makes the well what we've learned about

207
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,908
the endocannabinoids system over the

208
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,339
last several years is that it maintains

209
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:25,139
homeostasis in your body that's what

210
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,179
that particular system does like your

211
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,340
skeletal system makes it so you're not a

212
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,430
[ __ ] blob of flesh on the floor your

213
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,448
vascular system moves blood around your

214
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,120
endocannabinoid system make sure that

215
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,468
all the other body systems are working

216
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,658
the way they're supposed to kind of

217
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:41,610
balance themselves out and that's why

218
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:43,829
cannabis has so many different medical

219
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,009
applications it's because it's it's not

220
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:49,438
affecting one one system or one part of

221
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,990
your body it's affecting the system that

222
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,968
governs everything except breathing in

223
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,259
our rate for the first time I wish this

224
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:57,149
shows a video show because when Mike

225
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,658
said skeletal system I started doing the

226
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:00,870
robot

227
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:03,838
yep I'm not sure why I can't help it

228
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,129
folks I talk with my hands and so I'll

229
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:06,810
start making shapes and [ __ ] to

230
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,520
elaborate my points and Jeff just looks

231
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,110
at me like dude no camera you can keep

232
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,818
going it'll come out though your mouth

233
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,990
will we'll make those shapes happen if

234
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,658
you keep doing it with your hands I get

235
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,149
it but yes the endocannabinoids system

236
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:19,620
is some I really think it does balance

237
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,370
things out it can I don't want to sound

238
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,139
like I know what I'm talking about

239
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,269
medically but I know it messes with

240
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,860
blood sugar it messes with hormones it

241
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,778
can balance and throw things out of

242
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,129
whack if things are already a little out

243
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:30,689
of whack it can make it worse it can

244
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,269
also dial things in it can exacerbate

245
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,579
and fix a lot of things but I'm sure

246
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,049
that it's like a little like a little

247
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,968
bondo for my dent bro

248
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,740
it just little divot in my brain and I

249
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,659
think that limonene and the THC just

250
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,490
smooths it over it just makes it not

251
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:47,159
skip so that my thoughts can complete

252
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,600
and you can you can see sometimes like

253
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,100
I'll be like [ __ ] water what are the

254
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,839
three words that are blank in my brain

255
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,149
let's let's take a couple dabs and

256
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,279
- dabs later just smooth as can be I can

257
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,499
do a little podcast and what cucumber

258
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:03,120
boat wire could do is it boat or bird

259
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:04,740
boat but you convert the wire points

260
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,179
away from my score if you guys know what

261
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,909
we're talking about you are a champ big

262
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,909
shot it's my buddy DB because I am DB

263
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,009
[Music]

264
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:18,599
[ __ ] us all spoiled yes I keep looking

265
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:21,028
down at the table and smiling big

266
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,339
because there's enough hash on this

267
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,850
table to keep us just roasted for like

268
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,550
most 12 hours I've been doing some

269
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,189
things in New Mexico business and

270
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,599
pleasure and when I'm down there I get

271
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,759
to go hang out at my friend's house I've

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,829
got friends in New Mexico right and I

273
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,749
get to see the New Mexico available

274
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:42,688
product and I'm not trying to mash

275
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:44,220
they're not I was gonna politely say I'm

276
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:47,429
not gonna bash New Mexico but they're

277
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:50,040
behind they're not quite up to us not

278
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:52,528
quite caught up to us on concentrate

279
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,480
tech so when I'm in New Mexico I've got

280
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,740
a I don't think I'm allowed to consume

281
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,289
in New Mexico because I'm not a patient

282
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,120
if I were to consume in New Mexico it

283
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:01,828
probably I wouldn't be a spoiled as I am

284
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,480
here so when I get back I look at the

285
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:05,250
table and I'm like oh I'm so spoiled

286
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,959
when I'm here dude and a couple of very

287
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,519
real ways we've been living in the

288
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,828
future for a while now that's the truth

289
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,269
when it comes to cannabis products that

290
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:16,558
are available the quality of those

291
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:18,750
products the glass that's available I'm

292
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:20,549
going to shout out Albuquerque and stand

293
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,110
up for Albuquerque when you say I'm not

294
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,969

an aunt of mine actually sent me a

314
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,879
message a little while ago and someone

315
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,009
she knows ended up in an anti pot

316
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,610
conference and then she was giving

317
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,250
literature

318
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,560
she sent me messages trying to convey

319
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,240
fact check it and I was laughing really

320
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,919
hard she was laughing hard right

321
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,070
I'm afraid to get pulled over with my

322
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,990
diamonds I'm not in a diamond container

323
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,899

324
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,490
series apothecary extracts it's got the

325
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,769
place on it and then when I bought this

326
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,659
it comes with a receipt they've thrown

327
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,549
receipt there's a video on YouTube you

328
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,939
can pull up where they throw some dude

329
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:36,719
in jail over a crispy cream frosting

330
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,160
flake like donut glaze it looks like

331
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,129
some liver and that's not like a

332
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:44,639
euphemism for a drug I'm talking about

333
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:46,470
the donut sugar frosting he had a couple

334
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,419
of flakes on his his format and they

335
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,820
racked him for crystal meth and he was

336
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,439
in jail for like four days yeah the

337
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,760
tests came the preliminaries came back

338
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,990
from the lab that was like no [ __ ]

339
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,100
that's frosting Wow yes so diamonds and

340
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,329
hashes [ __ ] I've been worried about that

341
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,860
since the beginning yeah how do I

342
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:04,078
explain to a cop but this is a refill

343
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,730
syringe for my vaporizer exactly well we

344
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,189
weren't at least a shatter we know a guy

345
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,778
who has a YouTube channel he goes by the

346
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,519
name I don't know if it's red banner or

347
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,470
red been because there's Brian Redman

348
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,179
who is a producer and a comedian who

349
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,980
used to work with Joe Rogan and then

350
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,189
there's Dan red ban is who I'm talking

351
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,110
about

352
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,610
he's a cannabis activist he had a

353
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,560
YouTube channel that was shut down I

354
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,629
don't know if it's back I fear of Dan

355
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,849
red band supporter big shout out to Dan

356
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,549
and red Ben but he was taken to jail

357
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,959
because he had a CBD syringe in his

358
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,208
vehicle and they thought it was heroin

359
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,828
and the amount of CBD that was in that

360
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,119
syringe looked like a [ __ ] lot of

361
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,799
heroin I guess I don't know how much

362
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,209
heroin is a serving I'm kind of glad I

363
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,729
don't know that I know about a lot of

364
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,198
things I'm right 99% ignorant to heroin

365
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,519
other than that's like illegal and bad

366
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:46,409
and you shoot it up I don't really know

367
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,240
a lot comes out of that good job yeah

368
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:49,350
that's a good thing that's a know all

369
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,028
the [ __ ] I learned on the street I don't

370
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,110
know much about a heroin which is kind

371
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,578
of cool with me but they took him to

372
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,959
jail thinking that that was heroin and

373
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,979
they went and test it and finally they

374
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,389
came back and they're like dude you

375
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,680
can't even have the remaining part that

376
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,470
we didn't test back they gave him back

377
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,659
his scent of his syringe and [ __ ] but

378
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,070
dude I love you Dan he's a [ __ ]

379
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,539
scrawny little white boy he has no

380
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,769
business in a jail you know what I mean

381
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,448
he's not a criminal he didn't he

382
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,100
wouldn't and doesn't do anything to go

383
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:13,078
to jail he moved here from another state

384
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,149
to avoid going to jail he wanted to

385
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,159
follow the rules I bet he was scared

386
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,328
[ __ ] [ __ ] lesbian in jail that's not

387
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,469
his environment

388
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:21,149
you're a criminal and you're breaking

389
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,069
the rules and you're a thug you expect

390
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,828
maybe I'll go to jail but Dan is not a

391
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:28,769
great he's not equipped for that you

392
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:30,328
didn't see that in life bro so yeah it

393
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,909
got him I've had that little more than

394
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:35,729
once that like when I come over here I

395
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:37,678
bring some hash and there's that drive

396
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,389
where I'm like yeah this might be

397
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,948
slightly difficult to explain it I'm

398
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,839
glad I still have it in the original

399
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:45,178
packaging with labels yeah yeah this

400
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,939
this diamond actually says diamonds and

401
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:49,948
it says the carat weight of the diamond

402
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:51,659
10 carat internally flawless diamond and

403
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:53,639
it's got the cannabinoid and stuff

404
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,230
written on it and it had a sticker that

405
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,579
had all the stuff right here but I took

406
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,220
that off cuz you can't open the damn jar

407
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,508
without it but and I had the original

408
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,610
packaging but yeah I don't want to go

409
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:05,759
any Bart this Giants looks like a big

410
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,519
old [ __ ] crack rock dude it seriously

411
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,220
does look at this thing like it's the

412
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,808
that's the one thing the anti-pop folks

413
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,480
have been harping on that I actually

414
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:17,578
kind of agree with is yeah some of the

415
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,548
new hash looks a little cracky it told

416
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:24,328
this is this freebase massive that's a

417
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:26,548
tube it looks like a diamond it's the

418
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:28,798
size you your top thumb joint and it

419
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,369
looks like a quartz crystal in a hippie

420
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:33,659
shop

421
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:35,249

00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,168
a junior mint I would say it's it's a

423
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,569
little bigger than it's almost - Junior

424
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,668
Mints crushed together the two that got

425
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:43,909
squished together yeah yeah the two -

426
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:47,298
Seth gummy bear it's a full gummy bear I

428
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:51,600
you're gonna be sitting in jail for a

429
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,428
few a few days while the cops test that

430
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,839
and confirm that it's THC and they're

431
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:56,009

from what I've learned but I still I

446
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,998

car they have a speed limit but dude I'm

448
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,778
not gonna talk about how fast I was

449
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:31,870
going when I passed three state troopers

450
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,059
and they didn't budge they

451
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,039

485
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,219
shoes I look like I smoked a pound of

486
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,659
[ __ ] weed everyday like it's obvious

487
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,830
when I and you can you can tell when you

488
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,990
talked to me that I'm definitely a

489
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,820
cannabis consumer Mike doesn't look like

490
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,200
that as much you've got a couple hints

491
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,520

492
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,890
hint that this guy may break some rules

493
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,958
when I'm on vacation depending on the

494
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:04,150

some factly exactly where I'm headed

497

with this cannabis consumers find each

498
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,568
other and cannabis sellers can find in

499
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:15,879

what country you're in

503
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,689

504
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,289
one gram in three and a half gram bags

505

over that person is trained to spot all

506
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,519
of the tell-tale signs for cannabis

507
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:32,170
consumers from all the different little

508
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,599
varieties that pass through their area

509
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,340
yeah I've never been somewhere or it was

510
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,639
hard for me to get hurt and this is

511
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:41,049
going back to like 98 you can remember

512

going to New York one time to visit

513
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:45,558

528
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,600
going on that night I could be turned

529
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,309
down maybe 30 different sale offers in

530
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,990
New Orleans in the ten days I was there

531
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:25,308
just let me know I was the same [ __ ] you

532
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,019
guys were smoking a minute ago down that

533
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:28,579
alley no not interested bro thanks

534
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,960
though I don't know how much plastic was

535
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:33,168
in it with a smell like a tire fire oh

536
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,778
man no oh man no I'm not worried about

537
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,580
it at all and it's like if you're a

538
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:40,278
longtime listener the show you know I'm

539
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:41,658
a tobacco consumer and caffeine consumer

540
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:45,138
and I'm heavily addicted to those two

541
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:47,749
things if I was facing a prospect of a

542
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:49,819
trip for 10 or 15 days where I couldn't

543
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:52,278
consume caffeine or I couldn't consume

544
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:55,189
nicotine I wouldn't be considering

545
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:56,960
taking that trip now I'm a hundred

546
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,009
percent comfortable with a 10 or 15 day

547
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
trip where there's just like there's

548
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:01,639
probably not gonna be any lead it's fine

549
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,009
it's a very different thing I'm worried

550
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:09,258
about my body pain that I'm treating

551
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:10,878
with THC and CBD not my head or being

552
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,440
able to sleep right there aren't

553
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:13,908
withdrawal symptoms when you don't have

554
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,710
now you might not be able to sleep I

555
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:17,389
find myself with extra energy because

556
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,889
cannabis obviously when you consume like

557
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:20,028
I do it's gonna wear you out a little

558
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,109
bit you're gonna be a little tired from

559
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:23,028
it by the end of the day so I don't

560
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:24,829
sleep as well if I don't consume as much

561
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:27,109
but I'm sure after 3 or 4 days that

562
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:30,019
would just wear right off but my palm

563
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:33,048
sweat like I have I have sticky palms

564
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:34,339
for like three days and it's just gone

565
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,710
it's like I'm nervous for three days

566
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,628
yeah just my palms though I just feel

567
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,889
nervous Alex just that balance is out of

568
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,959
balance and you're missing one of the

569
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,729
ingredients so if we were gonna take you

570
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,069
on a trip and I told you that you had to

571
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,538
go 14 day and 14 days you were gonna be

572
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,859
gone for 14 days you got two weeks to

573
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:51,980
prepare then you're gonna be gone for

574
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,808
two more weeks how many days before we

575
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,118
left on that trip would you need to

576
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:57,888
taper you can't smoke cigarettes

577
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:59,269
you can't consume cannabis and you

578
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:01,399
cannot drink

579
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,049
caffeine on this trip how many days

580
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,360
before we leave do you need to start

581
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:10,519
tapering off your use of those three

582
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:12,169
substances alright so just it's a it's

583
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,529
mandatory this is definitely happening

584
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:18,620
oh yeah and I'm gonna be gone for 14

585
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:22,720
days without you you've got to come on

586
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,719
this trip like your life is on the line

587
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,630
yeah head to the kids in the mix to

588
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:31,399
notice and both so there's like

589
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,040
nicotine's a hell of a drug like I can

590
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,110
quit caffeine in a couple of days and

591
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,279
I'm just a prick for like I'm

592
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,669
short-tempered and my I've got a

593
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,899
headache

594
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,140
I was gonna ask if you get the cafe

595
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,890
anything bad about 36 hours into a

596
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,750
caffeine purge what's the word I fast I

597
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,370
tried sometimes I'll just try to make it

598
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,140
a point about 36 hours and I'll feel it

599
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:54,259
I'd like oh there it is right behind the

600
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,750
eyes five hours after I'm awake oh well

601
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:59,869
I haven't consumed at least one

602
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,509
caffeinated beverage iced are you okay

603
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,489
when I was in Mexico the last time I was

604
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,559
just drinking the local coffee and it

605
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,769
wasn't keeping up with what I do with

606
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,179
Mountain Dew most days and there's not

607
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,859
all the other ingredients of Mountain

608
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,860
Dew in that coffee the us the caffeine

609
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:17,750
and there's not even as much caffeine so

610
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,519
I was having to pound the coffee but I

611
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,750
was able to stay ahead of it alright but

612
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,519
if we're talking about a trip where

613
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,140
there's none of that like either I'm

614
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,460
gonna kill everyone else on the trip on

615
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:31,820
day two or this is gonna take like major

616
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,319
like work prep support yeah chemicals

617
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:37,819
think about how many cigarettes you

618
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:41,029
smoke in a day and then that often I

619
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:43,250
can't taper if I'm smoking I smoke like

620
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,589
I smoked okay so we just gotta take your

621
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,150
cigarettes away yep so we got to do that

622
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:49,490
about five days before so you can get

623
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:55,160
over the [ __ ] phase you get about 14

624
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:57,769
hours before I break and that's a little

625
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,200
longer if like I smoke normally for the

626
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,000
day and then I go to bed and then sleep

627
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,309
for like a really long time like maybe

628
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,359
stay to bed for 10 hours I could

629
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,730
probably get up and go four or five

630
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,679
hours alright so you're getting to 15 16

631
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,269
hours tops before I'm like in a

632
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,950
homicidal I will [ __ ] kill you or you

633
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:14,660
get to nicotine rage I feel like we just

634
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,160
brought chad shank on the show and if

635
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,960
you know who chad shank is you're a cool

636
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,910
[ __ ] i don't know if you even

637
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,309
know whose but you just morphed into

638
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,420
chad shank and that's really it's it's a

639
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:28,069
real addiction like I remember being

640
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,420
much much younger a teenager and when I

641
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:32,149
just started smoking and I wasn't

642
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,700
addicted I remember that you you can

643
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,900
it's like consuming anything now like

644
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,910
everybody loves tacos

645
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,740
if you're forced to go two weeks without

646
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,170
tacos it's like not even something you

647
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,009
remember a month later you don't

648
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,080
remember that happening yeah that's is

649
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:49,789
so much different with nicotine dude

650
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,059
it's not even [ __ ] funny I've been in

651
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:55,940
three car accidents in my life two of

652
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,529
them are directly related to on the way

653
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,220
to acquire nicotine that I didn't have

654
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:04,129
like my focus was all about that next

655
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,490
dose of nicotine not on the car driving

656
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,360
behind me god damn it Mike so as your

657
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,740
friend you know that those are two

658
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,929
problems right you know that that's not

659
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,250
like no this is what's gonna kill me if

660
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,080
I'm the [ __ ] stop okay as long as

661
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,410
you're we're getting old and I'm

662
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,779
continuing I consume like how the [ __ ]

663
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,080
do you stop kidneys yeah I agree

664
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:25,369
quite often guys I said bottle bottle

665
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,779
bottles of water that's the hardest word

666
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:28,429
for my brain bottles of water on the

667
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,869
table and I offer them to Mike and

668
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,910
honestly he brawls his eyes I feel like

669
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:34,189
I'm [ __ ] [ __ ] for that plenty of

670
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,519
water is just it's I'm over here talking

671
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,650
to on the show I need something yeah

672
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,450
dude we saw Jay and Silent Bob do their

673
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,940
podcast and Jason used to blend like

674
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,850
[ __ ] for Red Bulls in 45 minutes yep

675
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,009
guy I don't know how you even this dude

676
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:51,099
that guy's brain is so primed for it it

677
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,809
needs constant feedback

678
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,909
he's just destroyed his dopamine loop oh

679
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,919
yes I've met more than one addict that's

680
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,660
like that that when they're they're out

681
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,720
in the world talking in chat and it's

682
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,240
they pound Red Bull like its water and

683
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,789
they chain smoke yeah and he couldn't

684
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,259
smoke in there so he just pound that and

685
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,359
you guys we're not spilling any beans

686
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:12,680
that Jason Mewes was a heroin addict

687
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,589
he's recovering addict that's part of

688
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,910
why he was very open about it so we're

689
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:19,159
not spilling anybody's beans that he's a

690
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,600
week in recovery still but the man just

691
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,390
pounds [ __ ] Red Bulls when he's

692
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:26,298
talking if you go see Jason Mewes and

693
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:28,399
Jay [ __ ] Duke

694
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,538
what's his real name Kevin Smith Smith

695
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:31,758
I'm gonna call him Bob I couldn't

696
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:33,019
[ __ ] Kevin Smith suddenly but if you

697
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,480
go see them pay attention to how many

698
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,769
[ __ ] Red Bulls Jason Mewes pounds so

699
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,210
we have set a good precedent we

700
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:41,329
understand how the caffeine and the

701
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,009
nicotine are a staple if we take those

702
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:44,418
away from you you said homicidal you're

703
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:46,278
gonna turn into Chad shank which is

704
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:47,990
really funny if you understand that now

705
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:49,999
let's shift our focus we have removed

706
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,829
your caffeine from you we have removed

707
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,360
the nicotine from you you're a raging

708
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:56,210
[ __ ] we know that you've got to get

709
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,918
on this flight now how far ahead of that

710
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,319
trip time do we have to start

711
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,778
eliminating cannabis from your diet so

712
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,269
to speak for it not to totally throw

713
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:08,089
your body into shock if we cut it off no

714
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,618
no time no time so hypothetically if you

715
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,269
weren't white Mike and you were down to

716
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:12,918
break some [ __ ] rules you could take

717
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:14,659
some dabs with me in the car as I drop

718
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,919
you off at the hypothetical trip that

719
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:18,830
I'm sending you on and it wouldn't

720
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,409
affect you move your body wouldn't start

721
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:23,778
having withdrawal symptoms or [ __ ] like

722
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:25,909
that all right so I think I mean that I

723
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:29,509
took the really long especially on this

724
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:31,999
trip that we're planning because we're

725
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,190
traveling to Europe so but the flights

726
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:36,079
[ __ ] up my sleep patterns as they're

727
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,240
substantially more than the lack of

728
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,480
cannabis oh yeah so I'm not even gonna

729
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,849
notice one of the only two symptoms I

730
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,980
feel at all because I'm gonna wood

731
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:49,368
tribute most of that symptom to the

732
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,139
jetlag all right and like it's gonna be

733
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:53,209
the end of March early April in Paris

734
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:55,368
like having sweaty palms ain't gonna be

735
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,308
a problem I'm wearing a hoodie anyway

736
00:25:55,368 --> 00:26:00,648
how long of a flight is that dude it's

737
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:05,628
like 10 or 12 14 hours damn think when I

738
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:10,069
went in mm it was like four or five

739
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:13,069
hours to DC and then 10 or 12 to Paris

740
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:16,278
in that last that second flight you

741
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:19,788
[ __ ] brutal yeah just brutal you just

742
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:21,950
fine that long yeah I got lucky I was in

743
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,808
the bulkhead so you get a little bit

744
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,519
extra you're the first row of seats

745
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:26,538
behind first-class okay like an extra

746
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,849
four inches of legroom

747
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:31,398
hell yeah hi dude every [ __ ] yatch

748
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,849
matters I'm six five and Mike's what 6-3

749
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:33,859
6-4

750
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,289
yep yeah and Mike's probably got a good

751
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:39,339
40 or 50 pounds on me

752
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:43,059
it hurts he says it's a seriously from

753
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:46,449
the my back hip bone like at the top of

754
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:49,329
my ass to my kneecap is exactly the same

755
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,460
length from the back of my seat that I'm

756
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:54,669
sitting in the airplane to the back of

757
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,920
the [ __ ] in front of my niece it's

758
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,870
flush against your armrest and my leg is

759
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,240
locked in their heart I was trying to

760
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:02,829
get on a ride at Six Flags and the girl

761
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,529
said put your legs down and I was like

762
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:07,750
[ __ ] what we're like what do you want

763
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:10,059
me to do with them at more than once

764
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,859
I've I've gone to to ride an amusement

765
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:15,250
ride like a roller coaster or some and

766
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:18,219
the carnies just like yeah you don't

767
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,730
you're too big like yep like I get this

768
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,289
you're only 17 but you don't fit too

769
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,250
tall the cage doesn't come down over

770
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:26,170
your shoulders anymore

771
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,329
uh-huh in its like weight you can build

772
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,680
it for 450 500 pound people but you

773
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:32,500
can't build it for people who are taller

774
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,269
than 6 foot what the [ __ ] alright so I

775
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,220
think I made my point if mike has to

776
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,589
eliminate the caffeine and the nicotine

777
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,299
from his diet he will become a homicidal

778
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:43,899
maniac which I think were his own words

779
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:46,240
so caffeine's not so bad but nicotine's

780
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,590
a different class of drug but if we took

781
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,009
away your cannabis you'd be just fine

782
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:52,659
just fine no withdrawals no craziness

783
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:54,309
just fine just fine me too

784
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,220
me too I wouldn't sleep for a day or two

785
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:59,470
I bet you just because I give a lot of

786
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,089
my energy to the end of the day energy

787
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,069
it calms me down that's how I just

788
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:05,379
mellow myself out but after a couple

789
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:06,789
days it's partly the ritual is what I

790
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,810
would miss the most just hanging out

791
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,789
with you you want to take a couple dabs

792
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:11,859
bro let's try this Clementine let's try

793
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,629
this whatever we got this Citroen Delic

794
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,679
sunset just try them all and sue a guy

795
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,390
you know it's just part of the fun but

796
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,360
think after a few days I'd be completely

797
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,400
okay with it alright now we'll be okay

798
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,990
and then if I'm on vacation

799
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
like you said you're going to Europe if

800
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,420
I was on vacation or something it

801
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,890
wouldn't give a [ __ ] I can look at all

802
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,240
the vacation I've got to see you don't

803
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,610
even need to be stoned for this you

804
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,049
could enjoy that when when I was in New

805
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,699
Orleans I didn't miss cannabis at all

806
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:36,159
and I kept running into it when I was in

807
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,950
Mexico I ran in a bad weed right away

808
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,529
and it wasn't worth trying to look to

809
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,390
find more but it was a kind of a

810
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:45,279
stressful trip and it was nice to be

811
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,460
able to go step away from everything for

812
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,240
15 minutes and just break up a little

813
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,220
[ __ ] piece of brick we'd empty out a

814
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,778
cigarette [ __ ] repackage couldn't

815
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,240
even get rolling paper stuff oh man

816
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:59,528
it was weird everywhere I'd go and try

817
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,700
to get papers they looked at me funny to

818
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:02,740
try to sell me switchers and I was like

819
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,480
no I don't want I want to I want to play

820
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,399
yeah but you said break up some brick

821
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,710
weed makes you humble right takes you

822
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:14,798
back to those days the people that gave

823
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,798
it to me were so like they were so

824
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,388
excited they knew I was coming in and in

825
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,128
the next day they wanted to have some

826
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:22,658
weed ready for me they found some dude

827
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:24,519
that was gonna sell them weed they sold

828
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:27,009
them but way more weed than they were

829
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,509
expecting like they gave them enough

830
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:30,999
money for a decent amount of like

831
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:33,759
regular American but oh yeah and they

832
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:35,470
got its equivalent in maxi break yeah

833
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,990
know what to do with this take an ounce

834
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,700
and a half and I'm like days but

835
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,109
whatever yeah and it was nice to be able

836
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,149
to step away and just have that rich

837
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:46,359
will break it up clean it up roll it up

838
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:48,368
but it was more get away from everybody

839
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:52,058
and just let my own thoughts simmer for

840
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:55,028
15 minutes rather than consuming THC an

841
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:56,079
