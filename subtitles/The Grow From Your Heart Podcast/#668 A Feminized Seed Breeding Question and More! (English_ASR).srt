71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,120
recording on august 27 and today

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
the plants are going crazy most of the

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,719
plants are kicking into the flowering

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,719
phase they're starting to make big fuzzy

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,719

77
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
most of them are kicking off there were

78
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,280
a couple of strains however that are

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
lagging a little bit they're just

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,840
stretching like crazy right now i'm sure

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
they'll catch up but it is an exciting

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
time for the greenhouse grow it was fun

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
to be out there getting my shoes dirty

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
getting a sunburn great time loving the

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,280
greenhouse life that was a lot of fun

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
let's keep moving uh some people were

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,439
asking me to do some episodes about

88
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
things that i have already done the

89
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,039
outdoor season is happening uh every

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
outdoor season i get asked for a couple

91
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,239
of outdoor episodes and then toward the

92
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,560
end of the season i get asked for a

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
couple of very specific episodes i've

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,199
already done those episodes that i have

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,039
in my mind a couple of them i've only

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,598
done an audio form i haven't done them

97

don't forget about the old episodes is

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,200
what i'm trying to say we're at 668

110
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,039
right now that means there are 667 other

111
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
episodes that may have some answers that

112
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,400
you haven't heard yet

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,719
and even though i have done a lot of

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,879
episodes that i haven't converted to

115
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,799
video format yet or redone in the video

116
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,560
format i will get to those i was trying

117
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,640
not to repeat myself too much but it is

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,318
time i've got to kind of re-loop around

119
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,478
and do some of those old episodes over

120
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,879
again i've learned a lot technology

121
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,199
technology has changed uh the growing

122
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,120
has evolved so it may be time to update

123
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
some of those older episodes but don't

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
forget to check the feed uh do a quick

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,759
google search you may find an episode

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
about the question you've got in mind so

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
don't forget about that old stuff let's

128
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,679
move forward i do have a screenshot on

129
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,519
my phone somebody sent me a question i

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
just took a quick screenshot was the

131
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,120
most efficient way to do it this

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
question came from our friend i don't

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
know if they want their name said we're

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
gonna skip that the question says what's

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
up rasta jeff i've got a quick question

136
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,519
in your opinion is the hella dank seed

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,319
company a legit seed bank do they carry

138
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,599
legit irie genetics the answer to that

139
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,000
is yes the hella dank seed company is a

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
legitimate vendor for ire genetics that

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,439
is a great seed vendor a great seed bank

142
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,119
a great seed company

143
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,399
they get stuff out to you quite quickly

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
they've got a good selection a good

145
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,719
variety and good fair pricing i do

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
support them endorse them

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
promote them they are part of the team

148
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,478
most of the time you can verify a vendor

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
by checking my website

150
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,279
i usually have most of the vendors

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,759
updated on the website sometimes

152
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,599
i'm still auditioning a vendor so i may

153
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
not add them right away

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,879
but once they do uh they do sell a few

155
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,319
packs and make a couple of orders and

156
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,439
they show me that they have good quality

157
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,240
customer service and they don't

158
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,240
embarrass me in any way or frustrate my

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
customers then i do add them to the

160
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
website there are probably one or two

161
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,839
maybe three that need to be added to the

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,759
website right now uh i just haven't uh

163
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,198
sent them to the web guy to do it as

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,879
soon as i send him an email he'll

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639

approval can change everything yeah i

250
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,958

252

know how you feel brother welcome to the

274
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,278
club thanks for joining us uh it says uh

275
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,278
it is therapeutic for me it is the most

276
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,039
therapeutic uh growing it is more

277
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,360
therapeutic than smoking cannabis in my

278
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,919
opinion it says my question is a little

279
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,800
different and i like different questions

280
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:42,000
it says how do you manage the personal

281
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,838
aspect of this process i mean socially

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
when you meet somebody new how do you

283
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
introduce this into the conversation it

284
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,720
is legal for me and i have 10 of your

285
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,519
strains and i'm debating which one to

286
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,278
pop in my next run that's a ramble but

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
if it's a commitment to grow this plant

288
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
properly and i don't want but it is a

289
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,039
commitment to grow the plant properly

290
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,199
and i don't want to have to constantly

291
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,278
come up with excuses i'm just curious

292
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
what your thoughts may

293
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,278
be

294
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,559
well

295
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,240
there's a couple of ways to go about

296
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,719
that it seems like the question is how

297
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
do you bring up cannabis in your uh

298
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
conversations in your social circle and

299
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,039
then also how do you bring up that you

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,159
grow cannabis in your social circle

301
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,240
right now

302
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,559
the best bet is to just not talk about

303
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,720
it keep your mouth shut uh feel it feel

304
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,319
things out check the temperature see how

305
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
people are see what the climate's like

306
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,959
where you are um

307
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,799
maybe ask some baited questions don't be

308
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,399
too obvious don't get yourself set up

309
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,919
for anything but maybe when you're in

310
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
your social circle when you're in your

311
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,360
group be like you see they legalized

312
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
weed and you're gonna get answers from

313
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
people that's all you have to do is

314
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
bring it up or just be somewhere and let

315
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
them bring it up if you don't want to

316
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
spark that conversation that's funny

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,919
spark that conversation that was not on

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,759
purpose if you don't want to spark that

319
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,000
conversation let them bring it up

320
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,759
they'll talk about it potheads love to

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
talk about pot you love to talk about

322
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,159
pot so much you're emailing me to talk

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,759
about pot to ask about how to talk about

324
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,439
pot so someone's going to bring it up

325
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,159
dude don't worry somebody will bring it

326
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
up

327
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,559
maybe you don't want to be that guy

328
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,799
you're

329
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,119
growing you're producing you've got some

330
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,679
stuff to lose don't tell people that you

331
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,679
don't know trust and probably love don't

332
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,359
even tell people that you're growing

333
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,120
there's no need for people to know that

334
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
you're growing even if it is legal it's

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
still a profitable profitable commodity

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,200
it's still a lot of work

337
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
people may want to steal it from you

338
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
people may want to just [ __ ] with you

339
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,719
just because maybe they don't like you

340
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
from high school still and now they know

341
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
you grow weed they want to make [ __ ] go

342
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
wrong because they don't like you and

343
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,079
they don't like weed now you're a target

344
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,839
be careful don't tell anybody that you

345
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,479
don't need to tell if they don't know

346
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,160
it's there they don't know it's there uh

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,039
yeah if that's the bottom line if they

348
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,078
don't know it's there they don't know

349
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,240
it's there if they don't know what's up

350
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,359
they can't do anything about it so

351
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
there's gonna be two different

352
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
boundaries here who are you going to

353
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,920
talk about uh there may be three

354
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
different boundaries who do we talk

355
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,599
about cannabis with who do we get

356
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040

360
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,838
we're going to have another layer of

361
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,359
people who do we actually smoke with

362
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,959
like because that's going to come up

363
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
once they start saying hey do you see

364
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,078

365

367
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,720

don't don't say around everybody like

369
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
we'll go smoke later bro save that wait

370
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,159
until you break off into your own little

371
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,679
groups or something and those people

372
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,120
that don't smoke or they were not with

373
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,719
the right ideas with you when they walk

374
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,399
away then stick around and be like hey

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,278
tell anybody that doesn't need to know

380
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,559

381
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,720

you going to share the grow with uh

384
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,039
everybody knows i grow because of who i

385
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,719
am and where i am and how uh what i've

386
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,240
been for this community that sounded

387
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
really egotistical what i've been for

388
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,720
this community uh how outspoken i have

389
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,399
been for this community i had uh i was

390
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
involved in the first dispensary in my

391
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
city i've been on the news smoking weed

392
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,320
news cameras have been at the [ __ ]

393
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,759
house where we smoked and [ __ ] uh people

394
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
know who i am and what i do that's why

395
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,838
i've got to follow the damn rules so

396
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,360
closely now but uh i kind of wish i

397
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
wasn't under the spotlight so much

398
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
sometimes uh under the magnifying glass

399
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,399
because

400
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
i will be a very good example if i need

401
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,360
to be so i've got to follow the rules

402
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,120
very carefully

403
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
so don't make it known that you're

404
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,078
growing unless you need to

405
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,000
don't tell i don't know if you're

406
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,679
married single got kids if you got a dog

407
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,799
my advice right now is just tell the dog

408
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,719
the dog's the only one that needs to

409
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,479
know you and the dog that's that's such

410
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
the greatest secret that you've got

411
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
maybe you're gonna make friends with

412
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,958
somebody who's really super cool and one

413
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
day you'll feel like it's time to share

414
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,518
that garden but

415
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,919
let that be like your secret zen thing

416
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
that you've got that's your new your new

417
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,599
secret just your new little zone in

418
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
there when i was growing illegally

419
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
before growing was fully legal it was

420
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,759
kind of like my little thing like i was

421
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,198
like yeah i'm in here doing this and

422
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,720
nobody can know about it's kind of fun

423
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,278
to have a little private project a

424
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,560
little secret thing um

425
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,958
if you have to make excuses

426
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,879
uh who are you making excuses to are you

427
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,119
making excuses to go burn one are you

428
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,879
making excuses because you've got to go

429
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,198
water that's one of the struggles of

430
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,559
being a grower is having to sneak away

431
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,879
like i got to go check on my [ __ ]

432
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,479
plants like here in colorado we look at

433
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,240
our phone and we say oh my pulse monitor

434
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
went off excuse me i've got to go take

435
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,278
care of my plants that's my way out of a

436
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,599
conversation or out of a boring

437
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,198
situation you're gonna have to find the

438
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
opposite you're like oh [ __ ] my plants

439
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,399
have an issue i gotta figure out how to

440
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,559
get out of here you're like my dog just

441
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
called me i gotta go take care of my dog

442
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,879
um excuses are gonna be harder to find

443
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,959
but be creative try to take care of the

444
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,039
plants uh early in the morning before

445
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,719
everybody else is up before work so you

446
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,559
can get in there take care of those

447
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
plants nobody will interrupt you uh

448
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,000
nobody's trying to get your attention

449
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,278
you're not uh cutting out of other time

450
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,360
when people think you should be

451
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,958
somewhere else uh but if you got to do

452
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
too much sneaky [ __ ] that's when you got

453
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,518
to kind of think about what you're doing

454
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
also

455
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
so

456
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,078
coming up with excuses mainly just keep

457
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
your mouth shut bro there's no need to

458
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,919
tell everybody about it not even your

459
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,359
girlfriend not your best friends what

460
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,439
happens if you and that girl break up

461
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,278
and she knows that girl is there she may

462
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,480
cause some problems for you

463
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,879
that could be a big deal what if you

464
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,879
tell your bro and one day he decides

465
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,278
he's not your bro anymore

466
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,759
like [ __ ] goes wrong man so be careful

467
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,399
um you're my age you got some years on

468
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,480
you i'm 42 as well uh so maybe hopefully

469
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,639
you got some wisdom by now hopefully you

470
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
got a good group of friends maybe a

471
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,519
trusty friend circle but still

472
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,198
these types of things change circles and

473
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,120
it's a new market where you are there so

474
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,958
be very very careful be very careful um

475
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,320
man and maybe uh you maybe want to get

476
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,919
in on the ground floor of these new

477
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
businesses you sound like a smart person

478
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,159
and you're growing and you need people

479
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,079
to talk to i just got the idea open up a

480
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,278
social smoking club or a dispensary

481
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,439
that's for you brother that's where you

482
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,198
meet all kinds of people to talk to and

483
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
that's also how you make a business out

484
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,399
of something you love and then it gets

485
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,159
legal and then you don't even have to

486
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,159
explain it to people they'll go that's

487
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,600
the guy with the dispensary downtown and

488
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,879
they'll be providing a service that

489
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
makes you feel good that you're

490
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,000
passionate about and that's what life is

491
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,360
all about that came to me at the end of

492
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
that message i'm glad i let that one

493
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
come through me all right uh bro thank

494
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
you for the great message i hope i

495
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,359
answered that question uh how do i

496
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,838
handle the social aspect of this uh let

497
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,199
it evolve naturally and mostly to keep

498
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
your mouth shut don't tell too many

499
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,879
people because um it's fun to smoke with

500
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,399
other people but it sounds like you've

501
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,838
been smoking by yourself for a long time

502
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
and that you can keep doing that bro and

503
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,320
tell somebody until somebody else admits

504
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
that they're a smoker then bring them in

505
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,160
uh kyle thank you brother it's a great

506
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,320
message i look forward to uh taking a

507
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,639
fat dab with you someday all right man

508
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,480
let's move on to the next message this

509
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,560
one came from a friend who is calling

510
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
themselves trike man i don't know that

511
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,719
if i ever that i've ever met trikeman

512
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,199
before sounds like a super cool

513
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
superhero name uh big shout out to trike

514
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,439
man i'm trying to picture your superhero

515
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,600
costume it's definitely sticky

516
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
it gets amber as you get [ __ ] angry

517
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,278
or super powered starts off clear and

518
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,278
your power builds up and starts getting

519
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,759
amber that's what trike man would do in

520
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,519
my mind i told you i took some dabs and

521
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,318
i'm high all right let's read this

522
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,599
message it says i hope all is well buddy

523
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,279
obviously things are well bro it's a

524
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,359
little bit warm other than that things

525
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,918
are ivory it says big ups to the irie

526
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,678
army it's trikeman here and i got a

527
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,240
little question about stabilizing

528
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,160
genetics with reversing females

529
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,679
that is a great topic sounds like a big

530
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
mouthful but it's really not that much

531
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,559
to think about uh stabilizing genetics

532
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
uh basically the goal i think when you

533
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,558
are talking about stabilizing is growing

534
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,679
a population of seeds and hoping that

535
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,960
they come out uniform they look the same

536
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,960
that's what i think you're saying when

537
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,360
you say stabilizing genetics and then

538
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,679
with reversing females so that is taking

539
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,119
a female plant and using silver

540
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,600
thiosulfate or

541
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,519
colloidal silver to induce that plant to

542
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,678
create pollen sacs and then pollinating

543
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,279
female plants with that which i do like

544
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,600
the idea that is a very good way to

545
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,639
stabilize and lock in traits without

546
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,959
opening up pandora's box

547
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,160
says so here's a little example of what

548
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,000
i am curious about say i start by making

549
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,038
my cross with a male and a female all

550
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,038
right we've got a plant uh next i search

551
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,960
for what my goal in that breeding

552
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,640
project was all right so we've got the

553
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
phenotype that was our goal that's

554
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,360
beautiful then from there i want to

555
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
reverse that female that i selected and

556
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,759
breed that to itself

557
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,080
that so now we've made a plant that is

558
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,679
beautiful this is a very common thing we

559
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,000
made some seeds we found a plant that's

560
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,759
beautiful now our friend wants to

561
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,599
take two clones of this plant so we're

562
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,519
basically going to cut a branch here and

563
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,678
a branch here and we got two cuts of the

564
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,279
same plant we're going to reverse one

565
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,280
using the reversal method that i've

566
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,000
talked about in previous episodes either

567
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,440
silver thiosulfate or colloidal silver

568
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,519
then we're going to put the pollen that

569
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
comes from that plant onto the other

570
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,960
plant so we've just reversed one

571
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,240
pollinated one we have now made an s1 or

572
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,919
maybe a feminized f1 some people may say

573
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,599
we're going to talk about that in depth

574
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,640
in the future here maybe get some other

575
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:08,079
folks on the show but i digress so um

576
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
i'm going to catch up in the message

577
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,839
search for what my goal was uh from

578
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
there i want to reverse that female and

579
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,720
breed it to itself makes perfect sense

580
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,080
so far my question is do i breed the

581
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,759
next generation to the first generation

582
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,639
i reverse the first time or do i reverse

583
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,359
the next generation and cross it to a

584
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,000
clone of itself again and keep doing

585
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,639
that or keep reading the next generation

586
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,038
to the first female i selected and

587
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,120
reversed uh thank you for everything you

588
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,000
do buddy i hope you feel irie about the

589
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,159
rest of your days respect from trikeman

590
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,480
big respect bro this is a great question

591
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,000
i've got a couple of good answers my

592
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
first answer is

593
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,440
yes

594
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,880
do all that [ __ ] do all of it um

595
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
that's how you're gonna find what works

596
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
the best is do all of that now i do have

597
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
some more in-depth answers to this

598
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,678
because i know you want more details

599
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,279
uh you want to

600
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,519
you want to continue breeding with this

601
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,519
now

602
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,158
excuse all the thrill clearing i've been

603
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
talking about those dabs now we're at

604
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,039
the phase where they [ __ ] up my throat

605
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,600
so what you've got is a feminized f1 or

606
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,158
it's an s1 because it's been self uh

607
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:21,199
that is going to be fairly uniform or

608
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,200
fairly stable in my experience

609
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,038
if you've selected good plants or a good

610
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
plant is what this would be

611
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,200
you're probably going to get

612
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,079
approximately 50 to 70 percent of your

613
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
plants that look like your starter plant

614
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,399
and then

615
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,359
probably

616
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
50 is a possibility but 50 to 30 of

617
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,119
those plants are going to look a little

618
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
bit like the mother that was used to

619
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,719
make that plant and the father that was

620
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
used to make that plant so you're gonna

621
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,600
have a pretty good lock in already on

622
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,840
your first cross when we uh start doing

623
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,199
the next cross is when we kind of unlock

624
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,599
weird [ __ ] sometimes we get um

625
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
f2 variation is when you start seeing

626
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,319
weird things when you do breeding so you

627
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,279
do the f1 you get that hybrid vigor uh

628
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,038
you do the f2 sometimes you'll find uh

629
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,918
plants that outperform the original

630
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,440
cross you find good parent stock from f2

631
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
and make the f3 and that's when you

632
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
really start locking in those uh the

633
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
stability those traits that you're

634
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
looking for uh the uniformity is what

635
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,038
the word i think i was looking for so

636
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,759
you may open up pandora's box and make

637
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,960
[ __ ] go weird by doing more breeding to

638
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,960
this uh reversed f1 or this s1 that

639
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,360
you've got so you do have two very

640
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
useful very viable options uh that you

641
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,119
could have great success with you could

642
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,480
either take uh two of those s ones or

643
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,239
it's an f1 yeah it's a self f1 uh we're

644
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,319
still debating on the names of and the

645
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,919
lettering and labeling of all this uh so

646
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,279
you could take a batch of those seeds

647
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,919
and grow them and find a male and a

648
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,359
female or i guess find an ideal female

649
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
in there or you could find an idea of

650
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
two females and you could cross that

651
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,960
however you'd like you could find one

652
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,960
and resell fit or you can find

653
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
two and cross those together and make

654
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,120
the next generation however you'd like

655
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
or you can do that back cross you can

656
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,000
take

657
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
something from the second generation and

658
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,038
put it back to that first generation you

659
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
made or back to one of those parents now

660
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,319
here is something that i don't talk

661
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,519
about a lot but here's something i

662
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,879
discovered on accident i took a plant

663
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,400
and it was a beautiful plant it was

664
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,159
amazing i loved it it was everything i

665
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,240
was looking for in a plant

666
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,720
i reversed it i made feminized uh f1s or

667
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,279
s1s out of that plant so i've got my

668
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,038
feminized seed stock and i did sort of

669
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,879
what you're thinking about doing i found

670
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,158
the winner out of that number nine was

671
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,760
the keeper

672
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
i took number nine

673
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,879
and then i took the original pollen from

674
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,519
the first making of that seed and i

675
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,840
pollinated number nine with the pollen

676
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,839
from its mom so that reversed pollen

677
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,519
went on number nine it was basically the

678
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,199
mom went on to the daughter essentially

679
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,000
and the offspring that came from that

680
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,279
were labeled number 77 uh the good one

681
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,519
my favorite one that came out of that

682
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,319
was labeled number 77 i was calling the

683
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,759
whole batch the 77s uh that was related

684
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,639
to some other stuff is why i got that

685
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,400
number

686
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
and if you know why big shout out hey

687
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,360
now um

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,440
so number 77 would not reverse so

689
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,158
depending on what your goal is if you

690
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,400
want to keep moving forward you may be

691
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,799
stuck because i can't breed i couldn't

692
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
breed with 77 for a long time because it

693
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,798
wouldn't turn around i could not reverse

694
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,960
it to make pollen from it so i feel like

695
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,879
i trapped myself i cut off my breeding

696
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
project right there the way that i did

697
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
that i'll repeat that process because i

698
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,080
probably got your attention more now

699
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,719
i made the feminized cross just like you

700
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,199
did i took a plant took two clones uh

701
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,679
pollen and pollen receiver that made

702
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,519
seeds i took a seed from that batch and

703
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,360
i found a stellar keeper that looked a

704
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,000
lot like the original plant i started

705
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,959
with i took the pollen from the original

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,798
mom and put that onto the daughter plant

707
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
and the offspring the granddaughters

708
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,639
that came out that'd be mommy daughter

709
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,960
granddaughter at that point right the

710
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
granddaughters don't reverse i can't

711
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
flip them they don't if i spray them

712
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,639
with silver thiosulfate they don't react

713
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,360
the way that most plants react i feel

714
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,278
like i really locked in the uh feminized

715
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,959
side of that plant to where i can't even

716
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,599
get it to reverse now that's how

717
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
stubbornly feminized that plan is so be

718
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,959
careful you may

719
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,240
trap yourself you may end your breeding

720
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
right there you'll have to go backwards

721
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,400
you'll say well i can't reverse this

722
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,480
thing it won't flip uh you can you can

723
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
do all of these ways that you want to do

724
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,240
it it depends on the traits that you're

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,319
searching for um are the traits that

726
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,359
you're looking for so you've made the s1

727
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,599
or the feminized f1 are the traits

728
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,119
you're looking for showing uh very

729
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,119
commonly are they prominent are they

730
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,278
dominant are they popping up a lot so

731
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,879
deciding the next move is all about

732
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,038
where are the traits that you're looking

733
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
for do you see the trait you're looking

734
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,278
for in a lot of the seeds you've got

735
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,959
do you see the trait you're looking for

736
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,079
and the mother plant that you started

737
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
with do you see the traits you're

738
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,000
looking for maybe in the father plant

739
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,558
that was the original pollen donor in

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
the original non-feminized cross

741
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,639
what where is the trait what are you

742
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
looking for get that trait get that

743
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,240
ingredient and then breathe that

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,400
direction i wish i had a better uh more

745
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,319
solid answer but i don't know

746
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
which plants look the best and which

747
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,399
plants have your goal but that is the

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,720
plant you need um

749
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,880
you are on the right track you've got a

750
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,558
lot of good ideas and i know i said it

751
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,559
earlier the answer is yes and the answer

752
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,079
is to do all of this

753
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,440
it's really hard to decide what to do

754
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,558
sometimes i'm going to read it again and

755
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
see if i can give you a better

756
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,720
definitive answer but without looking at

757
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,559
the plants and without saying

758
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,400
this one's got that strawberry terp that

759
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,639
i'm after or this one's got that purple

760
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,038
color that i'm after it's hard to pick

761
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,360
for you but go for the plants that have

762
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,839
the traits which you were looking for

763
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,240
and then keep locking in that trait uh

764
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,759
and then deciding so yeah if you want to

765
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,319
move forward with the feminized

766
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,158
generations or go back to another plant

767
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,000
it where are the ingredients that you

768
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,000
need are they forward are they back

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,919
there somewhere do the seeds show you

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,759
what you want or do you need to put

771
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,759
another ingredient in there the only way

772
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,759
to figure it out really honestly is to

773
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,960
breed it and grow them i'm going to scan

774
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,798
over the message real quick and make

775
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,319
sure that i got the answer to this all

776
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,918
right i think i more than covered the

777
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,678
answer to this question

778
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,759
it's all about finding where the traits

779
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,640
are that you want to lock in and then

780
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,480
use those plants to create the results

781
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,600
that you want i think you'd find great

782
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,079
results in the s2 generation i also

783
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,839
think you'd find great results in the uh

784
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,439
it would be a reversed back cross i

785
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,158
think you'd find great results in both

786
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,919
of those it's all about your goal uh

787
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,919
play with both of them if you can

788
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,960
honestly you're going to have great

789
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,159
results with that very first feminized

790
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,400
cross that's when you're going to see

791
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,159
great results it's not going to be

792
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
wonky or problematic or anything like

793
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
that you're not going to find a bunch of

794
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,119
mutants unless unless your starting

795
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,839
plants were wonky and mutants but i

796
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,278
think uh you sound like a smart guy

797
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,720
it sounds like you probably did good

798
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,640
selection it sounds like you're thinking

799
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,120
ahead which is very great because a lot

800
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,559
of breeders don't do that but i think

801
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,359
you're on the right path

802
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,798
and i think uh it's just the plants are

803
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,959
gonna tell you man i wish i had a better

804
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,400
answer i wish i could tell you do uh

805
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,079
three shakes of this ingredient three

806
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
shakes of this and it'll work but it's

807
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,000
all about seeing those plants which way

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
do you need to go what are the plants

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,159
showing you what are the parents showing

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,398
you grow it all out see what you've got

811
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,520
get very familiar with all of the plants

812
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,359
and then you'll know what they're going

813
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,759
to do you'll just be able to tell like

814
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,599
if you grow this this female plant so

815
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,278
many times and this female plant so many

816
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,798
times and you cross this one to this one

817
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,278
and this one to this one and that one to

818
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,359
that one you'll start knowing what this

819
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,798
plant contributes to crosses and you'll

820
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,918
start being able to predict it it's

821
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,679
almost it almost becomes uh predictable

822
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,159
once you've bred with a bunch of plants
