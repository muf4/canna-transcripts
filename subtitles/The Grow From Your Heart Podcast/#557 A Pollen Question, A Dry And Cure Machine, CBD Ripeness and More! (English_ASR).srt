at seeds here now dot com

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,959
if i like to start this podcast off by

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,359
talking about what i'm smoking

35
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,000
today i've been taking dabs of honey

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,840
banana

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,519
full spectrum extract from green dot

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
labs this is a blend of

39
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,078
banana og and honey boo-boo on the

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,640
package the flavor is described as

41
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,359
frosted banana pastry i think i agree

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
with that

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,280
but when i first cracked the jar open

44
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
the first aroma to hit my nose

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
made me think of a banana liqueur i

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,319
don't know that i've ever had a banana

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
liqueur but that's what it smelled like

48
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,279
to me

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,640
almost maybe a bananas foster it smells

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
like it may have some ice cream or

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,599
something sweet to it

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
but then when i dab it that liqueur

53
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,239
flavor some of the sweetness goes away

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
and that banana pastry is dominant in

55
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,759
the flavor

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
it is also really heavy this stuff made

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,959
me sit down and chill the [ __ ] out for a

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,478
couple of minutes

59
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,359
on the back of the package it says it

60
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,878
contains 73.07

61
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,759
thc and non-detectable amounts of cbd

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,878
i really enjoy the honey banana full

63
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,840
spectrum extract

64
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560

at tonto's underscore garden on

170
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,918
instagram check out his grow see what

171
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,319
he's got going on

172
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,319
it goes on to say i am just about

173
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,680
finished going through my first round

174
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,918
seeds and strains

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,879
i'm interested in crossing or keeping

176
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,319
for the future oh

177
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,000
i read that as a weird rhythm but it

178
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,360
says i'm just about finished going

179
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,959
through my first round of seeds and

180
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,879
strains that i'm interested in crossing

181
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,319
or keeping for the future that's better

182
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,079
then it goes on to say i was thinking

183
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,240
about reversing them

184
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,159
one by one to self-pollinate and then

185
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,439
also pollinate the other strains

186
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,600
i have in with it in my flower tent

187
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
so tonto basically wants to reverse a

188
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
plant and make some seeds for

189
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,319
preservation

190
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,478
my question is how would you recommend i

191
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,719
clean my flowering area after to be sure

192
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,680
no pollen is left over from the previous

193
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
run before

194
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,120
starting the next cycle does pollen go

195
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
bad after a certain time

196
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,879
if left in an open environment this is

197
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,679
part of my growing journey that is brand

198
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,000
new

199
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
but it won't be starting until sometime

200
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
in the fall

201
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
then he signs it with thanks for all you

202
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
do you are greatly appreciated in the

203
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,680
cannabis community

204
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
and source of joy to many i have no

205
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,879
doubt hey thank you i appreciate hearing

206
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
that i'm a source of joy

207
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,918
a lot of people tell me that i'm

208
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,918
appreciated in the community but

209
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,279
to be a source of joy as a new thing

210
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,560
thank you that is cool to hear

211
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,239
uh let me make sure there's no more to

212
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,959
read and then we will take care from

213
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
tonto

214
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,959
all right tonto let's talk about pollen

215
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,319
it sounds like you are going to use

216
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
multiple males you want to

217
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
reverse a plant make some pollen put

218
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
that pollen on some females

219
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,520
harvest those seeds then you'll have to

220
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,639
do it again i wouldn't recommend having

221
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,318
um multiple males in one run i would do

222
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,960
multiple i would do different runs those

223
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,439
would be

224
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
male a do a crop with him finish it

225
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,000
clean up harvest

226
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,680
then do it again it sounds like that may

227
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,199
be your strategy you want to know how to

228
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,478
get rid of the pollen how to ensure that

229
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,879
the pollen will not

230
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,719
stick around for future runs and cross

231
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,839
pollinate cross contaminate

232
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,240
the other grows basically water

233
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,119
will destroy pollen water deactivates

234
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,439
pollen so

235
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,959
once you have harvested take down the

236
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,560
plants empty out the room

237
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,399
just spray everything down with water

238
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,079
you can put another another cleaning

239
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,359
product in there if you choose to just

240
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,758
clean the room anyway

241
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,120
some sort of uh a sanitation product a

242
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
sterilization product

243
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
maybe some uh you could put hydrogen

244
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,759
peroxide in there you can put there's a

245
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,038
product i'm really trying to think of

246
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
and it will not come to the top of my

247
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,079
head right now but you can put that

248
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,879
faizan 20 there we go that's the one i

249
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,879
was trying to think of

250
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,719
you can put some faizan 20 in there

251
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,918
sterilize the room clean up the room but

252
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
basically water

253
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,198
will deactivate the pollen so once

254
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,560
you've harvested the seeds you've got

255
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,879
the room clean there are no plants in

256
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,199
there

257
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,639
just go crazy with the water i like to

258
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
spray everything

259
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,079
even the equipment that probably

260
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,079
shouldn't get that wet i still missed it

261
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,079
down i unplug everything it's turned off

262
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,000
i put my mister as fine as it will go so

263
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,519
i'm putting just super mist everywhere

264
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,360
i'll miss it and i'll do that just every

265
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,878
couple of days when the plants are new

266
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,319
if i put new plants in there i'll just

267
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
go spray them with the foliar feed and

268
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
while i'm hitting them with the foliar

269
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,478
i'll also just get the rest of the room

270
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,279
just get the humidity real high get

271
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,519
water in there

272
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
again that water deactivates pollen so

273
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,359
if you just want to destroy the pollen

274
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
get it wet that is the main key you're

275
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,680
probably going to clean the room enough

276
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
between crops just in your basic

277
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
cleaning if you're getting in there and

278
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,159
scrubbing things down wiping everything

279
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
down you're probably going to get rid of

280
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,560
the pollen just in that general cleaning

281
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
some things to think about we often miss

282
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,478
cleaning the tops of the lights if

283
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,079
you've got

284
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,439
square shaped lights if you don't have

285
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,719
some lights around and they aren't

286
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,360
shaped the right way to gather stuff at

287
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
the top

288
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,120
but some lights are long like if you've

289
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,758
got a magnum xxl eight inch [ __ ]

290
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,158
reflector

291
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,918
you've got a big bench up there a big

292
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,599
seating area for pollen just to land up

293
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,439
there make sure you wipe all that stuff

294
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,278
off don't forget to look above your head

295
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,760
wipe all that stuff off any surface that

296
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,240
may get

297
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,799
dusty that dust is probably containing

298
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,799
pollen

299
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,559
clean that all up so water is going to

300
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,039
be what gets rid of the pollen

301
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,559
um water will help you make sure so if

302
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,919
you've got other plants in the area and

303
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,879
you're pollinating plants over here and

304
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,000
there are plants over here you don't

305
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,200
want to get pollinated

306
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,799
you know you're going to be jostling

307
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
pollen around spray the plants on the

308
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,039
other side with water

309
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
and their pistols are basically

310
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,159
deactivated when the water comes or when

311
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,000
the pollen comes the water will

312
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
the pollen will hit the water the plants

313
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,799
won't get pregnant on this side you can

314
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
pollinate the plants on this side don't

315
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,879
rely on that as your only fail safe

316
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,000
but that is another level uh i guess

317
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,439
that's a little uh

318
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
what is it birth control for your plants

319
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
there so water is the main way

320
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,839
to deactivate pollen water water water

321
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
spray it spray it a lot spray it

322
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,680
excessively

323
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
then you can just keep spraying water

324
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,319
when you're full you're feeding things

325
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,919
just spray the room also if you're

326
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
pesticide feeding or spraying

327
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,919
spray the room also just put more water

328
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
on the walls on the gear and wipe

329
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,799
everything down

330
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
get rid of it pollen usually if it's

331
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,159
left in that room with all the

332
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,159
temperature swings humidity spikes

333
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,079
all the activity all the light all the

334
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,278
darkness that pollen will probably

335
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
deactivate itself

336
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,759
in 60 to 90 days it could survive longer

337
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,599
if the conditions are right but

338
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,439
you're getting light and cold or light

339
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
and dark you're getting hot and cold

340
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
all the temperatures are changing the

341
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
environment is changing that pollen

342
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,519
that's free and loose is going to

343
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
degrade and deactivate quite quickly

344
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,440
so tonto i hope i answered your question

345
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
i rambled on quite a bit about that one

346
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
water is the key to deactivating paula

347
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,120
all right we've got another message this

348
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,640
one came from our friend

349
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,320
um they call themselves max scrim

350
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,000
and ruby there might be a joke in there

351
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
i don't get but what up max scrim and

352
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
ruby

353
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,319
welcome to the show thank you for the

354
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
patreon support the question goes hey

355
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,399

new patreon member here hey thank you

357
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
for joining never too late

358
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
says first off i love the show and i

359
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,559
have talked to you on instagram

360
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,919
this is max scrim and ruby oh anyway you

361
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,919
can refer to us as max

362
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,519
scrim and ruby what's up guys a big

363
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,078
shout out to my new friends it says

364
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,440
my question for you is the herbs now i

365
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,120
just purchased one and i want to know

366
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
what you think about using that

367
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
as the drying and curing part of the

368
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,039
grow we don't work this hard for months

369
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
to create good product and then ruin it

370
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,519
in the final steps

371
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,759
thank you for what you do for the

372
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
community brother much love from your

373
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,600
homie

374
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,959
max scrim and ruby

375
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
all right so what this listener is

376
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,838
asking about is a product called the

377
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,919
herbs

378
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
now it is a drying and curing rack that

379
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,759
is for sale i've seen it on social media

380
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,399
i've seen it advertised in a couple of

381
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,679
grow

382
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,600
magazines and grow uh geared outlets

383
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,679
let's talk about it for a moment i think

384
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,639
it is kind of modeled after

385
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,000
a food dehydrator this thing looks just

386
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,519
like a food dehydrator

387
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
it's got a setting on the front that you

388
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
set it to the setting you want it

389
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
it says that it comes pre-programmed to

390
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
dry your herb to

391
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
15 moisture within 96 hours and that is

392
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,240
four days if you do the math

393
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,039
on that 96 divided by 24 that's four

394
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,320
days they say that your herb will be dry

395
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,199
so i don't like it dry that fast

396
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
i want it to take longer they say that

397
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
it is the perfect temperature and the

398
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,278
perfect humidity inside

399
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,440
of that container to dry it perfectly i

400
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,879
am skeptical i would like to see some

401
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,320
herb that came from that

402
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:55,600
and see what it does i prefer a nice dry

403
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
a nice slow dry here in colorado if i

404
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,639
hang my

405
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,439
plants they can be dry in about five to

406
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,440
seven days

407
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
but i do things to make them dry more

408
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,959
slowly i want it to take

409
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,759
longer i think during the drying curing

410
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,439
process

411
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,200
a lot of chemical reactions that are

412
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
very important for quality buds

413
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
happen in that process we're not going

414
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,199
to get too far into that

415
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,759
but i think that a longer slower drying

416
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
cure

417
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,838
makes for a better finished product this

418
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,599
thing seems like a fast track to

419
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
speeding things up and that doesn't seem

420
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
like the way to go

421
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,879
for drying and curing although the

422
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,679
science behind the device

423
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,919
the uh just the way that they designed

424
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,479
it

425
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,399
the science the theory in theory it

426
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,278
looks like it would really work but i am

427
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
skeptical

428
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,480
and i've never seen one in person but i

429
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
feel skeptical

430
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
but i don't it could be amazing i don't

431
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,799
want to come on my show where a lot of

432
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,600
people listen and say yeah that thing

433
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,719
doesn't look like

434
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,519
it would do what you're thinking it's

435
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,240
going to do but it could it could not

436
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,799
i am scared of it because i want my buds

437
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,879
to dry

438
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,919
more slowly the one thing i did think

439
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,838
about

440
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,360
is if you're in like florida or

441
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,360
somewhere where it's real sticky and you

442
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,278
got a lot of humidity a lot of moisture

443
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,879
and it takes too long for your buds to

444
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,559
dry this may be

445
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,879
a good device for you but here i'm in

446
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,159
colorado i'm trying to slow down the

447
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,559
drying of my product

448
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,639
i want five or seven maybe 10 maybe even

449
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,119
12 days of drying time

450
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,799
this thing says 96 hours i don't know

451
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
about that herb that i've had that dried

452
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,000
too fast too quickly

453
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
never tasted the way that i wished it

454
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
would taste the herb that took a little

455
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
bit longer always tasted

456
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
better in my opinion so without having

457
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,799
touched the product without having

458
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,759
smoked any of the product that came out

459
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,519
of this device

460
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,278
i can't give you like a real definite

461
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,600
answer that would be unfair

462
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,799
it looks like it could go either way to

463
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
tell you the honest truth i don't think

464
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,759
it is the product for me

465
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,120
but i don't know where you are like i

466
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,919
said if you're in a high humidity

467
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
environment

468
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,278
if you really need to get that product

469
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
dried and cured out of there

470
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,480
that may be the way to do it if you have

471
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,399
been not hitting

472
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
your dry and cured goals if you're not

473
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,799
getting it dialed in properly this may

474
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
help

475
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,799
if you're completely ruining your

476
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
product at the end and you're not happy

477
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,319
this could be the rescuer if you're

478
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
already sucking this may improve it

479
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
but i think old-school drying and curing

480
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,159
is basically free you don't need to buy

481
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
too much equipment for a small grow

482
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,278
uh you may need a humidifier and a

483
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,638
dehumidifier if you're buying that much

484
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,078
gear that may be when it comes to

485
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
looking into one of these

486
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,359
but without seeing it without touching

487
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
it i can't give you a real honest

488
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,959
evaluation um i wish i did

489
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,159
have more info for you uh buy one you

490
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,078
said you bought one so

491
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,439
run it see what it does bro dry some of

492
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,559
your herb the way you used to and then

493
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
dry some of your herb

494
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,919
in this machine and compare see what you

495
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,360
like better and then give me some

496
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,439
feedback and we can talk about it

497
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,039
on the show all right i want to keep

498
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,240
moving because i do have a nice

499
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,799
stack of patreon messages here uh this

500
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,720

502
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
because when i tried to print the

503
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,159
message it did not print so we're going

504
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
to scroll through

505
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,439

506
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,359

521
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,000

527
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160

my knees are starting to hurt my wrists

531
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
feel weird

532
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
i think it's from bashing on [ __ ] for

533
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,959
way too long um

534
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,959

535
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,000

536
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,239

537
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,720
loves that's why we get along bro keeps

538
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,278
going it says my question is this

539
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
i am growing a critical mass one-to-one

540
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,679
auto

541
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,039
so he's got a it's got a one-to-one

542
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,359
ratio of cbd

543
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,879
to thc is what was advertised on the

544
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,159
package he hasn't tested the product

545
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,799
because it is still growing

546
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,278
but that is what is to be expected from

547
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,039
the phenotype based on advertising

548
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,958
it says august 5th will be eight weeks

549
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,559
into flower so i have just started

550
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,159
flushing all right so you've got a eight

551
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,239
or nine week plant maybe a nine or ten

552
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,120
week plant you've just begun the flush

553
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399

554
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
guideline apply

555
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,919
the same to cbd rich plants as straight

556
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,879

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,838
papa z then it says

559
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600

560
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,839
from your heart sticker

561
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
um i would have to make them there are

562
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,560
no grow from your heart podcast stickers

563
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,320
available yet

564
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,919
but it is almost time for me to place an

565
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,639
order with my sticker maker and i may

566
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,519
include

567
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,959
the gfyh logo in that sticker print

568
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,679
we'll see how that one goes so when i

569
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,518
make stickers

570
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,638
uh i'll keep you posted i owe you a

571
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,919
sticker because you support me on

572
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
patreon so thank you

573
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,240
now let's talk about your trichomes uh

574
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,319
you're growing for

575
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
cbd you're trying to get that one-to-one

576
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,920
cbd to thc ratio

577
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,399
i am not a cbd expert that is not my

578
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,719
realm that is not my desire i don't grow

579
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
for cbd i want the opposite if you guys

580
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,199
know me

581
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,038
i want to get high i want to go up i

582
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,399
think going up makes me feel better

583
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,318
cbd makes me feel i lose dexterity if i

584
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
were playing i don't play video games

585
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,599
i don't play guitar but if i ever try to

586
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,958
play guitar i do kind of fiddle on a

587
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,438
guitar it's not my thing but i've got

588
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
one and

589
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,240
i dick around on it so if i smoke a cbd

590
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,838
product and try to dick around on the

591
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,558
guitar my fingers

592
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,720
aren't as dexterous as they would be had

593
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,759
i not consumed the cbd product they get

594
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,839
a little rubbery

595
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,960
a little gumby like i just don't have

596
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,879
the full control

597
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
like i feel like i normally would have

598
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
not consumed cbd so i'm not a cbd

599
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,479
expert i don't grow cbd i don't breed

600
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,599
cbd

601
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,640
but i would like to assume that you're

602
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,439
still going to

603
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
use that amber trichome 30 amber

604
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
trichome guideline

605
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,720
because we still want ripe trichomes i

606
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,678
think they're ripe when they are that

607
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,319
color i don't know

608
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,559
which cannabinoid they are ripe with but

609
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,159
it feels like that is a ripe trichome

610
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,678
uh we want fruits when they're ripe we

611
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,519
can identify when they're ripe we still

612
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,519
want our cannabis ripe and i think

613
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,720
that that trichome color is still the

614
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,759
way to determine that

615
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,759
even though we're going after the cbd

616
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,119
i wish i had better input for you i'm

617
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,919
sitting here thinking of different ways

618
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,678
to think of this

619
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
but i think that's the best way to do it

620
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
just go by those trichomes just like you

621
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,759
normally do i'm going to take a quick

622
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,759
drink and we're going to keep moving

623
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,279
all right i even thought about it while

624
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
i was drinking and i want you to

625
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,440
continue by following that 30

626
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,279
amber trichome rule and if there are any

627
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,320
cbd farmers out there who have better

628
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,160
guidance for us

629
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,240

switching to irie genetics

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,440
patreon messages unless we get a bunch

775
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,279
more

776
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,558
but let's keep the show moving this one

777
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,399
says hey ross to jeff

778
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,960
i wanted to run a question across you to

779
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
see if you had any ideas i feel like i

780
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,319
am the guy to answer

781
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,158
this question that says i have a 10 pack

782
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,599
of seeds from a breeder

783
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,799
back in the day i'm not going to say the

784
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,599
seeds or the breeder we're going to keep

785
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,119
that out of this

786
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,119
because i started three and rapid

787
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,759
rooters like i always do and a tray with

788
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,399
dome

789
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,038
and a tray with the dome under t5s the

790
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
temperature is 76 and the humidity is 62

791
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,679
percent

792
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,759
after a couple of days the seeds

793
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,519
developed fuzz on them so i cleaned them

794
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,558
off and put them in soil

795
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,720
so far after a week on sprouting

796
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,000
and put them in soil so far after a week

797
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
of sprouting we're going to say that was

798
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,558
supposed to say of sprouting

799
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,279
so oh they this person started off some

800
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,119
seeds

801
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,720
10 of them and they put them in rapid

802
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,639
rooters the way that they normally do

803
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,079
they put them in a tray with a dome

804
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,679
under t5s

805
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,599
uh that works for you i don't do the

806
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
dome i don't like a dome for my seeds i

807
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,119
don't find it necessary we use the dome

808
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,480
for clones to keep the humidity in there

809
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,119
because they don't have roots to feed

810
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
from

811
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,399
the seedlings they don't need as much

812
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,839
humidity i feel like it makes them weak

813
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,120
we've got to take them off the dome and

814
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,038
introduce them to the environment

815
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,798
i don't ever give them a dome they don't

816
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,079
start off being babied and pampered

817
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,918
i think it gives them a little bit of a

818
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,678
boost a little bit more strength the way

819
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,360
you're doing it if it works for you

820
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
do that but i'm just saying i don't do

821
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,439
the dome it says temperature 76 that

822
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,960
should be fine i may go a little bit

823
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,960
warmer but they're going to be okay

824
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
humidity is 62 that's going to work for

825
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,360
you after a couple of days

826
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,640
the seeds developed fuzz on them um

827
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,399
that could be a couple of things but i

828
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,159
want to keep reading i've never had this

829
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
problem before with this method i have

830
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,120
seen that some people use dr

831
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,359
zymes before putting seeds into the

832
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,359
rooter will this help or are the seeds

833
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,240
just bad feel free to use this question

834
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,918
on the show

835
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
big thanks for everything you do and

836
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,038
dropping free knowledge hey you are very

837
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,599
welcome

838
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,440
let's talk about this uh this could be a

839
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,038
couple of things

840
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
it sounds like you've done this before

841
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,038
and you know what you're doing but

842
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,240
possibly i'm not blaming you this is an

843
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,000
option possibly

844
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,000
that rapid router that moist rapid

845
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,119
router that seed that dome that heat

846
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,278
that environment

847
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,599
that could have caused a little bit of

848
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,480
that uh cobweb spiderweb look in white

849
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,798
mildew

850
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
that could have caused that i don't know

851
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,158
i'm not blaming you i'm just listing

852
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
options that could have done it it could

853
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,000
have been the moisture in the rapid

854
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,759
rooter

855
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
being stuck in the dome that could have

856
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,319
set up the perfect environment for that

857
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,798
mildew

858
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,079
the other option is maybe j and this is

859
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,599
why i didn't say the breeder of the

860
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,399
seeds or the name of the strain

861
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,639
it is possible that those seeds came

862
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,038
from plants that had powdery mildew in

863
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
them

864
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,000
and maybe they just had mildew on the

865
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
plants maybe there was some sort of a

866
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,960
pathogen in the plants

867
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,480
also maybe another option maybe when

868
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
those seeds were harvested

869
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,000
maybe they were not allowed to dry

870
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,599
properly before they were put into a

871
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
package they were still moist

872
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,119
they were sealed up they were put into a

873
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,558
package a little bit of mildew developed

874
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,918
that way you seal up moisture

875
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,599
and you give it a little bit of heat

876
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,559
that is the perfect environment dark

877
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,558
moist and warm

878
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,319
that's going to give you mildew so those

879
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,639
are three ways that that mildew could

880
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,558
have

881
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
happened in your seedlings you could

882
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,599
have gotten it in the rapid rooter

883
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,599
it could have happened in the plants

884
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,079
while they were growing or it could have

885
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,158
happened

886
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,079
in packaging when a grower brew when you

887
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
breed seeds it's a lot like having a wet

888
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,240
herb

889
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
and then you have a bunch of wet herbs

890
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,798
you get it dry enough to take the seeds

891
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,719
out you take the seeds out

892
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,079
the seeds still have moisture in them

893
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,759
and on them sometimes and

894
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,199
if you're in a big hurry you're just a

895
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,640
commercial producer trying to get them

896
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,919
out maybe just maybe

897
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,000
you packaged them up you didn't give

898
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,759
enough time still a little bit moist

899
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,359
that's a possibility i don't know

900
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,119
exactly what happened but those are the

901
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,798
three things that come to my mind

902
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,959
when i try to think about why your

903
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,359
little seedlings may have gotten fuzzy

904
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,038
now you ask people use dr zymes before

905
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,119
putting the seeds into the rooter

906
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,960
will that help uh that may have helped

907
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,079
depending on what that

908
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
pathogen was on there maybe possibly

909
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,319
probably

910
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,159
i've also seen people put a little bit

911
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,119
of hydrogen peroxide in the water to try

912
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,640
to take care of that

913
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,719
so that may have been an option for you

914
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,120
also i think we spoke a little bit about

915
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,558
this

916
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,239
i think you've already found a solution

917
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,759
for your seedlings all right i want to

918
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,120
thank you for the great message i hope i

919
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,240
solved your problem or at least gave you

920
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,599
a little bit of insight

921
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,960
i'm not sure if you want your name said

922
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,678
on the show you did not include it here

923
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
in the email

924
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
you know who you are big thank you i see

925
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,319

926
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
quite a bit i see you in the instagram

927
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,240
feed all the time thank you for hanging

928
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,759
out

929
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,159
all right i want to read another message

930
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,000
this one says yo rasta jeff i love the

931
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,640
show and the in-depth answers you give

932
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,319
to each question a lot of people don't

933
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,080
like the in-depth answers i get rambly a

934
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,599
little bit but i'm glad you enjoy the

935
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,199
in-depth answers

936
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,519
it says it really shows how much

937
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,278
preparation goes into each response

938
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,960
i write down a few notes on each email

939
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,558
and then i try to keep it spontaneous

940
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,880
and go from the top of my head

941
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,480
i did an episode a couple of shows back

942
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
where i took way too many notes and it

943
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,038
didn't feel natural i didn't like the

944
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,720
show's flow

945
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,240
so i try to just make a couple of bullet

946
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
points and keep it going

947
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,919
keep it flowing naturally keep it

948
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
conversational i'd rather talk with you

949
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,200
than to you or at you i think is what

950
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,480
i'm trying to say but

951
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,480
let me continue because i'm doing that

952
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,159
thing where i ramble again anyways i'm

953
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,679
watching a short video on terpenes right

954
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,000
now and it made me think of your comment

955
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,600
on a recent episode about limonene

956
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,519
coming out when you have your lights

957
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,079
closer to the plants yes

958
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,679
i have said before that i believe we can

959
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,839
bring out the limonene

960
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,919
if you've got a lemon flavored plant and

961
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,839
you want it to be even more lemony

962
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,360
get it a little bit too close to the

963
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,519
light late in flower i think

964
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,719
limonene is sort of a stress response

965
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,639
kind of a reaction

966
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,480
i don't know exactly what it does but

967
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
the plant goes [ __ ] it's way too hot

968
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
it's way too light i'm going to

969
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,278
create this thing and it makes limonine

970
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
i don't know what the plant thinks it's

971
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,558
gonna do

972
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,919
but it does that and it creates limonene

973
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,359
and we harvest those plants and they

974
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,278
taste [ __ ] lemony

975
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,398
i had a sour diesel plant they grew way

976
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,558
too close to the light

977
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,839
and it tastes like lemon sour diesel

978
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:28,960
that's part of what made me start

979
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,879
thinking about this

980
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
then i noticed those plants that got too

981
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
close to the light always have that

982
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
sour sweeter sort of thing going on all

983
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
right so let's get back into this email

984
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,799
it keeps going it says

985
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,278
this video is saying that the plant can

986
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,960
put out different terpenes at the top

987
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,398
where it is more prone to insects

988
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,240
including limonene

989
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,079
at the bottom it may put out more bitter

990
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,240
terpenes to keep grazing

991
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,158
mammals away i thought that was pretty

992
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,200
cool and it shows that you are on to

993
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
something with

994
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,278
your theory yeah i like that a lot and

995
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,440
that makes a lot of sense

996
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,960
if you think about like grazing animals

997
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,080
anything from like a chicken to a

998
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,679
[ __ ] pig

999
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,278
or a cow anything that would come around

1000
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,960
and eat the bottom of a plant

1001
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,558
it makes it taste bitter so that that

1002
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,679
cow goes chomp chomp oh that tastes like

1003
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,720
[ __ ] i don't want none of that and it

1004
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,000
walks away from it

1005
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,079
but up at the top you're going to get

1006
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,119
completely different attackers spider

1007
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,558
mites

1008
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,239
they're going to be up there at the top

1009
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,158
so it makes that limonene so when the

1010
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
spider mites go up they go this is sour

1011
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,760
bro i don't want to be up here

1012
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,278
and they take off so i love that you

1013
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,599
gave me some feedback and i love that

1014
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,200
i've got some scientific support here

1015
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,278
and then it says keep putting out that

1016
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,759
great content from the smokin

1017
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,480
cuskogan uh and then it says ps the

1018
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,519
video is

1019
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,839
terpenes and marijuana explained with dr

1020
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,519
jake feliz so if anybody else out there

1021
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,480
would like some supplemental terpene

1022
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,960
education

1023
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,839
check out terpenes in marijuana

1024
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,120
explained

1025
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,319
by dr jake felice it sounds like i may

1026
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,319
be watching that video

1027
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,678
when i'm done recording here i hate

1028
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,240
smoking muskogen

1029
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
thank you for the great feedback i love

1030
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
hearing

1031
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,839
that somebody out there supported some

1032
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,000
of my wild

1033
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,359
cannabis theories all right i've been

1034
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,440
going for a minute but i've got one more

1035
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,759
message that i want to read

1036
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
let's see this one says what's happening

1037
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,119
ross to jeff i just wanted to reach out

1038
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,640
and give you a follow-up to a question

1039
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,678
you read on the podcast

1040
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,360
regarding an m-dog hermaphrodite so i

1041
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,919
did chop her down at week six

1042
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,558
and you were right it was loaded with

1043
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
seeds

1044
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,240
i remember saying that if you can see a

1045
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,720
few seeds on the outside of that bud

1046
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,640
it is probably loaded up on the inside

1047
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,000
it sounds like i was correct it was

1048
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,679
loaded with seeds and see uh let's see

1049
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,159
and it also he also seeded a swamp boy's

1050
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,519
shocky plant i had near her that was a

1051
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,320
rough sentence but we got through it

1052
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,558
together

1053
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,599
i run that m-dog perpetually and the

1054
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,440
reason i wanted to

1055
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,439
to discuss this with you is i feel that

1056
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,080
i have experienced genetic

1057
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,720
drift i've done a podcast about genetic

1058
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,639
drift

1059
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,319
and briefly no that's not what is

1060
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,919
happening um

1061
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,759
we can explain genetic drift again but

1062
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,200
that is not what genetic drift is it

1063
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,798
says i know you've discussed this in a

1064
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,120
couple of episodes and i feel like i've

1065
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,759
explained this i stated the mdo i

1066
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,278
started the m dog back in april of 2019

1067
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,000
and i've been cloning her

1068
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,359
before i send her into flower um not

1069
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,759
cloning it okay so you're

1070
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,119
uh cutting a clone letting it veg

1071
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,640
cutting clones from that then putting

1072
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,079
that big plant into flower that's

1073
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,600
basically how we keep a plant around

1074
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,359
it's similar to doing a mom plant you

1075
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,359
just flower out that mom

1076
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,439
it says so she's running for a little

1077
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,119
over a year then i had that one herme

1078
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,960
that i sent you the question on

1079
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,038
then the following two plants also

1080
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,079
hermed on the same spots the lower

1081
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,919
branches

1082
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,759
i run organics and i didn't have any

1083
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
light leaks so i'm thinking this was

1084
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,240
genetic drift

1085
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,678
what do you think i don't have enough

1086
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,798
data on your grow

1087
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,880
to have a solid opinion but i think that

1088
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,558
the plant has always been a herm and you

1089
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
are just now giving it the proper

1090
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:54,079
conditions to express that trait

1091
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,879
maybe that is my assumption plants don't

1092
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,439
tend to just

1093
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
become herm that doesn't and i don't

1094
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,640
think that's a genetic drift

1095
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
thing i think you're just now giving it

1096
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,559
the environment uh

1097
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,000
the situation whatever there's something

1098
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,759
that is triggering it to her that it

1099
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,319
never had before so what is different

1100
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,398
now

1101
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,359
that wasn't different before is the soil

1102
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,119
a little bit hotter

1103
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,119
is the soil weaker is your feed more

1104
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,678
rich is the room more humid is it too

1105
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,639
hot

1106
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,360
there could be any number of factors

1107
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
deciding

1108
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,479
making this plant decide that now i want

1109
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,479
to be a her

1110
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,759
so it says do you think cloning over and

1111
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,759
over again for a year

1112
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,519
caused her to just say [ __ ] this i'm

1113
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,440
really curious to see what you think

1114
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,359
thank you so much for your support i'm

1115
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,440
on patreon as buzzards

1116
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,398
bay hey buzzards bay thank you for the

1117
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,880
question

1118
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,678
i really don't have a definitive answer

1119
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,679
other than

1120
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,840
i think that you just finally gave this

1121
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,200
plant the environment to hermaphrodite

1122
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,480
you've been running it for a year

1123
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,798
i don't know how many crops you've had

1124
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,640
before that but i'm going to assume that

1125
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,319
the first time you ran it

1126
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,080
it's like a first date the first time

1127
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,519
you go out first time you ran this plant

1128
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,678
first time you took this girl out

1129
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,038
you were real polite real gentle you

1130
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,798
followed the book you read all the

1131
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,158
instructions you did the cool guy kind

1132
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,918
guy polite guy move

1133
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,360
did all that [ __ ] right the plant was

1134
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,880
happy with you and it put out

1135
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,479
the second time you got cocky you're

1136
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
like you put out the first time watch me

1137
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
this time

1138
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,000
you're kind of a dick i'm not saying

1139
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,720
you're a dick i'm just saying this is

1140
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,398
what we do

1141
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
you got too comfortable with the plan

1142
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,359
you didn't open the car door right after

1143
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,759
dinner when you're walking that plan out

1144
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,439
to

1145
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,879
the car after you ate last time you

1146
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,000
opened the car door made sure she was in

1147
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,440
there comfortably made sure that her

1148
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,640
dress wasn't hanging out of the car door

1149
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,640
you tucked your dress in

1150
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,840
closed the door nice and gently farted

1151
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
while you were out of the car ran around

1152
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,959
the car got to your door made sure the

1153
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
fart smell was gone then you got in

1154
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,319
uh the second time you went on the date

1155
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,840
you guys after dinner you just [ __ ]

1156
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,519
opened your own car door and jumped in

1157
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,480
you farted in the car that's what

1158
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,319
happens to guys

1159
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,240
we go real careful we follow the book

1160
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,599
the first time that second time we get

1161
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,359
kind of cocky and we forget that there's

1162
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,519
a lot of steps and a lot of rules

1163
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,119
so i'm assuming that maybe the first

1164
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,640
time you were real real careful with

1165
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,319
this plant you're like she's new

1166
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,000
she takes this long to flower i got a

1167
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,599
learner i got to figure her out

1168
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,440
second time you may have taken it for

1169
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,000
granted said she put out real well the

1170
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
first time

1171
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,558
i'm going back for more of that the

1172
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,000
second time but you didn't take all the

1173
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:02,879
steps to get it to put out the way you

1174
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,480
expected it to

1175
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,240
that may be the most crass description

1176
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,719
i've ever given on a podcast but

1177
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,838
i think you understood exactly what the

1178
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,118
[ __ ] i meant

1179
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,878
all right i hope i answered your

1180
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,320
question i really think that that plant

1181
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:15,358
was probably a hermaphrodite the whole

1182
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,838
time and you were just now

1183
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,719
giving it the opportunity to show you

1184
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,159
