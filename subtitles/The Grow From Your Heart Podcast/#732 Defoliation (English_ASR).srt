120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,560

121
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,240
727

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,280
when you were talking about integrated

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,519
pest management strategies i just wanted

124
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,239
to share a factoid regarding the hop

125
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,879
latent viroid on a previous episode i

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,040
did mention hoplate and viroid a virus

127
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,478
that many growers are being struck with

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
stricken with

129
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,079
however they're all getting this virus

130
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,239
right now everybody is encouraging or

131
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,639
encountering this virus in a commercial

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
grow in a home grow a lot of the grows

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,439
in california had to deal with this hop

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,240
late and viroid anyway he says just a

135
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,079
factoid i learned in the cannabis uh

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
regenerative conference big shout out to

137
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,199
our boys at the cannabis regen

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
conference uh they do a lot of great

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,720
work support them if you can it says

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,280
apparently alcohol does not kill the hop

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
latent viroid so what i said was to make

142
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,038
sure to dunk your scissors and maybe

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,600
your tools into some alcohol between

144
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,599
plants between rows apparently that's

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
ineffective that's not going to do it so

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
i may have told you to waste a step i

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
may have given you shitty advice i

148
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,120
thought to the best of my knowledge that

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,199
alcohol would sterilize your scissors

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,439
and kill that virus our friends at the

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
regenerative regenerative you say that

152
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,800
quickly our friends at the regen

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
conference have learned and taught us

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,038
that

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,800
that alcohol will not kill that virus uh

156
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,120
it says apparently alcohol doesn't kill

157
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,000
hlv as they clean up strategy it just

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,840
depends uh it just spreads it around

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,360
then it says um

160
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,918
hypochlorous acid which is hoci will

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,160
kill the hoplayton viroid just something

162
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,879
to consider when cleaning those scissors

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,919
from plants to plants best wishes to all

164
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,519

206
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,840
jeff long time first time love the

207
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,120
podcast and have learnt so much from you

208
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,959
i'm just going to add the word mate in

209
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,038
here occasionally he did not type the

210
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,399
word mate but it says thank you mate

211
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,000
then it says i remember you talking

212
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,799
about how you would teach someone to

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
defoliate specifically during flower

214
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,079
when you were teaching that you

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,478
mentioned something along the lines of

216
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,478
anything with a purple petiole can come

217
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,000
off that is something i do remember

218
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,000
teaching practicing and saying on the

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,918
podcast that is still kind of a rule

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,478
that i follow i do believe that those

221
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,719
purple petioles are a good indicator

222
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,240
in the early flower room that those

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
leaves can come off i'll keep talking

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,720
about that as we go it says i wonder if

225
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
your stance has changed or if you have

226
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
more information or if you still

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
practice this i still do this

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,199
unfortunately with the um

229
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
excuse me for the throat clearing

230
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,160
unfortunately with the the pandemic we

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,079
had uh a lot of my career opportunities

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
and career moves did change i left a lot

233
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,478
of the commercial cultivation

234
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,240
consultation jobs because uh the

235
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,000
commercial crews the commercial grows

236
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
went down to uh what i was calling a

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
skeleton crew there was a lead grower

238
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
and then as minimal of a crew as they

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,760
could handle in there the lead grower

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
was doubling up his work all the main

241
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,679
growers were doubling up their work we

242
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,278
took people from working uh eight hour

243
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,120
shifts to working ten hour shifts that

244
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,639
way we didn't have to have as many

245
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
people coming and going from the groves

246
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,799
we just had uh the same people there all

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
the time to keep numbers down uh just

248
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,319
that was what we were doing for the uh

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
the pandemic the lockdown the quarantine

250
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,480
situation so when that was happening i

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
didn't want to be uh at all of these

252
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,278
grows my job is to travel from two or

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
three different grows a day uh do one

254
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,080
before lunch one after lunch and then

255
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
try to squeeze another one in whatever i

256
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
can during a day and go to these

257
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,278
different grows and see what's going on

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
that would put me in contact with a lot

259
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,360
of people and during the the quarantine

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
that wasn't necessary so i just chose to

261
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
uh i had contracts with a lot of places

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
and around september october they all

263
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,958
expired and i did not renew

264
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,479
many of them i have a couple of things

265
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,479
that i do on the side but i'm not

266
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,200
heavily contracted so i'm not in the

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,320
commercial grows as much as i was but i

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,080
still remember that the uh defoliation

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
strategy yes anything with a purple

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,320
petiole i do still employ the strategy

271
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,559
of let's pull that off that's what i

272
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,600
teach the uh the crew the grotex the

273
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,278
growers in the rooms is to remove those

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
there's more to this message let me read

275
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,879
it so that i could stay on track it says

276
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,399
i found this to be a pretty great rule

277
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,639
but i would love you to do

278
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,639
more uh would love you to go more into

279
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,360
removing large amounts of fan leaves

280
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,600
during flower perhaps day 21 roughly for

281
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,639
me on a flood and drain coco he tells us

282
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
about his grow it's still going to be

283
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,838
the same almost no matter how your grow

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,519
is i'm probably going to defoliate at

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
certain times just depends on how

286
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,759
intensely we will do it will be the

287
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,200
adjustments and the anomalies uh then he

288
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:16,319
says how about schwazing or stripping or

289
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,560
week 3 or day 21 a heavy doing a heavy

290
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
defoliation yes all of what you're

291
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,399
saying makes sense i will talk about

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
removing uh heavy amounts of leaves

293
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,440
since i'm thought thinking about this

294
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,320
and we're right here at this point if

295
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
you're going to heavily strip the room

296
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
and defoliate a lot of plants in a room

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
i'm used to working in large rooms your

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
spaces aren't probably as big as what

299
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,399
i'm thinking about but if you're going

300
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
to work in a space and you're going to

301
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
defoliate it

302
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,679
my advice and i do apologize for the

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
throat clearing i smoked rosin on a hot

304
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,319
nail i feel good but i got the throat

305
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
butter

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
the lung butter um so if you're going to

307
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,360
defoliate the room and you want to

308
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,199
defoliate i'm just going to make up a

309
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
scale let's say we're going to defoliate

310
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
on a on a one to five scale you want to

311
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,278
hit a hard four that's your goal right i

312
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,278
would not defoliate i would not start at

313
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,919
the plant in the corner and defoliate it

314
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,679
to a four i would do everything to a

315
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,838
level two and then i would come back and

316
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,759
do everything to a level three then come

317
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,760
back and do everything to a level four

318
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,679
that way uh we do it in a commercial

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,759
grow this way because it takes a lot

320
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,120
more time to defoliate i've got multiple

321
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,278
dudes and dudettes and non-binary folk

322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,679
in a room defoliating their asses off

323
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,679
all day long i don't want this section

324
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,519
of the room to be naked and no leaves in

325
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,838
this room still to look like the 70s and

326
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
be all bushy i want to kind of keep it

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,000
even throughout the room so that we're

328
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,519
going to talk more about micro climates

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
and temperature pockets and humidity

330
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
pockets and things in the room i want to

331
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
prevent that so i'm going to defoliate

332
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
evenly just do a level 1 strip a level 2

333
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
and just do it in increments instead of

334
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
one section is naked one section is

335
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,360
really fuzzy

336
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
now you did mention the word schwazing

337
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,519
that is right here in the message i

338
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,839
don't necessarily do a schwas that is

339
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519
when you almost take off every leaf

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
except those two at the top you strip

341
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,799
almost every

342
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,119
bigger leaf with a pedial off of the

343
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,039
plant i don't go that hard if that is a

344
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,200
level five i would say i do about a

345
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,639
three and a half to a four i like to

346
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,079
leave some leaves on there i believe

347
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
that the leaves do have a function

348
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,799
they're there for a reason but i do

349
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,519
defoliate for a reason let me talk about

350
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,319
several of the reasons why i do choose

351
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,399
to defoliate the plants um

352
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,560
the rooms and commercial environments in

353
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
colorado the rooms are hard to dial in

354
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,000
large rooms and keep the uh the

355
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
environment the conditions ideal

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,039
throughout a large environment

357
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,600
throughout a large space we do get the

358
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,599
rooms somewhere between like 80 and 84

359
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
degrees and the humidity is right for

360
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,399
the phase of growth in which we are in

361
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,159
but we've got a range and if you walk

362
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,679
through the room as you go you could

363
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,679
feel it's more humid here it's hotter

364
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,479
here it's not extreme but as a grower

365
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,799
who can

366
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,959
identify that [ __ ] you will notice it so

367
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,719
by defoliating a lot of the leaves i can

368
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,319
prevent a lot of the microclimates

369
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
there's not as much uh is it

370
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,440
transpiration respiration there's not as

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,879
much i should have researched this i'm

372
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
talking really quickly also because i'm

373
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,799
high as [ __ ] there's not as much water

374
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,199
coming out of those leaves when i water

375
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,679
that room not having so much water in

376
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,920
the room reduces my opportunity for

377
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,679
powdery mildew in colorado we are

378
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,240
notorious for getting cholera or for

379
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,319
getting powdery mildew every time the uh

380
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,399
the season changes right now we're going

381
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,560
from the cold and wintry season into the

382
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,559
warmer spring season it seems like it's

383
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,638
winter one day summer the next we're not

384
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,719
going to get a spring but that type of

385
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,959
[ __ ] creates powdery mildew if we can't

386
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,399
dial in the rooms so by taking off some

387
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,078
of the leaf and taking off some of the

388
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,958
water in the room that will help me

389
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,559
mitigate those issues also where do bugs

390
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,958
and problems hide where does the powdery

391
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,199
mildew go where do the spider mites go

392
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,119
on the leaves if we take away the hotel

393
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,879
rooms if we take away the empty beds

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
there's nowhere for the powdery mildew

395
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,399
for the spider mites whatever other

396
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,399
insect you may run into there are less

397
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
places for them to go so we remove the

398
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,559
leaves from the room destroy the leaves

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,159
less opportunity less campsites for the

400
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,278
homeless spider mites to chill out in

401
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,719
there

402
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,240
now i'm going to get back to the message

403
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,759
because part of what you say does kind

404
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
of lead into more of what i want to talk

405
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,078
about it goes on it says from my own

406
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,639
test and seeing others work it seems i

407
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,719
can increase yields and overall quality

408
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,639
by improving airflow yes improving

409
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
airflow definitely helps

410
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,720
the plants are happier do you want to be

411
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
in a room when you spread out your arms

412
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
you touch your bros everywhere you reach

413
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,239
you can't get any of your own space

414
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
that sucks you kind of want to open your

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,759
arm sometimes stretch out you want to go

416
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,000
to get some space the plants want to do

417
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,519
the same thing if we take off off some

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,039
leaves the leaves aren't dangling

419
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,240
touching each other all the time that

420
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,439
will help them out they will also

421
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,480
prevent heat pockets it also says it

422
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,320
increases

423
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,240
light penetration yes if we take off a

424
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
lot of the leaves the lower buds will

425
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,000
get more light the lower buds will get

426
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,519
more density they'll get bigger stronger

427
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,278
more potent you won't have to trim up

428
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,198
that little larfee crap at the bottom

429
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,838
there then it says and my plant seems to

430
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,958
focus more on buds themselves resulting

431
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,560
in more dense less leafy finished

432
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,000
product yes you're setting yourself up

433
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,679
for success because in the end we've got

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
to cut all the leaves off anyway so if

435
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,919
we strategically start cutting those

436
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,519
leaves off early in flower and as we go

437
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,519
week by week take off some here some

438
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,879
there some here some there when it's at

439
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,120
the end of the season you don't have a

440
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,360
bunch of dreadlocked furry leafy plants

441
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
you've got less leaf to deal with so all

442
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,240
of your theories are accurate are

443
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,959
correct so let's talk about timing

444
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,159
i like to defoliate about uh just like

445
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,479
you're kind of doing it here right when

446
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,039
we move them into flower i will do a pop

447
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,759
a twist and a light defoliation then

448
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,480
around day 21 another papa twist and a

449
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,039
light defoliation then around week six

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
another light pop twist and defoliation

451
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,519
then just slowly defoliate as we go and

452
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,759
let the plants work and then

453
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,198
as i begin to flush i see in a

454
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,680
commercial grow it's hard to time

455
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,679
everybody we got a crew that is trimming

456
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,838
sometimes doing other [ __ ] sometimes

457
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,039
when i can get four or five people to go

458
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
into the room that's about to be

459
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,599
harvested i'll send them in there to do

460
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,120
uh strategic defoliation take off all

461
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,240
the leaves with pedials now let's talk

462
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,320
about why i say this i'll remove the

463
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,399
leaves with the petioles the pedials why

464
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,759
is that my strategy because if those

465
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,360
petioles have turned purple they're

466
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
probably old enough to have been on that

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
plant for the leaf to be big enough to

468
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,159
be blocking substantial light that's my

469
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,479
main uh diagnosis my main theory behind

470
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,719
that once that the petiole has turned

471
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,800
purple the leaf is probably bigger than

472
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
my hand which means it's probably big

473
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,240
enough to block light to the bud below

474
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,319
it it's probably big enough to uh let

475
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,159
off enough water to create a powdery

476
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,079
mildew environment it's definitely big

477
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,000
enough for thousands of spider mites to

478
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,159
congregate underneath and throw a party

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,919
and reproduce under there that purple

480
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,759
color tells me that that leaf is just

481
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,319
probably old enough and big enough to be

482
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,959
removed it's really easy i like to have

483
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
simple uh training techniques for people

484
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,239
uh no offense to the people who work in

485
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,399
commercial grows a lot of you are

486
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,480
amazing a lot of you amazing people also

487
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,720
have one day a week where you're too

488
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
[ __ ] high to figure out your own life

489
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
which hey do your thing pimpin sometimes

490
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
i get too high to handle my own life i

491
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,278
just don't do it at a commercial grow

492
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,559
you get lit up and then you go in there

493
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,639
and i've got to give you instructions

494
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,239
and crayons a lot of times if i write

495
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
down those instructions and crayons and

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,240
give somebody an objective they'll do it

497
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
like a [ __ ] robot all day but you

498
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
have to be able to explain it to them

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,160
like a puppy like they're stoned like

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it's their first day at work so if i say

501
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,759
take off all of the big leaves with the

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
purple stem they'll see the purple and

503
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,879
they'll just go start taking off leaves

504
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,240
it gives them confidence and then

505
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,160
they'll see what they did i could say

506
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,759
see like you remember how it looked

507
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,519
before do you remember how it looks now

508
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,879
now let's go and take off a few more

509
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,240
leaves and just clean it up a little bit

510
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
and do another level and i can teach

511
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
them it's just a training technique an

512
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,879
easy method of training the dudes uh the

513
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,640
dudettes the non-binary uh growers and

514
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
growtex this is getting weird in the

515
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
future here uh but that's my way of

516
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,079
training people that's why i say take

517
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,558
off the leaves with the purple starts

518
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,839
now your your girl scout cookies and

519
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,000
some of your stuff like that the soca

520
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,519
souffle is gonna make purple petioles uh

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,119
they're probably gonna be real long

522
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,798
those leaves are gonna be big and black

523
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,599
you can leave them on for the visual but

524
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,918
i would probably take them off uh i do

525
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,399
uh probably a level one defoliation on

526
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,240
the first day of flower like a level two

527
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
and a half to three defoliation if one

528
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
through five is our method here five is

529
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,480
naked and one is kind of just being lazy

530
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,919
i do a level one on day one

531
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,839
around day fourteen i'll hit him with a

532
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
two and a half to a three then around

533
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,918
week six i'll hit them with another

534
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,519
level three because they've bushed out

535
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,960
again i'm not gonna go past that level

536
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,798
three but i'm gonna get it back to the

537
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
three give it another buzz cut make sure

538
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,519
it's cleaned up in there

539
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,200
you can do

540
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,038
you can go kind of extreme on some

541
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,960
plants some plants however will not

542
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,119
recover from over stripping i've had

543
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,038
some strains that when you strip them

544
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,558
they stall they just freeze up they go

545
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,319
i'm naked i don't have any leaves i

546
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,678
don't know what to do some plants you

547
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,038
could do and they will really take off

548
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
and they'll really grow so this is going

549
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,038
to be strain specific environment

550
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
specific there are a lot of anomalies

551
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,879
that will factor in here let me get back

552
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,558
onto the email because there is more it

553
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
says are there commercial examples of

554
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,480
heavy defoliation

555
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
i've seen some commercial facilities

556
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,880
strip them totally naked to where i

557
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,960
would freak out like i if i was the uh

558
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
director of cultivation in that place

559
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,558
i'd be writing people up and we'd be

560
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
taking a class and it might be working

561
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,879
for them but dude it scares me to see

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
that sometimes then it says uh what do

563
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
you do in your garden when you're

564
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,679
growing for flower maybe you could talk

565
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,079
about the dangers of overdoing it and

566
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,240
going a bit easier and non-synthetic

567
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,159
garden systems i don't think that

568
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
synthetic and non-synthetic really makes

569
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,558
a difference in how much you defoliate i

570
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,038
think it's more about the genetics

571
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:28,798
environment your goal uh mainly the

572
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,319
environment and the natural leafiness of

573
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,839
the plant is that a thing the leafiness

574
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,159
the natural amount of leaves that that

575
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,759
plant makes also some nutrients make a

576
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
lot of leaves not as many leaves from

577
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,599
some newts more nudes from another so a

578
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,879
lot of things could factor into this and

579
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,798
a lot of things could factor into how

580
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
many leaves you take off some people

581
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,480
don't take off any leaves some people

582
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
insist that those leaves are there as

583
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,079
solar panels and they're feeding the

584
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,599
plants uh we're feeding the plants into

585
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,678
the root zone i'm spending a lot of

586
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,119
money on bottled nutrients mixing it up

587
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
pouring it into the root zone they're

588
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,000
eating from there i could tell because

589
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,279
the leaf tips are burnt uh we don't have

590
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
to worry about feeding the plant from

591
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,240
the leaves as much

592
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,919
they do work as solar panels you'll

593
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,759
learn if you start watching you'll see

594
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
when you remove a leaf you'll see where

595
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,200
the more leaves pop up and how it moves

596
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,038
the growth you'll start to learn that

597
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
but over doing it is one of the things

598
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,400
you asked about

599
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
maybe you could talk about the dangers

600
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
of overdoing it yeah you could overdo it

601
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,079
i mentioned it if you over strip them

602
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
those plants just might not recover they

603
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,000
might not spit out more leaves you may

604
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,359
have slowed them down burned them out so

605
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,679
my advice there is if you're going to

606
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,918
start schwasing stripping heavily

607
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,519
defoliating new plants if you're in

608
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,799
control and you've got multiple plants

609
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,079
of the same strain which hopefully

610
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,000
you're running multiple plants of the

611
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,079
same strain so we can do an experiment

612
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,240
strip one and a level one strip one at

613
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,079
level two strip one at level three and

614
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,759
continue all the way till one's naked so

615
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,839
you can do some experiments if you don't

616
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,000
have enough to do a lot of anomalies do

617
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,678
one a little bit one extreme and see

618
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,839
what you like better that's how we learn

619
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,400
these plants you guys i am not some sort

620
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,639
of magical wizard i am a jedi i am a

621
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,280
ninja but i'm not a wizard i don't have

622
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,799
any magical uh i don't have a magic wand

623
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,639
or anything like that i've grown a lot

624
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,079
of plants and i've tried a lot of [ __ ]

625
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,559
that's how i know what works and what

626
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,158
doesn't work i know that when i do this

627
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,599
and i do this to plants right next to

628
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,679
each other i can take notes and i can

629
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,879
see what works best and then i can say

630
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,720
shouldn't do that again or should do

631
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,480
that again then i've done a lot of those

632
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,400
experiments a lot of comparisons a lot

633
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,640
of uh tests a lot of trials a lot of

634
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,240
tribulations i've done full episodes

635
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,159
about mistakes you guys i have killed

636
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,759
plants i have killed i've cut down [ __ ]

637
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,520
in the middle because i wasn't happy

638
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,359
i've killed stuff don't don't think that

639
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,158
i'm a [ __ ] perfection a perfect

640
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,240
grower i'm no wizard um i may be a jedi

641
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,840
but i'm not a perfect grower but i've

642
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
done a lot of experimenting i've tried a

643
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,199
lot of things and that's how i've

644
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
learned what does and what does not work

645
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,679
sometimes you got to try different

646
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
things in different rooms in different

647
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,798
spaces sometimes you have to get

648
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,240
creative and inventive sometimes the

649
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,158
things that work for me won't work for

650
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
you and your grow sometimes it what

651
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,480
works for mike at mike's grow or bill at

652
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
bills grow will not work at jack and
