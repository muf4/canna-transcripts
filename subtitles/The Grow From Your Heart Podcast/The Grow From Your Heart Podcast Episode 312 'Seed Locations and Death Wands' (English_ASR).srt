00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,150
letting you know what I'm smoking on

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,489
today I'm taking dabs of Apollo 13 live

30
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,990
batter from our friends at apothecary

31
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,869
farms in Colorado Springs

32
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:13,849
you guys this concentrate smells amazing

33
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,859
I always thought Apollo 13 had sort of a

34
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:18,049
funky smell and when they made it into a

35
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,879
concentrate it definitely brought out

36
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,450
that funky smell there is sort of like a

37
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:25,759
a rotten mangoes or a filthy apricot

38
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,500
with some dirty peaches on it it's got a

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,270
rotten fruit sort of a smell sort of

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,700
like you're making some some bum wine

41
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:34,310
some prison hooch that's like the very

42
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,200
start of that funky fermentation process

43
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,030
and honestly I love that smell there's

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,159
just something about fermented funk that

45
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,140
I kind of enjoy and this really hits

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
that note when you smoked it that

47
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,260
fermented funk flavor doesn't come

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,329
through it comes through more like a

49
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,580
sweet funky sort of a thing and I

50
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,890
actually enjoyed that and then the the

51
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,480
head-high is just tremendous you guys my

52

62
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,039
been listening to the show for a while

63
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,260
you've been hearing me

64
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,179
about making more lemon Jeffery and more

65
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,009
golden goat feminized seeds that's right

66
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,200
I am the creator of the strain lemon

67
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,239
Jeffrey and I also made the golden goat

68
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,608
into feminized seeds I did not invent or

69
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,140
create the golden goat I simply put it

70
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:31,239
into feminized seeds please don't give

71
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,738
me credit for that the lemon Jeffrey

72
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,480
however is my creation

73
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,340
those are both made from a reversed

74
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,979
golden goat I take a girl golden goat

75
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,289
plant I reverse it I turn it into a boy

76
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:43,149
that makes female pollen then I put that

77
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:44,679
pollen on more golden goat plants and

78
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,629
then I put that pollen on more lemon

79
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,489
skunk plants and then I create golden

80
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:50,828
goat feminized seeds and I create lemon

81
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,530
Jeffrey feminized seeds lemon Jeffrey is

82
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:55,959
one of my most popular strains it is a

83
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,930
super sativa with a super lemon flavor

84
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,489
and it harvests very heavy harvest it

85
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,189
has been a huge hit and I haven't made

86
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,049
seeds of that in several years so it is

87
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:07,449
time to make more lemon Jeffrey seeds

88
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,769

95

108
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,840
company I recently put a name to one of

109
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,789
my new crosses that's right I've had a

110
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,039
cross that is needed a name for quite

111
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:52,388
some time I've been racking my brain and

112
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,298
bugging all of my friends about what to

113
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:56,409
name it I have finally settled on a name

114
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,379
the strain that I've been trying to name

115
00:03:56,408 --> 00:04:01,090
of course was star dog to arise there

116
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:04,418
were many great options I narrowed it

117
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,908
down to a star breaker because it was

118
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,439
star dog to arise and arise as day

119
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,878
breaker and golden goat so there was day

120
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:12,489
breaker in there so I wanted to call it

121
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,698
star breaker also somebody in my

122
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,259
Instagram live feed dropped the name

123
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,579
starstruck as soon as they said star

124
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,658
struck I think I knew that that was

125
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,120
gonna be the name but I wanted to

126
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:23,860
hesitate because I got super excited but

127
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,478
since they said that I've known since

128
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,699
then that the name of that strain was

129
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,079
starstruck so starting to arise is

130
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,759

opportunity for a rap verse and that's

176
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,449
always where mr. mojo drops in he walks

177
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,979
up to the front of the stage there was

178
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,360
not a nice clean rap and then walks

179
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,780
right back to his percussion and keeps

180
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,389
going also in the band is Gramps Morgan

181
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:16,879
Gramps Morgan is another giant man with

182
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,479
giant dreadlocks and a giant smile also

183
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:23,120
a giant heart and a giant voice grabs

184
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,800
Morgan plays keyboards when it's his

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,199
turn to sing he walks out to the front

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,389
of the stage and he sings with this

187
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,870
super low voice and this big giant smile

188
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,120
and the ladies just go crazy for Gramps

189
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,550
Morgan and that giant voice that comes

190
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,780
out of that man sometimes he'll like

191
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,610
look at the little crowd like all right

192
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,709
if you don't quit scream and I can't

193
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,080
sing cuz nobody can hear me and he loves

194
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,579
it he milks the crowd he's he's got huge

195
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,740
stage presence and he knows it

196
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,379
and he plays it very well so that's

197
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,180
Gramps Morgan he he's a ladies man he

198
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,219
makes the ladies go crazy I also love

199
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,949
the way the man sings he's got such a

200
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,750
soulful style to him he's always wearing

201
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,860
his sunglasses indoors cuz I'm sure his

202
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,319
eyes are super red he's just a big happy

203
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,240
joyful Rasta man next to them is his

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,040
brother PETA Morgan PETA Morgan's kind

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,910
of a small guy he's not as huge as the

206
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,560
other two but

207
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,939
he's got a huge presence he has a

208
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,009
silky-smooth Michael Jackson reggae

209
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,959
voice and I think it's awesome he sings

210
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,969
the high parts you got Gramps over there

211
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,189
doing the lows and then he got Peter up

212
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,350
there doing the highs and it just the

213
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,180
way that it they they contrast each

214
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,160
other is perfect they contrast they

215
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,079
harmonized they match it worked so well

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,210
also there's a backup singer named

217
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,759
Natasha that sounds a lot like Peeta

218
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:42,149
they blend very well together but Peter

219
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,849
Morgan has this really great he's got a

220
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,609
very neat accent his patois accent is

221
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,500
very thick and it comes out very neat

222
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,350
when he gets fired up and gets going and

223
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,600
he's so passionate the three brothers

224
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,510
and the backup singer natasha together

225
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,920
have such a great harmonious feel to

226
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,539
them they could come out and just sing

227
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,819
without instruments and I think it would

228
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,740
be a great show the Morgan brothers

229
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,849
along with Oona Morgan their sister had

230
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,129
been singing together since they were

231
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,629
children so they've got a really tight

232
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,069
vibe to him and they can just look at

233
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,930
each other and know what songs are gonna

234
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,420
play they don't even have to talk and

235
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,280
Natasha's been on tour with them for two

236
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,189
or three years now so she's really

237
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,929
fallen and I see her finding her space

238
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,129
she knows little drum parts now there

239
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,439
will be drum fills that she does that

240
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,670
she air drums to the fills I've seen in

241
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,889
this band a lot you guys if you can't

242
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,629
tell but the vibe that this band brings

243
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,129
is amazing because they're a family and

244
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,080
they've been together for years and they

245
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,179
just bring such a good family vibe and

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,219
their well-rehearsed and their harmonies

247
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,829
are so strong and natasha is falling in

248
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,510
perfectly I love it also there's another

249
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,660
singer that joins them

250
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:47,639
Gramps Morgan's son Jumeirah Morgan is

251
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,949
an up-and-coming reggae star he's got an

252
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,639
album out he comes and sings a couple of

253
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,340
songs with them

254
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,350
Jimmy Ruiz always great but they would

255
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,690
be awesome without the band is what I

256
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,029
said a moment ago but they do bring an

257
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,940
amazing backup band they bring a bass

258
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,309

259

not sure his name he is an awesome

261
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,820
drummer he's kind of uh you could call

262
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:13,980
him maybe the Tony royster or maybe the

263
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,420
Tony royster jr. of reggae music he

264
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,700
looks like Tony Royster and he plays

265
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,409
with that uh aggressive movement and

266
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,850
that non-stop action and he makes a

267
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:22,889
bunch of great funny faces which I

268
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,050
really love in a drummer there guitar

269
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,830
player is great in a reggae band you

270
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,209
don't really need a

271
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,650
show-off of a guitar player you need a

272
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,180
guy that can keep a solid rhythm and

273
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,829
then throw down a solo when it's needed

274
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,539
and the guy they've got does that

275
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,920
perfectly right now he's been on tour

276
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,379
with them for quite a while he's

277
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,659
recorded with them they fit together so

278
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,639
well they've got a keyboard player same

279
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,899
story is the guitarist you just need a

280
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,669
guy that can hold the rhythm and

281
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,740
remember all of the songs and all of the

282
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,779
changes and pull off a solo it needed

283
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,759
their keyboard player can also throw out

284
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,470
some rap verses there are one or two

285
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,970
songs where he'll grab a mic and run up

286
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,350
to the front of the stage and spit out a

287
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,120
rap verse and then run back to the

288
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,920
keyboards and keep playing so that's

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,049
always fun when your guys can add more

290
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,610
stuff to the show so yeah Morgan

291
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:04,139
heritage just has a bunch of great

292
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,720
musicians a bunch of great singers

293
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,879

294
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,500
good vibe I always leave there with such

295
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,129
good energy and I always feel so

296
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,559
refreshed

297
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:16,049
so Morgan heritage was awesome also the

298
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,939
show was opened by there were a couple

299
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,529
acts that I didn't make it on time for I

300
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,150
had to leave work had to come home get

301
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,009
cleaned up drive out of town and get

302
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,449
there anything parking took for freaking

303
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,740
ever and then getting into the show so I

304
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,560
missed a couple of the opening acts but

305
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,750
I did catch a new up-and-coming artist

306
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,639
by the name of Anna Lee brown a very

307
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,820
beautiful young lady from the islands

308
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,460
who's sang like an angel she had some

309
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,490
poppy reggae type stuff that I was

310
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,000
really enjoying also there was a group

311
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,639
that was fronted by a man by the name of

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Fiji I have never seen Fiji live until

313
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,480
that night I hadn't even heard that much

314
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,910
of him until I saw Morgan Heritage was

315
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,509
going on tour with them apparently

316
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:59,819
in Hawaii Fiji is super popular and

317
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,100
apparently in Colorado Springs we have a

318
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,379
big gathering of people from Hawaii

319
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,720
there's a large community of Hawaiian or

320
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,299
Islanders in Colorado Springs I was not

321
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,200
aware of that because this guy Fiji and

322
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:14,639
his brother Maui come to do reggae and

323
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,259
everybody from the islands and everybody

324
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,909
from the island community that lives in

325
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,980
Springs they all filled the black sheep

326
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,199
you guys I've never seen the black sheep

327
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,490
this fool for a Morgan heritage show

328
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,830
last year when I went to see Morgan

329
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,320
heritage there there were maybe 30 to 50

330
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,480
maybe 75 people in the entire club

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,140
during Morgan Heritage's set this time

332
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,360
the place was sold out it was packed

333
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:39,208
people knew all of the words to Fiji and

334
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,649
this his friend Maui they knew

335
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,328
all the words these guys have songs they

336
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,028
also knew all the words to Anna Lee

337
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:46,828
Brown songs I have never heard of these

338
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:50,009
bands before but the Islanders knew

339
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:51,748
every word I really liked the way that

340
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,688
guy Fiji gets down that dude's got some

341
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:57,089
soul he's a big dude uh he can sing high

342
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:59,099
he can sing low and he also isn't afraid

343
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,689
to get silly on stage he he'll crack

344
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,040
himself up in the middle of a song and

345
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:04,438
have some fun which I really enjoy

346
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,868
seeing an artist do another thing that I

347
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:09,688
really enjoyed was the band that backs

348
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:14,040
up Fiji and Maui they come on stage and

349
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:18,028
they play a pre-recorded Polynesian

350
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,769
sounding soundtrack and it may I'm not

351
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,480
sure what it was honestly I have never

352
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,938
heard anything like that before it was

353
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,129
intense and it was very mean but when

354
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:27,928
that ends the band goes into an

355
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,389
instrumental and they play an

356
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:32,970
instrumental really intense instrumental

357
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:35,278
jam while Fiji and Maui walk out onto

358
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,509
the stage and then once the singers get

359
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,159
out onto the stage they start doing a

360
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,470
chant and I don't want to sound

361
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,899
defensive but they say it's Hawaiian

362
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,028
words and it's short sentences and it's

363
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,759
just like doodle doo de doo de doo duh

364
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,708
and then the crowd responds with like

365
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,778
just quick words back didn't little aah

366
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,969
and then [ __ ] the band did it again

367
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,740
no no no no no what Ana and then the

368
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,629
crowd responded back who Dena who Dena

369
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,490
and I have no idea what the [ __ ] going

370
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:07,889
on you guys there were like 50 or 75

371
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,419
Polynesian people surrounding me and I

372
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,610
was the tallest person in the front row

373
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:12,808
by like an entire foot and they all knew

374
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,919
what was happening and I was just kind

375
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,600
of looking around like wow this is

376
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,979
[ __ ] amazing it was really neat it

377
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,028
was really intense I was also high as

378
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,829
giraffe [ __ ] that may have had

379
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:22,409
something to do with it but this went on

380
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:23,909
for two or three solid minutes and then

381
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,558
at the end of it the guy ended it with

382
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,328
like a really high one he's like winning

383
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:30,208
nine and I week and then they all did

384
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:32,159
this really high-pitched thing and they

385
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,808
stopped instantly like altogether and

386
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,909
then the band took off playing reggae

387
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:37,889
music it was really intense it was

388
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:39,958
really beautiful as really neat I've

389
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,759
never seen anything like it so if you

390
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,768
get the chance you guys go see Fiji and

391
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,659
Maui they were [ __ ] awesome and

392
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,308
always go see Morgan heritage reggae

393
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,139
music just makes me feel so good if you

394
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:51,208
can't tell by the enthusiasm in my voice

395
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,470

396

397
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,480

I also need to get some water so I'm

399
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320

400
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,669
it when I play reggae music but I'm

401

425
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,388
dank seed bank about your blueberry

426
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,490
cookies crosses I haven't heard you talk

427
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,110
about this on the podcast I know you've

428
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,000
had trouble in the past with genetic

429
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,850
labeling with this company I was

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,948
wondering if this is your genetics first

431
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,528
off yes those are my genetics those are

432
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:45,939
my blueberry cookies feminized crosses

433
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:50,049
I've been talking about that a little

434
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,910
bit on the show recently also the hella

435
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:54,219
dank seed company is not who was miss

436
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:57,429
labeling my stuff it was the dank team

437
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,259
the dank team.com was getting bulk seeds

438
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:01,359
and then just inventing a name for them

439
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,588
strains that I hadn't named yet they

440
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
were just putting a name on it

441
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,818
so the hella dank seed company is

442
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,500
totally cool they have never done me

443
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,230
wrong they've never mislabeled anything

444
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,359
I fully support and endorse them those

445
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,160
are my seeds that they've got I no

446
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,990
longer do business with the vendor that

447
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,640
was changing my names so when they run

448
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,160
out of my seeds they won't be able to

449
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,900
advertise that they've got any of my

450
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,370
products they won't be able to give out

451
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,829
any of my freebies and they certainly

452
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,039
will not be able to change any of my

453
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:32,440
strain names or invent names for me so I

454
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,029
fully endorse and fully support the hell

455
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,690
a dank seed company they've never done

456
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,269
me wrong

457
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,250
those are my blueberry cookies crosses

458
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,900

459
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,298
quickly so make sure you grab them while

460
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,840

464
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,730
good work I don't have a question then

465
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,990
he says wait I do have a question

466
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,279
and it's a really good question too so

467
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,990
I'm glad you came up with this he says

468
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,539
do you map where you get the seeds off

469
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,240
of the plant like do you save main stock

470
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:09,279
seeds lower plant seeds and upper Kola

471
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,500
seeds do you map where you take them off

472
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,950
of the plant because I feel when I run

473
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,079
main stock seeds I get Cup winners my

474
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,529
patients feedback is that they are a lot

475
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:22,509
more potent than bud seeds if you do use

476
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,410
the question on your podcast you can use

477

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,779
they were calling the tour the island

492
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:54,969
vibes tour so everybody is an Islander

493
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,740
and they brought such a great vibe I

494
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,809
feel like I owe you guys some love back

495
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,120
so much love much respect out to the

496
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:03,970
islands I hope you guys are well let's

497
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,789
answer the question honestly no I have

498
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,400
never thought about mapping where the

499
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,379
seeds came from on the plant I've always

500
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,330
been so excited just to get all of the

501
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,800
seeds out so that I could count them and

502
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,299
package them up and then give them out

503
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,539
to people that I've never thought to pay

504
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,700
attention to where the actual seed came

505
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:25,240
from on which part of the plant I think

506
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,640
I'm going to set aside a plant and do

507
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,529
that myself when I clean the seeds next

508
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,210
time I'm gonna cut the top bud off and

509
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,799
then I'll cut the bottom buds off and

510
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,240
then I'll go and get the buds that are

511
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,710
right next to the stick I know what you

512
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,210
mean when you go up that top but a bunch

513
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,250
of this a bunch of the seeds are gonna

514
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,410
be right up the stem so I'll set those

515
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,269
aside and then I'll set the top buds

516
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,950
that have the seeds I'll set those aside

517
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,779
and then the bottom buds I'll set those

518
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,279
aside and then I'm gonna germinate some

519
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,259
of them and I'll grow them and see if

520
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,660
they perform differently and I'll take

521
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,690
notes of it because that could be that

522
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,200
could be very helpful that could help

523
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,298
the breeder speed up the entire Fino

524
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,788
hunt process if I know which seeds are

525
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,589
going to give me the winner plants that

526
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:06,538
are going to be more likely to give me

527
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,128
the champions if I already know which

528
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,598
tool box to reach into to get the

529
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:11,428
appropriate tool then that'll speed up

530
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:14,308
my breeding that's going to help me

531
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:15,840
it'll help everybody now I'm sure that

532
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,190
there's some hater out there already

533
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,048
going he's just gonna keep all those

534
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,690
good seeds for himself and send us all

535
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:24,058
the crappy ones no don't worry ah there

536
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,470
are so many seeds that even if I wanted

537
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,319
to do that it would be pointless

538
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,450
I couldn't grow all of those seeds from

539
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,658
one plant by myself and I have already

540
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,429
got such a hoard such a collection such

541
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,559
a catalog such a back stock of other

542
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,149
seeds that you do not have to worry

543
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,460
about me keeping the good ones for

544
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,939
myself I want you guys to have the good

545
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,220
ones

546
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,808
I'll get ten or twenty of them and I'll

547
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,950
be just fine that's all I need I don't

548
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,058
want the rest to go to you so don't

549
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,569
think I'm gonna keep the best ones for

550
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:52,769
myself if I do learn how to identify

551
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,658
those seeds hey that's a great idea

552
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:56,220

done by a guy named mr. dank

589
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,640
I got the clone from a friend that

references in the past week that's been

593
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,190

and I loved it so I bred with it ah but

595
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,360
shout out to golden goat uh he also says

596
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,640
was curious what your thoughts are on

597
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,919
the pathogen death wands I hear so much

598
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,410
about from California growers I'm

599
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:34,190
experienced pyramiding with a 1000 watt

600
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:37,490
HPS and an infrared UV LED as a cheaper

601
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,860
alternative the death wand sounds like

602
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,109
it's too good to be true and costs 500

603
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,419
to 800 dollars a piece I can't justify

604
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,509
that expense so I'm making my own from

605
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,710
LED strands and different light

606
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:50,660
spectrums and then he said thanks again

607
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,819
and then he signed his name and I'm not

608
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,410
sure if he wants that said so I'm not

609
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:56,269
gonna share that out of respect

610
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,380
hey dude thanks for the great email you

611
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:58,519
guys if you'd like to send me an email

612
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,620
let's grow from your heart at

613
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,910
hotmail.com I'd love to hear from you I

614
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:05,509
would love to answer your questions

615
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:08,240
let's talk about pathogen death wands

616
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:10,099
what he's talking about you guys it kind

617
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,720
of looks like a lightsaber there are

618
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:13,189
different versions of them available it

619
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,380
looks like a lightsaber with the shield

620
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,880
over one end of it so that that way the

621
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,100
light doesn't shine into your face from

622
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,790
that direction I kind of looks like one

623
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:23,809
of those like a bug light sort of it's

624
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,069
got a handle there are different

625
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,799
versions but the one I'm familiar with

626
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:30,109
plugs into the wall it's got a handle on

627
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,119
it that you would kind of hold sort of

628
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,889
like the weed eater like if you're gonna

629
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,019
do the weed eater it holds the handle is

630
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,150
kind of shaped like that and then it's

631
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:40,190
got basically a small light reflector on

632
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,820
it with a light bulb inside of it and

633
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,470
that is a UV light inside of there and

634
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:48,169
what that light does is it destroys

635
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,990
powdery mildew that UV light breaks down

636
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,610
powdery mildew almost instantly and so

637
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,259
what growers will do is they will plug

638
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,269
in this light and you've got to wear

639
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:58,490
protective eyewear they sell you certain

640
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,250
glasses with this light you have to wear

641
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:04,490
those glasses and do not by any means

642
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,559
ever look into your death wand it is

643
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:10,009
called a [ __ ] death wand if you look

644
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,579
into it your eyes are toast okay you

645
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:15,289
will go blind this thing is not a joke

646
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:16,519
so be really serious about this there

647
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,129
are a lot of things we play with in the

648
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,379
grow that can hurt us this one you will

649
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,370
instantly feel the effects you will be

650
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,890
[ __ ] blind

651
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:26,329
no more fortnight all right think about

652
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,950
that all right I don't play video games

653
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,808
but everyone's stuck on fortnight right

654
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,519
now if you [ __ ] up with the pathogen

655
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:33,109
death Wan and look into it you don't get

656
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,269
to play fortnight anymore all right

657
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:37,549
think about that so the pathogen death

658
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,139
wand they're making them with that's a

659
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,750
UV light they're putting different types

660
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,490
of lights in them you hold it it's got

661
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,289
this handle like I explained it's got

662
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,700
the reflector coming off of it and then

663
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:49,009
it's got a light that shines down and

664
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,900
you just simply walk down the rows of

665
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,730
plants and just shine this light over

666
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,130
the canopy and try to get the light on

667
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,029
each leaf surface you don't touch it you

668
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,580
shine it over it

669
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:00,500
you go about 10 to 14 inches away and

670
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,089
you just hover that light above every

671
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,099
single leaf and you try to get it over

672
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:05,149
each leaf for about one to two seconds

673
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:07,549
if you go too long

674
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,800
it will kind of wrinkle and burn the

675
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,779
leaves if you stay there too long so I

676
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,579
would pick a spot that you can get to

677
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,319
and just shine the light over there and

678
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,539
then just start walking down that row

679
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,980
and then finish that row and then go to

680
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,299
the other side of the table and walk up

681
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,069
that row and then if you can't get to

682
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,409
the middle maybe reach your arm out real

683
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:26,569
far maybe hang it on a pole or something

684
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,580
put it on a PVC pipe or a 2x4 and just

685
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:30,649
get it a little extension just do your

686
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:32,449
best to get over the entire canopy you

687
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,269
want to get that light over each and

688
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,650
every leaf of that whole canopy don't

689
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,509
ever do it while the plants are wet you

690
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,280
guys if you've got morning dew or if

691
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:42,769
you've applied not the strain morning

692
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,539
dew actual morning dew like some do in

693
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:46,549
the morning some moisture or if you've

694
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,289
sprayed the plants or if it's rained or

695
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:50,299
something like that don't shine this UV

696
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,159
light over any moisture bubbles because

697
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,289
that's gonna give you problems but just

698
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,509
simply walk the rows and shine the light

699
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,399
over every single plant and that's going

700
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:59,750
to help you get rid of your powdery

701
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,080
mildew it's gonna help you get rid of

702
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,900
other spores and pathogens the problem

703
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:08,480
is the one that you were making I'm not

704
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,730
sure it is going to be the correct

705
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,319
spectrum and the correct lighting the

706
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,808
reason they're so expensive is because

707
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,639
they're using the UV light and the

708
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:19,039
infrared lighting and those are

709
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,230
expensive hmm I understand you're trying

710
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,049
to save a few bucks but I'm not sure if

711
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,519
you're using the right spectrums I hope

712
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,558
it works let me know how it works for

713
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,710
you if you're already battling p.m. and

714
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:34,428
you run your thousand watt HPS and your

715
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,750
infrared and UV and LEDs oh if you run

716
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,269
that over there and it

717
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,650
your powdery mildew let me know how that

718
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,420
works because you're right those death

719
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,940
wands are somewhere I've seen them for

720
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,160
as low as $400 for a very entry level

721
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,720
one it would probably take you two weeks

722
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,090
to run that little light over your

723
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,220
entire garden and it's not super intense

724
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,109
you'd have to be at it every day but yes

725
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,720
they are super expensive I hope your

726
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:59,329
homemade MacGyver device works for you I

727
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,309
wish you the best of luck I understand

728
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:03,049
not being able to justify the expense at

729
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,149
the time but what you're gonna really

730
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,490
have to do is you're going to have to

731
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,310
figure out what is causing the powdery

732
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,319
mildew in your grow just simply treating

733
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,179
it with the death wand all the time is

734
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,379
not going to be effective you're gonna

735
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,130
find yourself in there way too

736
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,110
frequently

737
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,150
spending way too many man-hours trying

738
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,179
to fight this it's going to be more cost

739
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:25,880
effective to eliminate the problem find

740
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,070
the cause and correct that maybe you

741
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,170
need more HVAC maybe you need more

742
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:33,379
dehumidification maybe your vapor

743
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,210
pressure deficit is off maybe it's too

744
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,490
hot maybe it's too cold maybe you have

745
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,079
too far of a swing in there do you have

746
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,880
something in that room that is letting

747
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,829
you know what your temperatures are

748
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,330
constantly I know we've all got the

749
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,399
hygrometer that hangs in the room the

750
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,439
hygrometer thermometer combo bill lets

751
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,600
you know how hot it got and how cool it

752
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,880
got but does it tell you for how long

753
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,709
and when it happened we need something

754
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,210
that lets us know what's going on in the

755
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,100
grow so find out what's happening in

756
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,470
there I bet your problem is happening

757
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:02,509
right when the lights go off that's

758
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,339
usually the temperatures drop the

759
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:06,140
humidity goes real high because all that

760
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:08,750
moisture is in the air you've got all

761
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,060
that do in the air it's dark you're just

762
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,500
welcoming powdery mildew right then so

763
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:15,799
find out what's happening in your Gro

764
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,259
correct the issue then you will not have

765
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,990
to spend money on a death one you won't

766
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:23,329
have to spend hours on time walking

767
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,559
around a shining a light over plants it

768
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,789
doesn't feel like you're doing anything

769
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,069
when you do it I've used one of these

770
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,049
things before and another grow it did

771
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,279
not feel like anything was happening I

772
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,899
could see that the powdery mildew would

773
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,549
disappear but you're just walking around

774
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,320
shining a light it feels like such a

775
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,149
waste of time when there are such other

776
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,659
important things to be done in a

777
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,820
commercial grow so I hope this does work

778
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,460
for you you asked about my thoughts they

779
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,500
do work if you buy the appropriate death

780
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,519
wand it will work for you they actually

781
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,529
make

782
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,599
i'ts out of the same UV and infrared

783
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,730
that go inside of your HVAC equipment

784
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,469
that will work to kill the spores and

785
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,509
the HVAC as well they're quite expensive

786
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,400
to install but they're constantly

787
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,319
running and anything that passes through

788
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,940
your HVAC system will then be killed it

789
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,329
will not even make it to your grow room

790
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,799
there are other alternatives that aren't

791
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,169
as expensive but the first thing you

792
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,930
need to do is correct the issue in the

793
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:18,200
grow room so figure out what's causing

794
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,000
the problem find a solution and then

795
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,009
implement that solution and hopefully

796
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,529
you can stop having powdery mildew and

797
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:27,890
then the pathogen death wand is sort of

798
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,930
like a that's like taking cough medicine

799
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,340
what we need to do is take better care

800
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,750
of ourselves so that we don't get a

801
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:35,059
coffee you know what I'm saying you're

802
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,130
out there with a cold we've got to make

803
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:38,269
sure that we don't get a cold again so

804
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,760
let's figure out what caused the problem

805
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:43,819
let's implement a solution in the

806
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,460
meantime I hope your makeshift death

807
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:48,079
wand works out for you I am curious how

808
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,509
it works because we could save a lot of

809
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,240
people a lot of money if they don't have

810
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:55,339
to spend the five to $800 on the

811
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,900
horticultural death wand hey dude I

812
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:58,879
really do appreciate this email I look

813
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,710

864
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,990
you to promote my show or the best way

865
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:51,389
to promote a podcast in general my

866
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,099
answer is gonna kind of be the same the

867
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,920
best way to promote your podcast is just

868
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:58,289
to focus on putting out quality content

869
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,500
people hear podcasts and when they hear

870
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,329
it

871
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,349
mmm excuse the throat clearing you guys

872
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:05,669
hold on for just one quick second

873
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:07,289
alright so people hear quality content

874
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,460
now when they hear it they like it and

875
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:10,170
they talk about it and they tell their

876
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,700
friends and then their friends listen to

877
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,950
it and their friends do the same thing

878
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,990
the best way that I have found

879
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,569
to advertise and promote a podcast is

880
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,400
just to focus on doing a quality show

881
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,200
and the show will promote itself the

882
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,700
more people listen the more you get

883
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,990
moved up in iTunes the more you get

884
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,549
moved up in stitcher and then more

885
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,099
people listen don't worry about

886
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,750
promoting don't worry about advertising

887
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:33,329
focus on your job which is doing a

888
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,700
quality show and a quality product will

889
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:37,139
sell itself that's what I think I think

890
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,759
a little bit of Instagram a little bit

891
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,630
of social media is good for you but

892
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,750
don't overdo it

893
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,460
don' don't get too caught up trying to

894
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,710
be relevant to where you push yourself

895
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,299
out of being relevant do your job and

896
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,700
things will come the way that they're

897
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,839
supposed to so that's what I say the

898
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,840
best way if you want to promote your

899
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,669
podcast light social media maybe just

900
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,740
word of mouth and do a great show the

901
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,090
best way to promote my podcast just say

902
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,130
hey listen to the girl from your heart

903
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:04,559

910
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,289

913
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,609
let's smoke cannabis dot-com let's move

914
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,619
up and see the rest of the questions he

915
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,029
said he's a new grower and a new podcast

916
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,989
host hey keep it up man it sounds like

917
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,809
you're off to a good start on the

918
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,900
podcast I actually have listened YouTube

919
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,849
you to is not they will accept my

920
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,650
submissions with other people's music

921
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,269
but I cannot monetize it and they give

922
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,720
me little strikes against my account for

923
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,789
copyright violations my resolution has

924
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,620
been to create my own opening and

925
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:51,809
closing music and not play other

926
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,609
people's music on the show of course I

927
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:55,379
[ __ ] that all up on this episode because

928
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:58,199
I couldn't resist and I had to play some

929
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,510
organ heritage for you but this episode

930
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,130
simply won't be monetized honestly I

931
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:03,390
don't make a penny off of my youtube

932
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,240
channel because I don't get enough views

933
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,800
for that so it doesn't even matter if I

934
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,150
were Joe Rogan or something that would

935
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,980
make a huge difference to me

936
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,170
I'm sure Rogan makes thousands of

937
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,630
dollars per YouTube episode and I don't

938
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,539
make pennies so I don't mind losing the

939
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,829
monetization of one show that wouldn't

940
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,340
gotten paid anything anyway so that's

941
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,840
alright

942
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,760
that's just my way around it they'll let

943
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,260
the episodes go up I just can't monetize

944
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,280
it and they give me a little copyright

945
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,010
strikes and they let me know that

946
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,200
they're looking we have to be careful as

947
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,880
a cannabis community because right now

948
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,189
YouTube is taking down all of the

949
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,740
cannabis channels so hopefully I survive

950
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,168
hopefully let's smoke cannabis survives

951
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,029
but anyway that's well that was my

952
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:44,339
resolution as I just made my own music

953
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,200
and I try to refrain from using copy

954
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,750
written music that is not owned by

955
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,939
myself another thing that you could do

956
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,909
is you could record your episode and

957
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,559
then you can add the music and post it

958
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,149
to iTunes and then you could go however

959
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,650
you're recording I use GarageBand I

960
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,900
would go into GarageBand and just delete

961
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,599
the music track and then post that file

962
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,190
to YouTube instead of using the music

963
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,809
part so it's a little bit different

964
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,340
experience for the different listeners

965
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,929
but that's alright because nobody will

966
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,910
know unless they listen on two different

967
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:14,009
platforms and they'll just be missing

968
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,989
music but my recommendation would just

969
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,760
be to either make your own song or

970
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,229
recruit somebody with the proper

971
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,990
software and the time and skills to make

972
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,460
a song for you you can pay people to do

973
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:25,589
it there are services where you can go

974
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,000
and have them create a custom jingle for

975
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,070
you I'm not sure if that's in your

976
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,690
budget I haven't considered doing that
