00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,299
of supporting the podcast I am seeking

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,340
questions for an upcoming episode that's

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,840
right I'm going to do an episode where I

43
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,840
eat too many Edibles and I answer

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,759
questions that are non-grow related

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,380
that's right I don't try to abandon the

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,478
grow questions on patreon but I'm going

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,920
to do a patreon only episode I'm going

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,078
to eat too many Edibles and I want to

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,060
answer questions uh mainly kind of about

50
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,859
me about my company anything you want to

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,540
ask me that is not grow related this is

52
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,399
a good time to ask that so if you've got

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,439
a question now is a good time to join

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,060
the patreon send those questions to the

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,519
patreon campaign and I will work those

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,080
in to the upcoming edible episodes where

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,239
I do eat too many Edibles and answer

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,379
personal questions is kind of the idea

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,480
that I'm going for it could be personal

60
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,919
questions it could be questions about

61
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,539
dreadlocks it could be questions about

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,738
shoes you know that I'm into sneakers

63
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,479
there could be questions about music

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,400
anything you want to know that is not

65
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,318
cannabis related this is the format for

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,239
those questions so please do join the

67
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:28,560
patreon and send me those questions on

68
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,780
patreon because I'm going through the

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,340
patreon to do the episode that is where

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,020
I'll get the questions from I look

71
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,000
forward to that I am also looking

72
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,739
forward to my Greenhouse filled with

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,539
seeds being harvested here within the

74
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,459
next couple of weeks I was in the

75
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,378
greenhouse today looking around and the

76
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,060
seeds are coming along quite nicely the

77
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,439
seeds are getting hard if you have not

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,699
been paying attention I do have a

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,500
greenhouse somewhere that I will not

80
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,419
tell you where it is in that Greenhouse

81
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,219
I've done a little bit of breeding we

82
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,738
took a Jack the Ripper mail and put that

83
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,359
Jack the Ripper mail to 10 solid female

84
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,219
plants so there will be 10 Jack the

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,319
Ripper crosses some of which you are

86
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,300
familiar some of which will be brand new

87
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,339
uh just to tease you a little bit there

88
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,140
will be a platinum Tangy pollinated by

89
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,140
the Jack the Ripper there might be an LA

90
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,839
Kush and we may be making more blue

91
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,279
berry butcher out there in the outdoor

92
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,439
run can't say too much more I've already

93
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,419
said enough but I am getting excited the

94
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,979
plants are looking good the buds are

95
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,299
swollen the seeds are getting fat

96
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,560
they're getting hard we keep pulling

97
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,760
seeds out every couple of days and

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,739
giving them a squeeze they are getting

99
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,179
close within the next two weeks maybe

100
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,580
three weeks if the most of those will

101
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,379
come down it will take me a while to get

102
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,360
those processed packaged and out to you

103
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,799
but I will be sending out test seeds I

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,780
will be sending out a lot of new stuff

105
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,019

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,939

114
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:55,919
and dust from being outside too much

115
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,019
today that's all that's from excuse me

116
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,158
for that I'm talking about outdoor grows

117
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,599
I want to give a big shout out to a

118
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,519
friend I'm not going to say his name a

119
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,619
friend of mine got his plants stolen

120
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,719
from his outdoor grow if you've ever

121
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,340
heard me talk about outdoor growing I do

122
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,019
always say plant a few extra you've got

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,700
to plant one for the thieves one for the

124
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,560
bugs one for the animals one for the

125
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,060
weather then maybe plant a couple for

126
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,040
yourself and hopefully you will get one

127
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,720
or two of those at the end if you got

128
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,180
your plants your outdoor plants were

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,160
stolen this year I do send you love I do

130
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,019
have what is it condolences for you I do

131
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,180
have love and empathy for that so maybe

132
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,620
some sympathy uh be careful where you're

133
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,780
planting your plants you guys don't tell

134
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,879
anybody chances are it's an inside job

135
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,219
and your plants do get stolen or you did

136
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,540
not do enough security work it's usually

137
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,919
the plants right there at the corners

138
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,600
near the edge of the fence those go

139
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,819
first maybe don't plant right there

140
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,620
maybe be more discreet but be prepared

141
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,899
if you're growing Outdoors that [ __ ] is

142
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,160
going to potentially get stolen do you

143
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,478
have a strategy that you're going to

144
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,340
follow if somebody does come to take

145
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,258
your plants it's not up to me to tell

146
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,819
you what to do but keep in mind that you

147
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,560
can grow more plants next year if you

148
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,360
are not in jail so whatever you're going

149
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,399
to do be very careful protecting your

150
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,900
garden but now is the time people are

151
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,060

152
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,500
big plants look ready the people that

153
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,939
don't know they're not ready are going

154
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,560

155
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,418

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,520
that I wanted to ramble about is

166
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,079
something kind of silly just kind of

167
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,299
personal I think I've discovered over

168
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,399
the past couple of weekends that uh

169
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,199
cleaning cloners is probably my least

170
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,239
favorite task when it comes to growing

171
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,280
cannabis I love growing I love

172
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
transplanting I love doing all of the

173
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,119
work that comes the defoliation popping

174
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,620
twisting putting up the Nets cleaning

175
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,000
the rooms is even fun doing all the

176
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,340
reset all that work is fun even

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,379
packaging seeds is fun I do not like

178
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,659
cleaning cloners I use the easy cloner

179
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,519
clone machines and for some reason just

180
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,979
cleaning those is one of my least

181
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,899
favorite tasks let me know what your

182
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,639
least favorite Garden tasks are send me

183
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,839
an email send me a tweet let me know we

184
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,699

185
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,859

hotmail.com let me know what are your

189
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,478
least favorite Garden tasks maybe we can

190
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,799
find some way to make those more fun

191
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,359
make them better of course it's always

192
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,759
better when you got to grow from your

193
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,919
heart podcast rambling in your ear

194
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
enough rambling I did say that I was

195
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,299
going to read a message about selecting

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
nutrients here in this episode this

197
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,780
message came from our friend shotgun

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,780
Yoda on patreon big shout out to shotgun

199
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,978
Yoda the message goes a little bit like

200
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,559
this

201
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,599
how about an episode on how to pick the

202
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,360
correct nutrient line what are the

203
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,879
advantages and disadvantages of each

204
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,439
that is a really good question uh this

205
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,418
could be a really in-depth episode I'm

206
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,038
going to try to cover this kind of kind

207
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,500
of tight but you know how I get we will

208
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,000
get rambly let's get right into it there

209
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,740
are a few things to think about when it

210
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,038
comes to selecting nutrients the most

211
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,840
important ah maybe is availability is it

212
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,060
available can you get it where can you

213
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,739
get it can you get it sustainably is it

214
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,660
a one-time thing or is it readily

215
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,879
available do you have to order it online

216
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,500
is it an Amazon purchase is it a

217
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,240
purchase directly from the company or is

218
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,699
it available at your local grow store

219
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,139
which of those mean the most to you is

220
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,538
it available that's what's going to

221
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,579
matter the most can you get it because

222
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,500
if you pick a line if you research a

223
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,120
line and it's not even available what's

224
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,860
good you can't use it what's it going to

225
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,139
do for you so the most important part is

226
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,240
is that product is that line available

227
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,680
then one of the next things to think

228
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,019
about this may be important for more

229
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,660
people than others but the cost is this

230
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,098
product is this line line cost effective

231
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,319
you're going to have to feed the plants

232
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,659
for nine weeks of flour a few weeks of

233
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,460
veg is it going to be cost effective is

234
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,500
your return on your investment going to

235
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,299
be worth it sometimes some bottles are

236
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,098
super expensive Sometimes some bottles

237
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,620
are really affordable you've got to do

238
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,418
the math think about I'm buying a gallon

239
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,340
I need to use one ounce every time I

240
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,379
water how many waterings do you get per

241
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,418
bottle how many times per week do you

242
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,098
water how much product do you expect out

243
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,139
of that product at the end out of the

244
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,879
end of the Harvest do the math on that

245
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,000
with each bottle then you've also got to

246
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,560
factor in electricity the water that you

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,060
use you got to put in your time your

248
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,038
labor all of that stuff you got to pay

249
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,019
for trimmers you got to pay for scissors

250
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,000
factor in all of that stuff but think

251
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,399
about the cost of the nutrients are they

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,199
cost effective some Brands out there are

253
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,659
really expensive some Brands out there

254
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,400
are really affordable sometimes you get

255
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,099
what you pay for sometimes you are

256
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,679
paying for advertising colorful bottles

257
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,418
fancy labels expensive advertising

258
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,740
sometimes you're not really paying for

259
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,120
what you're getting so think about that

260
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,399
one when it comes to buying your

261
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,839
Products Research the brand research the

262
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,339
products you were thinking about buying

263
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,080
research the brand that makes those

264
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,459
products then research the other

265
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,959
products that they make and see where

266
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,759
they get their products from see where

267
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,799
they're sourcing their ingredients to

268
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,139
make your products some companies have

269
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,338
great ethics some do not think about if

270
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,620
you want to support companies like

271
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,120
Monsanto or Scots that is up to you you

272
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,500
can vote with your dollars you can spend

273
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,299
your money wherever you would like it's

274
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
none of my business but it is something

275
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,199
that you may want to think about you may

276
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,459
want to be aware of so cost is very

277
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
important here's something you may not

278
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,000
have thought about how about

279
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,859
sustainability are the products you are

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,500
purchasing or thinking about purchasing

281
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,360
causing problems to the world or is that

282
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,519
company doing something to prevent

283
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,200
damage to our Earth and our world we

284
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,060
only get one world we only get one Earth

285
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,440
it's up to us to not destroyed I know

286
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,419
that's my big hippie talk for the day

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,339
but are the nutrients and the products

288
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,379
you're buying for your grow are they

289
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,760
sustainable is that going to destroy the

290
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,320
Earth is this a product that we can

291
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,480
continue to buy and use for several

292
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,800
years is this a product is this a brand

293
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
that just appeared yesterday and made

294
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,519
disappear tomorrow I prefer to buy a

295
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,019
brand that's been around for a minute

296
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,399
that I know is going to be around so

297
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,860
that if I do fall in love with their

298
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,720
products I can get it forever so that's

299
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,278
another part of sustainability first

300
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,379
we've got environmental sustainability

301
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,480
then we've got company sustainability

302
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,759
are these products going to be around in

303
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,259
a few years if you grow the best herb

304
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,639
you've ever grown and that product's not

305
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,439
available next year you're going to be

306
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,299
frustrated so is it going to be

307
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
available the next thing I'm going to

308
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,599
talk about is compatibility are the

309
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,120
nutrients you were thinking about

310
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,339
purchasing compatible with your grow

311
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
style maybe you're growing hydroponic

312
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,160
maybe you're growing cocoa maybe you're

313
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,860
growing ebb and flow maybe you're doing

314
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,199
a living soil mix Maybe not maybe you're

315
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,180
doing a soilless mix maybe you're just

316
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
growing in old dirt you found in the

317
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,739
backyard are these nutrients compatible

318
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
with your grow style also another thing

319
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,399
to think about are these nutrients

320
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,300
compatible with each other that's

321
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,879
something we're going to talk about

322
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,740
later in the episode I prefer if a new

323
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,080
grower is selecting nutrients you pick

324
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,580
one brand and get what you need from

325
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,800
that line I don't don't recommend that

326
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,899
you go get a base from one company a

327
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,759
bloom booster from another a root tonic

328
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,220
from another a phosphorus thing from

329
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,019
another because those companies didn't

330
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,759
talk to each other and you may run the

331
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,839
risk of overlapping nutrients we're

332
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,100
going to talk more about that in the

333
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,899
future I think I've got that written

334
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,480
down the next thing that really matters

335
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,458
is results when you grew with these

336
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,200
nutrients were you satisfied with the

337
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,899
outcome of your product did your bud

338
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,459
look smell taste Burn smoke give you the

339
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,078
buzz that you were hoping for that you

340
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,759
spent all these weeks and all these

341
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,500
nutrients pouring into it did it work

342
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,059
for you a lot of things you're going to

343
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,919
notice from the nutrients are flavor

344
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,838
Aroma and color that's gonna be the

345
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,879
first three things I notice flavor Aroma

346
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,200
and color you can see during the grow if

347
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,759
you're getting good colors you can see

348
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,620
if you're getting big fat buds or little

349
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,600
puny buds you can see that then what

350
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,459
about flavor and Aroma smell those

351
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,680
plants smell those butts do they smell

352
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,179
good one thing I used another company

353
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,439
I'm going to try to avoid bashing

354
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,539
companies here but I used to use a

355
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,120
company when I was brand new uh they

356
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,559
sell you about 30 bottles they mix it up

357
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,440
like a science lab all their bottles

358
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,000
have real fancy packaging the labels are

359
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,339
really cool every label is well thought

360
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,159
out really good advertising you see them

361
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,079
in every magazine I got big fat buds

362
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,539
trust me everything was big and fat and

363
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,699
huge and dense and smoked well but it

364
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,039
all tasted exactly the same I was

365
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,660
growing 12 different strains they all

366
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,860
tasted like strawberry bubble gum

367
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,019
because of the nutrients that I was

368
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,759
using and I'm pretty sure that it was

369
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,200
that one bottle a couple of the bottles

370
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,240
made it all taste like bubble gum but

371
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,440
there's one they're Bloom booster really

372
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,778
made everything taste like this

373
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,700
strawberry bubble gum flavor and why am

374
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:07,078
I going to grow 12 different strains if

375
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,579
it's all going to taste like strawberry

376
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,259
bubble gum I should have just grown a

377
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,120
whole bunch of one thing and mono

378
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,500
cropped it I didn't get any variation so

379
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,940
does it taste the way that you want

380
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
that's something that I noticed so

381
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,700
you're gonna see colors you're going to

382
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,839
see flavor you're gonna get flavors

383
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,360
you're going to get Aromas you're gonna

384
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,459
see Bud size and some nutrients will

385
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,019
grow more Leaf some nutrients will grow

386
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,458
more Bud Mass some nutrients I've

387
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,860
noticed make the plants a little more

388
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,379
robust I'm not going to name any Brands

389
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,659
but some Brands will just give you a lot

390
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,458
of fat at buds but a lot of fat leaves

391
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,338
some Brands will give you big robust

392
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,719
stocks and hardly any buds I just I've

393
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,160
learned this from just growing and

394
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,839
experience with nutrients over time it's

395
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,740
all about what works best for you with

396
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:49,019
your results also these results will be

397
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,180
very grower specific room specific

398
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,639
strain specific environment specific

399
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:57,239
everything else will fall into effect

400
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,740
into play here in this uh this that's a

401
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,600
chess board it's a whole chess board

402
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,879
yeah it's 64 squares you got to get all

403
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,620
64 squares right but every one of those

404
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,720
will make a difference in your results

405
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,759
not just the nutrients let me stay

406
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,980
focused here because I am quite dead and

407
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm trying to read these notes so we've

408
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,278
got availability can you get these

409
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,959
nutrients you have to have them shipped

410
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,179
to you maybe think about are you getting

411
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,799
powdered or liquid nutrients if you're

412
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,838
getting them shipped do you want to ship

413
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,500
water because liquid nutrients are

414
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,120
probably 70 to 99 water if you choose to

415
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,559
buy powdered nutrients all you're paying

416
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,759
for at that rate is the powdered

417
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,559
nutrients they're not shipping water

418
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,480
across the country they're more cost

419
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,979
effective you do need to use a scale to

420
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,539
weigh those which I don't mind doing

421
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,100
anyway I'm using a scale half the day

422
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,179
anyway use a scale weigh those powder

423
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,399
nutrients and mix them into the water

424
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,379
stir them up super easy so are they

425
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,179
assist are they available are they cost

426
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,639
effective are they sustainable are they

427
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,559
compatible with your grow style your

428
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,379
plants and each other and then most

429
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,359
importantly do you get results that make

430
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,639
you happy that is the very most

431
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,980
important part is the results now let's

432
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,079
go a little bit deeper into this uh do

433
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,300
you want to work with Organics do you

434
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,399
want to work with salts how organic do

435
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,958
you want to go how scientific do you

436
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,179
want to go that is up to you there are

437
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,799
plenty of brands that do offer organic

438
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,379
products and plenty of brands that offer

439
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,240
completely non-organic products it's up

440
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,820
to you how hippie dippy you want to go

441
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,200
how organic you want to go one thing I

442
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,180
always remind people when they say I

443
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,278
have to grow organically this has to be

444
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:26,338
completely organic I remind them that

445
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,500
cyanide is organic and a little bit of

446
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,139
cyanide will [ __ ] kill you so are you

447
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,720
that hung up on the word organic a lot

448
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,459
of times it is a buzzword uh it makes

449
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,620
things more expensive and it's

450
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,299
unnecessary a lot of the times in my

451
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,399
opinion if you want to be organic if you

452
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,078
think that organic is the way to go I am

453
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,419
not here to argue that I am here to help

454
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,039
you select what is best for you I'm

455
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,019
trying to stay unbiased I'm trying to

456
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,939
give you information and educate without

457
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,679
pitching any brands or any products

458
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,540
because that's that bugs me when shows

459
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,799
do that like I recommend you buy this

460
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,698
and then they do a commercial for it

461
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,838
right at the end of the show and you're

462
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,458
like well that's why you recommended it

463
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,440
because they paid you money like that

464
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,000
sucks all right anyway uh do you want to

465
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
go Organics do you want to go salt do

466
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,940
you want to be hippie dippy if you're

467
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,560
running Organics and you add synthetic

468
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,260
[ __ ] into your mix you are no longer

469
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,299
organic you can't say organic at all you

470
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,799
have not yet non-organic is what that is

471
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,838
any of the words that you made up to be

472
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,338
a combo of those is not accurate organic

473
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,220
means organic once you put [ __ ] that's

474
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,120
not organic in it you are now

475
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,800
non-organic that's all that is so quit

476
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,360
making up new words for that I disagree

477
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,519
you can call it whatever you want but

478
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,139
it's not organic anymore all right how

479
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,278
about cost effective can you afford it

480
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,440
we've already talked a little bit about

481
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,419
that liquid or dry we don't want to ship

482
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,300
water across the country maybe some of

483
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:38,039
you do maybe you want a lot of bottles

484
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,139
maybe you want a few bottles there are

485
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,000
some companies out there that will sell

486
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,220
you 30 bottles there's one company that

487
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,278
sells you three bottles I've seen great

488
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,160
results from both Brands it's kind of

489
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:53,159
all about what you are into how much do

490
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,719
you want to mix how much uh how much OCD

491
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,519
do you have want to have over this how

492
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,620
much control do you really want over the

493
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,120
feet of your plants the three bottles

494
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,220
generally work as like you got a base

495
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,600
and you got something a microbe and then

496
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,160
you got a bloom booster and they just

497
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,839
tell you feed this much of each one

498
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,219
start with your base and then you start

499
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,320
you add microbes and then cut out the

500
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,180
microbes add Bloom booster that will

501
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,620
work your plants will be great there are

502
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,019
other companies that want you to feed

503
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,879
these two bottles on week one this

504
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,500
bottle and this bottle on week two these

505
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,958
four bottles on week three these seven

506
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,820
bottles on week four these five bottles

507
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,338
on week five these nine bottles plus

508
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,019
these two powders on week six there's

509
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,820
companies that want you all kinds of

510
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,159
[ __ ] it is up to you what you want to

511
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,199
choose find a company like said that you

512
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,939
trust you enjoy their ethics a lot of

513
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,439
the time before I ever grew weed I was

514
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,940
reading magazines I was looking at the

515
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,899
internet I don't even think there was

516
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,699
the internet when I was dreaming about

517
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,139
growing about growing dreaming about

518
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,838
growing weed I was looking at magazines

519
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,339
and I would see Brands and they would be

520
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,899
advertising and some of those Brands

521
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,899
would speak to me and some of them would

522
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,059
not you're probably already drawn to a

523
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,980
brand there's already probably a logo a

524
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,119
company somebody said something you

525
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,100
heard something that has got your

526
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,600
attention now just think about that

527
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,980
brand think about the ethics of that

528
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,199
company where do they spend their money

529
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,699
how many bottles do you want you've

530
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,019
already got an idea so do you want to go

531
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,058
a bunch of bottles do you want to go

532
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:11,039
just a few bottles this may really help

533
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,379
with your decision how much OCD and

534
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,519
control do you really need all right

535
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,620
let's move forward from that because I

536
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,039
rambled on with that one

537
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,259
um sources and science where are these

538
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,938
companies learning to make the nutrients

539
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,318
who are the formulators and where are

540
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,360
they getting their ingredients are they

541
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,339
using high quality ingredients or are

542
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,019
they using bottom shelf leftover

543
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,879
ingredients find out where these

544
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,980
companies are sourcing the ingredients

545
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,179
that they are selling you now here is

546
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,860
something I started rambling about

547
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,480
earlier and I cut myself off because I

548
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,879
wanted to get to it sort of here at the

549
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,940
end closer to the end of this rant

550
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,799
it is okay to mix and match nutrients by

551
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,298
that I mean you can use and I'm just

552
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,679
going to say names randomly here don't I

553
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,319
said I was going to avoid names but you

554
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,240
can use a Botanicare base and then you

555
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,939
can use New Millennium additives or you

556
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,880
could use a Advanced Nutrients base and

557
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,298
Botanical additives or you could do that

558
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,740
if you are careful to not overlap any of

559
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:06,900
the elements within those bottles

560
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,819
carefully read what you were feeding we

561
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,100
need nitrogen phosphorus potassium

562
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,480
aluminum sulfur there are a lot of

563
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,000
things I can just go on listing we need

564
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,279
a lot of these things in our plants but

565
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,319
company a Advanced Nutrients did not

566
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,579
talk to Botanica and say hey we're going

567
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,079
to put this in the base so you don't

568
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,279
have to put it in the bloom booster you

569
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,558
don't have to put that in the other one

570
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,538
we don't know that this company didn't

571
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,960
add [ __ ] to that that's already in this

572
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,460
bottle I'm sure that uh company a if you

573
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,380
buy all of their lineup you're not going

574
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,179
to overlap things because they know that

575
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,100
this product has nitrogen this bottle

576
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,840
has phosphorus this bottle has potassium

577
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,519
this bottle has all the other [ __ ] we

578
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,139
need if you go adding a bottle from

579
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,759
another a company they didn't talk to

580
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,500
each other you might be doubling up on

581
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,538
nitrogen you might double up on

582
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,640
phosphorus or potassium or anything else

583
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,220
and then you do risk the chance the

584
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,840
opportunity of burning your plants I'm

585
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,058
going to get off on a side tangent here

586
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,558
a lot of people often ask me about ppms

587
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,200
and how much to feed the plants at what

588
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,019
PPM level I can't give you a PPM number

589
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,480
because I don't know how many ppms of

590
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,579
each nutrient you are using in that mix

591
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,099
and it is very plant specific when you

592
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:13,798
get to the high PPM high performance

593
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,839
plant levels you could feed the plants a

594
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,660
thousand ppms and they'll Thrive you

595
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,819
could also feed them 2500 ppms and they

596
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,400
will Thrive if you give them the correct

597
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:25,678
nutrients if I gave them 2500 ppms of

598
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,380
phosphorus they will cook if I give them

599
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,298
2500 ppms of nitrogen they will cook

600
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,520
it's got to be a balanced diet of the

601
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,779
proper [ __ ] then you can go real high if

602
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,279
you know what you were doing and you

603
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,200
have not overlapped anything too

604
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,418
critically all right I did get off on a

605
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,519
side 10 ship there what I was headed for

606
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,200
is I would recommend instead of mixing

607
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,460
and matching things while you were new

608
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,440
while you were learning your nutrients

609
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,298
while you were determining what works

610
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,620
for you is I would pick a line I would

611
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,839
just pick whatever line you've been

612
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,579
studying just choose one that is going

613
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,678
to work for you it's available it's cost

614
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,259
effective it's sustainable uh you've

615
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,460
it's been getting your attention and uh

616
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:00,480
we don't know the results yet your

617
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,038
friends have had good results that's

618
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,038
probably a good way to measure that so

619
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:07,919
pick that line then I would get the base

620
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,779
the microbe the bloom booster the Cal

621
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,340
Mag if you need it and then see what

622
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,899
else they offer because they all offer a

623
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:14,579
couple of other different bottles I

624
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,038
would get as much of that line as you

625
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,079
feel necessary or as fits your budget

626
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,419
then I would water I would feed that

627
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,279
entire crop that entire run with that

628
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,900
line of nutrients the only way to do a

629
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,178
solid test is to go from beginning to

630
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,740
end with that product if you go adding

631
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,900
in other [ __ ] we don't know what worked

632
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,460
because that is adding anomalies and

633
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,620
then [ __ ] can it's hard to determine

634
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,019
what did what so feed it with that one

635
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,819
line see what you like did it taste good

636
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,220
did it give you enough weight did it

637
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,558
smoke well was it potent if not either

638
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,079
research the next line you need or find

639
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,779
something to add to what is missing from

640
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,819
the line that you have chosen I do use a

641
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,918
specific line but then to that I also

642
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:54,178
add another Brand's Cal Mag and I had a

643
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,940
couple of Bloom boosters from another

644
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,400
company and then I had another trichome

645
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,440
and resin producer from a totally

646
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,179
different company so I'm mixing probably

647
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,700
four or five maybe five or six different

648
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,679
companies feeds in over the course of

649
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,259
flowering but that is because I have

650
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,419
started with one base and I learned them

651
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,740
and I grew with that one base a lot and

652
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,360
I said well if I give it too much of

653
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,640
this product early I get too much Leaf

654
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,139
if I cut this out it reduces my leaf I

655
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,000
get bigger fatter Buds and then I

656
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,740
realized these buds could probably be a

657
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,298
little fatter so I added a bloom booster

658
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,038
and then I realized oh I missed that one

659
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,359
product that I was using before that

660
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,220
would go well in here so I added that

661
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,899
and it worked really well I've just done

662
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,600
it by starting by running the original

663
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,400
base several times documenting my

664
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,918
results seeing what I desired and then

665
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,900
adding one more product every run and

666
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,580
documenting that and comparing it to

667
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,740
previous runs is it better than I get

668
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,079
get more weight more potency more flavor

669
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,058
is it better or did it was it cost

670
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,798
effective did I buy another bottle feed

671
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,960
it and not get [ __ ] out of it or did I

672
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,460
see results a lot of the times I'll see

673
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,740
results a lot of the times I'll just

674
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,600
stop using a product all together don't

675
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,700
be afraid to switch up your nutrient a

676
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,740
little bit per plant these nutrients

677
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,200
will be plant specific like I said

678
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,140
earlier this will be plant specific room

679
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,940
grower phenotype specific this will be

680
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,220
very specific feeding to get dialed in

681
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,900
perfectly for each plant don't be afraid

682
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,700
to adjust if you've got two totally

683
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,500
different plants in the room don't be

684
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,419
afraid to adjust the feed a little bit

685
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,099
for each plant because the plants do

686
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,720
want different things you've got to

687
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,178
develop that relationship with the plant

688
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,500
so you've got to learn the plant and the

689
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,840
nutrients and if you keep switching

690
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,940
things up it is hard to dial that in so

691
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,859
feed that one plant that same nutrients

692
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,419
for at least two or three runs and see

693
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,579
how they react together then start

694
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,520
making Minor Adjustments each run after

695
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,798
that maybe run six plants of the same

696
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,599
strain and feed three one thing feed

697
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,279
three the other and feed three the other

698
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,779
just Minor Adjustments maybe a little

699
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,279
more base nutrients maybe a little more

700
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,899
Bloom booster you know what you're

701
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,119
looking for that is a great way to

702
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,919
experiment but I do recommend locking in

703
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,839
with one brand to start getting as many

704
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,820
of their products as you can either

705
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,139
afford or find necessary I like to buy

706
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:59,579
the whole damn lineup if I'm going to do

707
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,679
it why leave anything out just get them

708
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,658
all get it going feed them see what

709
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,519
happens do it again and then make

710
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,900
adjustments on that third run if I want

711
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,700
to add something take something out

712
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,140
that's when I will make the adjustments

713
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,720
all right the last two notes that I have

714
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,100
on my sheet are run side by sides if you

715
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,480
think that one nutrient is doing really

716
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,279
good and you think another one is doing

717
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,500
really good what's to stop you from

718
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,178
growing if you got a six plant count do

719
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,798
three plant to one and three plants of

720
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,840
another side by side in the same room

721
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,940
and keep it scientific that way you can

722
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,220
figure out which lineup really does work

723
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,440
best for you the last note that I've got

724
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,940
is some things that work for me may not

725
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,798
work for you some things that work for

726
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,058
you may not work for me our Grow rooms

727
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,460
are different our plants are different

728
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,259
our goals our Styles our approaches are

729
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,819
all very different even if they're very

730
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:43,679
similar they are still very very

731
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,058
different so what works for me may not

732
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,440
work for you what works for your best

733
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,058
friend may not work for your worst

734
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,279
friend will work for your girlfriend may

735
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,960
not work for you so be open be flexible

736
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:55,139
and pay attention to the plants because

737
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,519
overall the plants are the boss all
