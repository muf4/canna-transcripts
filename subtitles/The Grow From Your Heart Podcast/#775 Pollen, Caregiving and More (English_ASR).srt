um let's put um our real names on the

79
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,500
package or at least a friendly name a

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,060
usable name on the package I enjoy and I

81
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,219
appreciate and I respect the work you're

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,080
doing to create your own company you've

83
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,359
made a cool Instagram name that is

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,159
whatever uh something crazy hash company

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,260
that is your new name or something seed

86
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,179
company or something Farms that's really

87
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,280
cool I'm proud of you but you don't have

88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,659
to put it on every shipping label when

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,300
you're sending and receiving something

90
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:35,158
the less information on that label that

91
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,140
is unnecessary is the better put your

92
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,459
name and your address on there what I'm

93
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,500
talking about is I get orders that'll

94
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,700
say like the order will be and I'm just

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,739
making [ __ ] up right here don't feel

96
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,979
targeted unless you did this it'll say

97
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,158
like to Bill Smith from ganja Farms

98
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,719
Incorporated in Plano Texas or Seattle

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,280
Washington it doesn't matter where it is

100
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,859
but when you put ganja Farms

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,299
incorporated or big fat weed farm or

102
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,879
whatever on the [ __ ] shipping label

103
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,379
that makes it a little suspicious and it

104
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,840
makes it gives me a couple of suspicions

105
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,399
first of all uh the mail off the post

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,319
office the mail carrier they're going to

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,200
be like who's [ __ ] ganja Supreme

108
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,518
ganja Farm 420 weed smoke who is this

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,738
they're going to want to know what the

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
[ __ ] is in there or maybe somebody in

111
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,040
your area knows that you're ordering

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,060
seeds and they see that name or they've

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,439
recognized that name come through

114
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,699
they're going to pop it open they're

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,259
going to start stealing your [ __ ]

116
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,319
because it's a very noticeable name

117
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,879
blend in be Bill Smith be Jane Doe when

118
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,918
it comes to the [ __ ] male be more

119
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,259
careful please that's my advice my

120
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,418
recommendation my suggestion I see a lot

121
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,919
of people type in random weird names

122
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,198
when they're ordering through I redirect

123
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,399
and I try my best to delete those I

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,960
don't pay a lot of attention to

125
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,659
correcting addresses but if I see that

126
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,180
you've got like weed grow Farms or weed

127
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,800
Warrior 420 or some [ __ ] in your name I

128
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,079
do try to remove that because we don't

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,939
need our packages opened up inspected

130
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,918
and taken sending seeds is not illegal

131
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,719
but don't encourage anybody to mess with

132
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,879
you steal from you or cause you problems

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,800
use your brain use your head then your

134
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,600
company will go further I'm proud of you

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,040
for having the company name but you

136
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,960
don't have to put it on everything I

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,340
don't put I read genetics on anything I

138
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,620
don't put grow from your heart podcast

139
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,599
on anything that's not what it says the

140
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,340

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
content I like this because I know that

211

213
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,758
question I know if one listener has this

214
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,019
question there are probably several

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120

224
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,038
maybe you've discussed this before and

225
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,659
if so my apologies you know what I will

226
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,459
repeat heat subjects on here because

227
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,560
I've realized that not everybody listens

228
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,659
to every single episode people don't go

229
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,519
back and listen to everything if you do

230
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,680
thank you that's a dedicated certain

231
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,120
kind of podcast listener I appreciate

232
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,620
you but most people jump in and they

233
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,019
just catch the future episodes they

234
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,519
don't go backwards so I have talked

235
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,359
about this possibly but we'll do it

236
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,359
again

237
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,220
it says I grow in a three by three scrog

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,620
and I recently had a cannabis variety

239
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,840
that is female including a female test

240
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,879
from a very reputable reputable and

241
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,038
well-known breeder in the community then

242
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,240
it says in parentheses it was not you so

243
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,759
this is not one of my lines we're

244
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,599
talking about here it says this is a 9

245
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:43,379
to 11 week variety at week five uh day

246
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,300
38 In Bloom I found two male flower

247
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,278
clusters so you're growing what you

248
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,958
thought and assumed and probably was

249
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,879
tested to be a female it sounds like it

250
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,819
was a feminized seed you thought it was

251
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,580
a girl and at day 38 guess what we see

252
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,160
some male flowers this female plant is

253
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,320
now showing intersex traits which is a

254
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,919
problem especially around week five of a

255
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,100
9 to 11 week plan it does go on it says

256
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:11,219
I found two male clusters below the

257
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,440
scrog screen very much in the shade so

258
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,180
those are the buds down below the scrog

259
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,380
so there's a screen the lights hitting

260
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,179
down here some of the light doesn't get

261
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,820
down here that part down there is where

262
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,278
we we are discovering the intersex parts

263
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,320
of this plant it says unfortunately I

264
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,659
miss these little bastards and two male

265
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,760
flowers have opened before I found and

266
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,439
removed them alright so you've got

267
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,879
opened up flowers They're popped open

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,160
you can see they've been expressed as

269
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,019
the word we used uh that's never a good

270
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,059
sign that means that they probably let

271
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,100
out some pollen into the air that pollen

272
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,559
is super light does not take a lot of

273
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,778
air for that pollen to move around it

274
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,119
says question since these male flowers

275
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:51,539
were below the scrog below the canopy

276
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,299
just how bad could this be how badly

277
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,919
seated do you think my buds will be uh

278
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:57,899
it says what are the odds that the

279
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,519
pollen will be fertile there's been no

280
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,679
male flower anywhere else on this plant

281
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,480
other than these in the shade by the way

282
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,739
thanks and best wishes all right let's

283
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,120
talk about that for a little bit the

284
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,100
first question

285
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,220
um since these flowers were below the

286
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,959
scrog uh just how bad could it be I said

287
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,700
a moment ago that pollen travels very

288
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,559
easily travel pollen is really light

289
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,778
unfortunately sometimes it goes up I've

290
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,338
seen pollen move up it doesn't always

291
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,439
fall if there's a little bit of airflow

292
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,880
the wind directed off something or

293
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,100
Ricochet something like that I've seen

294
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,019
pollen actually move up into the air so

295
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,778
it could have gone up into your full

296
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,159
canopy I don't want to make you paranoid

297
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,320
I don't want to give you any false hope

298
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,639
it could have gone up there also it

299
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,220
might not have I don't know how much

300
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,958
pollen those few male flowers opened up

301
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,360
but they did let some pollen out

302
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,679
possibly and it probably went up some of

303
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,419
it went down it went everywhere that's

304
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,679
the way that pollen works when they pop

305
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,659
open they kind of have a little pressure

306
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,599
to them it's like they just breathe out

307
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:53,338
just a little bit to let it go so it

308
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,500
could be bad it could be not bad at all

309
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,060
I really we can't tell until a couple of

310
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,679
probably a few days you'll be able to

311
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,819
tell you'll see little kernels happening

312
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,019
and that's where the seeds are starting

313
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,240
to form it looks like something just

314
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,799
went weird like your your calyxes are

315
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,200
swollen up uh what are the odds this

316
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,379
pollen could be sterile or fertile

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,480
that's uh yes both it could be either

318
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,338
way dude it could definitely be either

319
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,659
way and it says there have been no male

320
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,399
flowers anywhere else that's a good

321
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,319
thing cut those off keep an eye on it

322
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,120
pay very close to attention there may be

323
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,980
more you've got six more weeks to go

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,419
possibly I'd probably take this [ __ ]

325
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,700
down early and then not grow it ever

326
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,500
again is what I would do but uh pay

327
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,060
attention you may have produced a few

328
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
seeds you may have produced a lot of

329
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,958
seeds and that's where I go on that one

330
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,278
rant where I say uh grow those seeds bro

331
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,078
you may have just made a bunch of great

332
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,059
seeds for yourself to play with grow

333
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,739
them see what you've created you may

334
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,659
like I've said in a past episode you may

335
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,579
have just created gold you may have the

336
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,980
new chem dog the new Golden Goat the new

337
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,139
uh Gorilla Glue you may have the new uh

338
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,940
chefso G in there who knows what you

339
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,100
just made also you could have made a

340
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,320
bunch of intersex plants that stress out

341
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,360
and hermaphrodite and show problems as

342
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,519
soon as they get a light leak too much

343
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,680
temperature problem or too much shade or

344
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,019
whatever so grow those seeds if they do

345
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,059
happen but I honestly uh without looking

346
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,899
at the plants the room getting in there

347
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,578
with the light and kind of looking

348
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,799
around I can't tell you enough details

349
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,599
to give you any uh diagnosis or

350
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,740
prognosis you could have seeds you may

351
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,560
not

352
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,019
um they could have been fully fertile or

353
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,639
fully sterile flowers that opened up

354
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,620
that pollen could have been good or bad

355
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,439
did you see any dust

356
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,419
if you see any dust laying around those

357
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,620
male flowers like the leaves around it

358
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,819
may just have like it just looks like

359
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,740
you sprinkled them with powdered sugar

360
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,778
that's pollen that's going to be a bad

361
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,820
sign if there's no dust then chances are

362
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,320
a little bit better for you

363
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,000
um that's really all I think I've got

364
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,860
for you for this one keep an eye on it

365
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,360
and then if you do see seeds forming

366
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,100
you've got decisions to make do you want

367
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,320
to finish it or do you want to chop it

368
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,240
down and then definitely consider if you

369
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,220
ever want to run that particular

370
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,259
cultivar again because it did freak out

371
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,000
just from a little bit of Shade that's

372
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,559
not something that I would tolerate all

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,419
right let's keep moving Chef thank you

374
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,919
for the great message let's keep moving

375
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,360
there is another message that came from

376
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,979
our friend Matt

377
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,079
it says hey Ross to Jeff I hope you're

378
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,879
doing well I love the recent Grateful

379
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,338
Dog episode hey thank you for listening

380
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,019
I got a lot of great response to that

381
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,180
episode the number one question that

382
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,560
stemmed from that is can I get seeds or

383
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,899
buy a clone and the number one answer

384
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,659
for that is no not right now maybe in

385
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,159
the future but no I'm not selling clones

386
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,439
or seeds of that one right now I'm

387
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,000
crossing things with it but uh there

388
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,800
will be a Jack the Ripper Grateful Dog

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,240
cross available very soon it's called

390
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,338
Dog Ripper but we're not selling the

391
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,039
Grateful Dog right now it says also I

392
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,500
have got a question for you when would

393
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,019
you consider a home grower ready to

394
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,940
advance to the role of caregiver and do

395
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,459
you have any advice regarding scaling up

396
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,959
a grow over time so this is a great

397
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,638
question let me talk about what the word

398
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,979
caregiver means

399
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,159
most of what I'm going to say applies to

400
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,379
the Colorado medical cannabis market and

401
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,939
most of this is info from around 2008

402
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,799
2009.

403
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,560
since that time we have changed the term

404
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,479
from caregiver to provider but let me

405
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,359
explain this when we started medical

406
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,339
cannabis a lot of people wanted access

407
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,139
to medical cannabis without going to a

408
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,360
dispensary when you got your medical

409
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,240
cannabis recommendation from a doctor it

410
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,919
gave you the right to grow six or more

411
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,700
plants depending on the paperwork you

412
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,620
got

413
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,079
so people were allowed to grow six

414
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,700
plants now the catch was some of these

415
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,319
people were very sick they were

416
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,139
receiving medical cannabis for a reason

417
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,639
which also limited their ability to

418
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,320
produce their own cannabis maybe they

419
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
were sick maybe they were physically

420
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
unable maybe they just didn't have the

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
room the space and of course the

422
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,459
knowledge to produce their own cannabis

423
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,320
so what those people would do is they

424
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,599
would assign somebody that would be

425
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,000
called a caregiver to produce their

426
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,620
medical cannabis products for them so

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,240
when I go to the weed doctor the weed

428
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,698
doctor gives me a paper and it says you

429
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,680
can smoke and grow and have weed then on

430
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,240
that card there's a spot that says who

431
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,578
is your caregiver

432
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,139
I would find a friend or we would find

433
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,879
somebody a lot of people would find me

434
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,100
and they would list so we'll just put me

435
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,480
as the caregiver and Mike uh I've got

436
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,639
your permission to do this I hope I'm

437
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,560
gonna use Mike as an example when the

438
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,820
medical cannabis thing came up our good

439
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,039
friend White Mike he's a medical

440
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,320
cannabis patient he likes the way I grow

441
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,179
weed so he asked me one day want to be

442
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
my caregiver and I said I would be

443
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,620
honored to bro so then at that point he

444
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,360
wrote my name on his card and sent it

445
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,278
into the state and that gives me the

446
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,740
right to grow Mike's medical marijuana

447
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,139
plants for him so I could have those in

448
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,759
my possession in my cultivation area and

449
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,159
it would be fully legal because I was

450
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,259
Mike's caregiver now when that weed was

451
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,719
ready it was my responsibility to

452
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,240
provide Mike with that product

453
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,240
there were not many legal stipulations

454
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,519
or bylines or guidelines or bylaws or

455
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,320
anything about how I could give Mike his

456
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,060
medicine I wasn't supposed to make a

457
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,980
profit from it is what I think that the

458
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,599
uh the paperwork said but I could

459
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,240
definitely charge Mike for electricity

460
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,680
my time my seeds whatever I felt

461
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,899
necessary but I wasn't supposed to

462
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,638
profit off of Mike for it which I never

463
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,100
did Mike always got the hookups on the

464
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,620
weed but my responsibility and my role

465
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,079
as a caregiver was to grow safe

466
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,179
effective cannabis for Mike and Supply

467
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,099
it on the Rhythm that Mike expected is

468
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,419
medicine and he needed his medicine and

469
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,040
he would tell me what he liked the best

470
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:12,599
and I would grow that and I would have

471
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,698
it when he needed it at a price he could

472
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,920
for afford most of the time I just gave

473
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:18,539
it to him because that was just the the

474
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,578
bond that we had he liked the way that I

475
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,838
grew he gave me the ability to grow more

476
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,179
plants because I had his medical

477
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
marijuana card it kept me legal and safe

478
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,539
so I just grow enough and make sure to

479
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,458
set some aside for Mike and anytime he

480
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,439
needed it there it was and it worked out

481
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,698
that way one of the best parts about

482
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,279
that is

483
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,659
being Mike's best friend uh we're bros

484
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,980
we're in the car all the time we're next

485
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,559
to each other in the office we're at the

486
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,320
dab table together I know Mike's

487
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,419
physical ailments I know Mike's uh

488
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,399
mental state I know what Mike likes I

489
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,559
know what Mike what flavors Mike enjoys

490
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,299
so I got to really dial in Mike and I

491
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,979
together got to dial in what medicine

492
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,019
Mike was receiving and what I was

493
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,519
providing for Mike I know that he loves

494
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,799
Grateful Dog if he could have Grateful

495
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,720
Dogs seven days a week 24 hours a day

496
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,039
that's what Mike would smoke and I could

497
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,480
see it on him like I'd be like it's

498
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,740
about time for Mike to get some weed so

499
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,838
I could see his body and his facial

500
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,939
expression change time to smoke Mike out

501
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:11,159
so we got to develop like a real bona

502
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,199
fide caregiver uh patient relationship

503
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,140
which I think was great so that is the

504
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,880
caregiver idea we would be assigned as

505
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,799
his caregiver and then I could grow

506
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,959
cannabis for him and when he needed that

507
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,179
cannabis it would be ready for him and

508
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,339
if he needed Edibles topicals oils

509
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,259
whatever it would be my responsibility

510
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,659
as his caregiver and friend to make that

511
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,119
product available and ready for him for

512
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,460
his consumption needs to fix his

513
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,918
ailments to improve the quality of his

514
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,900
wife was the bottom line so that's what

515
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,419
a caregiver is the idea is to provide

516
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,860
cannabis for a medical marijuana patient

517
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,660
since then they have changed the term to

518
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,579
provider you just write provider in the

519
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,860
card and they've also really limited us

520
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,379
now in Colorado back in the day you were

521
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,519
allowed to have uh like unlimited counts

522
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
to where you could just get everybody

523
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,400
could be you could be everybody's

524
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,500
caregiver

525
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,559
so like everybody in the neighborhood I

526
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,880
would be Clint Mike my mom uh [ __ ]

527
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,379
the neighbor the neighbor down the

528
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,460
street I was all of their caregiver and

529
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,740
I was just growing so much Urban

530
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,779
providing herb for everybody so I got a

531
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,460
lot of experiences how I understood uh

532
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,319
what people like what people want how

533
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,660
often they do it I learned a lot by

534
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,579
doing that sort of stuff that got me

535
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,160
um that definitely worked well in the

536
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,720
medical cannabis Realm

537
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,279
so we would do what was called card

538
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
stacking is I would have everybody's

539
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,460
cards and I would just grow for all of

540
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,740
them and we'd put all their plants in

541
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,058
one cultivation area then the state came

542
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,179
down and said you can only have six

543
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,399
patients which limited me to uh that

544
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,160
would be six times six is 36 plus my six

545
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,140
that was 42 plants then counties started

546
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,820
saying oh you're only limited to 12

547
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,919
plants you can have your six

548
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,119
recreational and your six medical plants

549
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,460
but you're not allowed to grow more than

550
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,079
that which the states and counties or

551
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,240
the cities and counties are allowed to

552
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,460
do that sort of stuff within their own

553
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,558
boundaries and borders their own uh

554
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,819
what's it called their own Council so uh

555
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,319
that's what happened a lot here so now

556
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,720
we're just limited to 12. now I can grow

557
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
12 plants I basically keep it down to uh

558
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,579
10 females and two boys is what we

559
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,200
basically do you got the the 12 count so

560
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:09,418
um that was the role of the caregiver

561
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,360
that's what a caregiver does and is

562
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:15,179
expected to do now our friend Matt here

563
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,918
is asking when is the uh when do you

564
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,720
know it's time to consider a home grower

565
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,100
ready to advance to the role of

566
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,900
caregiver that's a really good question

567
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,279
question it's a really thin line that

568
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,200
you're skating there between caregiver

569
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,480
and home grower so let's talk about that

570
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,580
the way that it worked for me is people

571
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,319
enjoyed smoking the herb that I grew

572
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,240
people saw me out they're like you are

573
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,038
and this sounds egotistical but at the

574
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,380
time I don't know about now but at the

575
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,298
time around here I was one of the best

576
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,980
and most noticed weed growers that there

577
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,019
was I was working with dispensaries I

578
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,819
was growing weed everywhere I came up

579
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,319
real quick and people noticed it so a

580
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,480
lot of people wanted me to be their

581
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,159
caregiver also I was involved in a

582
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,960
dispensary so that put me out there a

583
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,820
lot and I got to be a lot of people's

584
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,160
caregiver so people knew that I was

585
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,379
growing good weed they knew that I knew

586
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,058
how to interact with people and have uh

587
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,100
conversations and build relationships

588
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,440
and that I'm compassionate and uh what's

589
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,579
the other word I've got empathy and um

590
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,080
yeah I just like to connect with people

591
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,359
and I care about you and I love the way

592
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,220
that uh when you smoke you feel better

593
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,558
and so that just made me I had the

594
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,240
caregiver mindset so

595
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,918
um people sought me out so what I would

596
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,058
say how you know when you're ready are

597
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,220
people

598
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:22,259
um are there people in need of medical

599
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,360
cannabis knocking down your door for the

600
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,919
weed are there people have you made a

601
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,418
relationship with one or two people who

602
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,580
just really love what you do because

603
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,500
that's all it takes like like I said my

604
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,298
buddy Mike so we'll say Mike Kevin and

605
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,160
Pops were probably three of my main

606
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,200
patients that I took care of that I was

607
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,179
provided their caregiver uh signed their

608
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,380
caregiver those three dudes will tell

609
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,360
you that I grew the best weed they've

610
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,220
ever smoked ah those three guys that's

611
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,899
why I was their caregiver I was their

612
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,220
friend and I also grew the best herb

613
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,380
they could smoke so if you got somebody

614
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,940
that's saying hey uh Matt do you have

615
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,140
any more of that we do group hey Matt do

616
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,460
you have any more of that we do grew

617
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,080
that one thing you grow is the only

618
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,640
thing that makes me feel better

619
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,740
that's when it's time for you to step up

620
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,840
and become a caregiver but there comes

621
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,359
great responsibility can you provide the

622
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,519
product which that patient requires on

623
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,139
the timeline which they require it do

624
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,359
they smoke an ounce a week do they smoke

625
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,000
two ounces a week can you handle that

626
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,678
demand sustainably maybe for a month or

627
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,720
two you can do it but can you do it for

628
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,400
the next three to five years without

629
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,860
missing a beat to keep that person

630
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,538
medicated perfectly and beautifully can

631
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,038
you grow like a what's it called a

632
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,019
surplus so that when you've got to go on

633
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,759
vacation or clean up the room or if a

634
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:29,339
power outage happens and you [ __ ]

635
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,720
lose a crop can you back up Surplus

636
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:33,359
enough stockpile enough to make sure

637
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,860
that person has got their medicine think

638
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,259
about what you're able to do think about

639
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:40,019
your realistic limitations can you

640
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,359
provide a quality a safe ethical quality

641
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,119
product for this person on the timeline

642
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,558
which they require it if you can build a

643
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,058
relationship with them find out what

644
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,740
they need find out what they like best

645
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,960
and start providing caregiver Services

646
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,240
don't get in over your head if you can

647
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,919
do one or two people that's cool how are

648
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,359
you going to cover the cost of this

649
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,580
product are you going to charge them a

650
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,678
little bit are you going to charge other

651
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,058
people like well a lot of so this is in

652
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,679
the past I used to give the [ __ ]

653
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:06,779
medical patients weed for really really

654
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,759
cheap if not free and I would sell black

655
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,038
market weed to the other people and the

656
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,119
people that didn't have any medical

657
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,798
recommendation or didn't even talk about

658
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,779
medical weed just the Stoners and my

659
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:17,700
Bros and the gangsters they'd pay full

660
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,960
[ __ ] price but the patience they

661
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,819
would get some free [ __ ] and they would

662
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,679
get some hookups so you've got to decide

663
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,538
how you want to run that it is kind of a

664
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,519
business you've got to run this like a

665
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,079
business uh but a little bit different

666
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,298
than a business because most businesses

667
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,980
kind of uh just run about money this is

668
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:33,900
all about compassion and taking care of

669
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,579
people so you got to pay attention to

670
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,798
the people how are you going to cover

671
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,918
your own costs you've got to buy soil

672
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,720
nutrients lights air water you've got to

673
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,640
do work all of that costs something are

674
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,200
they going to pay for that will it be a

675
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
donation basis will they give you so

676
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,980
much a month and you let them have what

677
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,140
they need think about that before you

678
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,700
even get into it talk to them about it

679
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,799
be like hey Ross to Jeff said we should

680
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,440
talk about this starting conversations

681
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,579
is awkward just say Ross Jeff said we

682
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,740
should talk about this before I be your

683
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,359
caregiver or [ __ ] play this episode

684
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,740
and be like hey here's the things we

685
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,298
should talk about are you going to pay

686
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,400
for it how much do you need how much do

687
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,900
you want how do I get compensated like

688
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,940
talk about all those things and figure

689
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,860
it out so that you can still be friends

690
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,360
if something does go wrong that's the

691
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,399
most important part of all that is that

692
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,259
we're all still friends after all the

693
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,820
chips fall so

694
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,980
um that's how I think you know when

695
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:24,480
you're ready when you qual you have a

696
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,099
customer or a client or a friend

697
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,779
requesting your product and you've got

698
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,139
faith in yourself that you can provide

699
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,058
that product consistently now advice on

700
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,380
scaling up

701
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,298
um

702
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,220
yeah one of the most important things is

703
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,720
electricity can your house handle it can

704
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,038
your building facility wherever you're

705
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,079
growing you set a home grower I'm

706
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:47,099
imagining you're in a home can your home

707
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,379
handle that also are you ready to have

708
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,178
um so cannabis is a commodity it's a

709
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,059
valuable commodity it's a profitable

710
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,340
product you're entering the area the

711
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,200
arena of having a profitable product on

712
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,699
hand in your home and it sounds like

713
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,679
you're about to upscale the amount of

714
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,019
that product you have and is being

715
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,120
produced which will make you double

716
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,460
triple quadruple the size of a Target

717
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,019
which you already are people may not

718
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,140
know you're growing law enforcement

719
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,339
thieves Crooks uh crackheads none of

720
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,020
them may know that you're growing but

721
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,579
when you start scaling up things will

722
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,079
become more obvious and more apparent

723
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,579
there will be more people coming and

724
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,319
going from your home there'll be more

725
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,418
electricity there'll be more sound

726
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,460
you'll be buying more products if you

727
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,960
make some money be careful that when you

728
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,400
make money you don't come up too fast

729
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,319
and show people that you got a brand new

730
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,460
car and a bunch of chains if you're in a

731
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,599
place where you shouldn't be making a

732
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,798
little bit of money that's when things

733
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,779
do happen to you

734
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,079
I think one of my first pieces of advice

735
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,538
would be to don't scale up maximize what

736
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,099
you have got dial it in get the room the

737
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:46,919
space the environment that you have got

738
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:49,379
to its full potential if you're pulling

739
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,179
uh one pound now try to get two pounds

740
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,520
out of it if you're getting two aim for

741
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:56,460
four maximize that before you even

742
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,740
consider moving up to a bigger grow and

743
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,840
adding more equipment more toys more

744
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,880
money more responsibility more

745
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,619
opportunity for failure you're going to

746
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,600
have people relying on you so if this

747
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,399
crop does fail it's going to be more

748
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,558
detrimental than if your personal smoke

749
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,880
failed you can go to The Dispensary you

750
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,500
can hit up one of the homies and get

751
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,140
some black market herb if you need to

752
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,759
but this person they're relying on you

753
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,799
so you have got to produce that product

754
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,240
I said Black Market is that politically

755
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,400
correct anymore is that the gray Market

756
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,900
the free market you know what I mean

757
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,059
that's where I'm talking about you may

758
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,100
have to go get your product if your crop

759
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,500
fails our patients do not have that

760
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,759
opportunity they're relying on us they

761
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,740
know that we are growing that product

762
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,298
safely we know that it's the strain they

763
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,339
want they know that it's the potency

764
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,079
they want at the frequency that they

765
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,058
need it so they're going to rely on you

766
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,740
don't scale up too big and [ __ ] things

767
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:45,899
up because that does happen quite a bit

768
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,819
when you are scaling up make sure that

769
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,320
you your electricity can handle it make

770
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:51,418
sure that you can handle it is it too

771
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,740
much work think about Harvest time do

772
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,620
you have a trim crew that can manage

773
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,778
that Harvest will that be possible I

774
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,058
would say scale up to one light next

775
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:02,700
don't go like from one light to four

776
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,798
lights go from one to two and then maybe

777
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,019
from two to four

778
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,298
I think for a one-man operation in a

779
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:12,119
good sized room nine lights and I'm

780
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:14,339
talking about old 1000 watt [ __ ] HPS

781
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,959
lights because I'm a dinosaur nine

782
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,298
lights is probably the limit that I

783
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,620
would do if you got like nine R specs in

784
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:21,418
a room that's gonna be a killer [ __ ]

785
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,979
room that's probably the amount of work

786
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,380
that I would expect I would expect one

787
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,700
person to do in a cultivation in a home

788
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,039
after that it's going to get a little

789
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,980
bit crazy and a little bit hectic so

790
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,200
scale up slowly dial everything in

791
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,599
before you add more learn everything get

792
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,278
it perfect before you add more

793
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,658
um learn how to scrog everything learn

794
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,400
how to Trellis everything beautifully

795
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,919
learn how to pop and twist learn how to

796
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,960
defoliate dial in your feed dial in the

797
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,659
light dial in the air dial in the water

798
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,720
get everything perfect before you expand

799
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,400
then expand slowly one light then if

800
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,679
you've got two then go to four if you

801
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,019
got four then go to nine that's just the

802
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,759
way that I would do it slowly scale up

803
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,519
make sure that your light your house can

804
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,500
handle it and then also I'm in Colorado

805
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,298
if I set up a grow in the summer it's

806
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
going to kick ass but right now in the

807
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:09,538
winter it's going to change everything

808
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,759
will be different before you scale up

809
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:13,079
run a small grow in that room and get

810
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,819
that room figured out get that

811
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,859
environment figured out for a solid year

812
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,480
before you scale up too big because you

813
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,158
might buy build a room that in the

814
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,079
winter it works perfectly but when the

815
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,340
summer comes it gets so hot that you

816
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,019
can't run it because you can't add

817
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,459
electricity you can't add air

818
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,798
conditioner because you cannot add

819
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,140
electricity that will be a problem so

820
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,639
build up slowly let it run for a year

821
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,038
build up again let it run for a year

822
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,840
build up again that is probably my

823
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,419
advice for that he wraps it up with

824
