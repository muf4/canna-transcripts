52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,399

seeds the 4K or FMS also uh this

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
listener is asking if those free seeds

64
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,519
are testers no those seeds have been

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,159
thoroughly tested those seeds are part

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,800
of the iy genetics premium seed lineup

67
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,318
they've been thoroughly tested they pass

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,200
testing their quality seeds I could sell

69
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,439
them if I chose to sometimes you'll

70
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,000
notice right now the 4K is a freebie the

71
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,280
4K is also available in a six-pack if

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,280
you wanted to purchase that um sometimes

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
I choose the freebies based on my

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,959
inventory based on demand um I actually

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,439
happen to have a whole bunch of those 4K

76
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,360
seeds so those ended up being the

77
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,598
freebie for a little while here I've got

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
a very limited number of the Cherry goat

79
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,479
and instead of trying to break those

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,039
into packs and sell those as packs I

81
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,719
just made them the freebie so if you

82
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,759
spend 100 bucks you do get the Cherry

83
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,400
goat freebie but the question is are

84
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,120
those tester seeds or have they been

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,000
tested those seeds are thoroughly tested

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,799
if I'm giving out a tester seed it does

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799
Clearly say tester seed on the website

88
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,840
on the packaging we make that very very

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
very clear um I like to give out the

90
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,878
testers with a little pamphlet they come

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
with a little card that has sort of a an

92
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,719
informational little piece on there and

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
kind of what I would expect from those

94
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,158
tester seeds it's got a link to the

95
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,399
website it's got a link to the Discord

96
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:40,359
it tells you what I hope you would do

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,280
with those testers gives you the testing

98
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
criteria and welcomes you to the testing

99
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,719
team so if you get testers they are

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,158
clearly marked as testers now um and

101
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,799
many people have been asking how they

102
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,318
become testers for IE genetics I've made

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
it very easy at the first of every month

104
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,000
usually around the first of every month

105
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,158
we will be late uh in June because I

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,239
will be away at the dude grows cup but

107
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,840
most of the time around the first of

108
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,200
every month I do add new testers to the

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,158
website those testers are at a reduced

110
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,359
price they go up on the website there's

111
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,000
usually between 30 and 60 packs of

112
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,159
testers available it just depends on how

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,919
I decide to do it how much testing I've

114
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,839
done how much testing I want you guys to

115
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,279
do but generally at the first of every

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,039
month I do add packs of tester seeds to

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,000
iir and those are available for purchase

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I've done a full uh talk about why I

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
make people purchase those but I feel

120
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,680
like I get more uh more feed back more

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,879
results people uh they do more work if I

122
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,800
charge them for those tester seeds so

123
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,719
the testers will be available around the

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840
first of every month I do put up new

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,520
testers uh in the month of June I'm

126
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,638
going to do something very unique with

127
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,560
my testers I'm going to put up two

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,120
different testers um I used the same

129
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,360
pollen donor on these testers but I used

130
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,360
two different phenotypes of the pollen

131
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,520
receiver and I'm not sure which one I

132
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,360
like better so I'm going to offer both

133
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,478
packs as a tester it's number one and

134
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,479
number three they will both be available

135
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,918
as testers for the month of June I'm

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,918
going to try to figure out a way to give

137
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,038
you a discount if you buy both that way

138
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,758
you can run both packs at the same time

139
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,279
and then we can see if phenotype number

140
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,199
one or phenotype number three is the cut

141
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,679
that we should put to Market so I'm

142
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,879
going to do it that way in the month of

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,639
June there will be two testers available

144
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,680
uh it's basically phenotype number one

145
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,280
and phenotype number three you guys get

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,319
to test those right along with us my

147
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,758
crew is testing them too and then we can

148
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,000
decide which works best in your Gardens

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
and those will be what are released put

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,279
out to Market so thank you for helping

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,639

152

176
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,000
photos in the lemon Jeffrey tab on the

177
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,918
Discord server let me get off on a

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,120
tangent here and talk about Discord this

179
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:33,598
was not prepped this was not in the

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,759
notes anywhere this is just a random

181
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,680
thought and idea uh a few people have

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,400
messaged me saying that Discord is not

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,038
very easy to use that they cannot figure

184
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,839
out the Discord yes my Discord server is

185
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,360
overwhelming Discord itself is a little

186
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,839
bit overwhelming if you are new once you

187
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,080
figure it out once you poke around a

188
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,959
little while it is very simple to use

189
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,680
when you click on the IR Army Discord

190
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,959
you'll be in the IR Army Discord there's

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
a row of tabs on the left um I'm not

192
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,598
looking at the Discord so I don't

193

should shouldn't be too hard to navigate

288
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
if you just realize all those tabs on

289
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
the left are just the different

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,120
categories that are available click on

291
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,759
that tab it opens up that category you

292
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
can read that if you want to contribute

293

attachments I'm sure you guys know how

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,679
to work the internet at that point my

301
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
point is that Discord server isn't as

302
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,759
overwhelming as it looks there are just

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,480
a lot of tabs and it looks like a lot to

304
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,200
look at once you start clicking around

305
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,079
and navigate and get comfortable it's

306
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,079
all the same thing over and over again

307
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,039
just in different categories all right

308
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,078

328
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,200
you are doing well um I'm great bro I'm

329
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,759
here on the podcast I'm high as giraffe

330
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,360
[ __ ] and I'm hanging out with you guys

331
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,120
I have nothing to complain about it says

332
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,800
being a perpet ual grower is there any

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,679
benefit to completely resetting after a

334
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,838
run by this I mean let your current

335
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,039
plants finish without starting anymore

336
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,880
is there anything to gain by doing this

337
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,039
that you cannot gain without doing a

338
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,799
full reset this is a very very good

339
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,599
question so our friend is running a

340
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,399
Perpetual grow which means they've

341
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
always got plants coming in and always

342
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,159
got plants going out of that grow

343
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,480
they've established a routine and a

344
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,480
rotation and a schedule I don't know

345
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,440
their routine rotation or schedule so

346
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm going to hypothetically make it up

347
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
let's just say that every 2 weeks they

348
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,959
are harvesting a plant and to replace

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
that harvested plant they are moving a

350
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,759
new plant right into that room so every

351
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,078
two weeks they've got a harvest they cut

352
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,360
down one plant move another plant in cut

353
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,719
down one plant move another plant in so

354
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,278
by doing that you're always going to

355
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
have plants in different stages of

356
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,759
flower you'll have plants in beginning

357
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,000
of flower a couple of weeks in four

358
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,480
weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks into flower you'll

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,639
have a plant that's just about ready to

360
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,680
harvest now the main idea of a Perpetual

361
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,000
grow is to create a rhythm and harvest

362
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,958
on a schedule perpetually now I don't

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
know this person's schedule routine or

364
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,319
Rhythm but I'm going to hypothetically

365
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,399
say that every 2 weeks this person is

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
able to harvest a plant and as soon as

367
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,519
that plant is chopped down they drag in

368
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,440
another plant just to fill that space

369
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,278
and then every two weeks repeat that

370
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,800
process now if they get this going

371
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,759
successfully that means that they've

372
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:56,078
always got a plant in week one week

373
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,439
three week five week seven and week nine

374
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,559
and then they can Harvest till week nine

375
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,279
a lot of times they're going to go week

376
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,638
10 or week just to keep the Rhythm on

377
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,480
track but if they get this successfully

378
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,159
on Rhythm they're always going to have

379
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
plants at different stages of the grow

380
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,360
now that is a Perpetual grow one in one

381
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
out or a certain amount in a certain

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,360
amount out every week on a rhythm I

383
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,239
don't know how many this could be one

384
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,000
plant at a time this could be a thousand

385
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,278
plants at a time as long as the Rhythm

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,240
works you are perpetually harvesting

387
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,919
plants uh a lot of people like to fill

388
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,919
the room run it all at once and chop

389
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,319
everything down all at one time uh

390
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,838
that's a lot of work you get a lot of

391
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,760
reward all at once but it's a pain in

392
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,880
the ass has to harvest dry trim cure

393
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,720
that much weed all at one time so for

394
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,720
some people the Perpetual is the way to

395
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,320
go you can supply exactly how much

396
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,040
medicine you need that way you're not

397
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,680
overloaded with the big trim job you're

398
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,319
always just trimming a little bit

399
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,278
instead of a whole bunch at one time and

400
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,360
then some gets too dry some gets messed

401
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,039
up uh if you're just perpetually doing

402
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,199
it you can set your own Rhythm and have

403
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,679
the medicine as you need it so the main

404
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,879
question here is am I missing any

405
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,758
opportunities by staying perpetual and

406
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,278
not shutting down for a certain amount

407
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,759
of time after a full harvest the only

408
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,039
things I can really think of and I made

409
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,120
a couple of notes Here uh would be a

410
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:12,240
huge clean and reset and uh with the

411
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,399
foresight to send this question I would

412
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,919
imagine that you are doing a good clean

413
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,198
and reset in that room but what I like

414
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,120
to do when I harvest an entire room is I

415
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,799
clean that entire room from the ceiling

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,360
to the floor 100% I will clean the floor

417
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,319
I'll take the light bulbs out put new

418
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,360
bulbs in there we clean the lights we

419
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,680
clean all the fil filters the fans

420
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,120
everything gets super clean the reason I

421
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,599
like to do that when the room is empty

422
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,600
is because then I can get step stools

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,199
and ladders in there and I can get up on

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
top of things and clean without worrying

425
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,078
about destroying breaking damaging any

426
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,639
of the plants uh dropping something on

427
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,278
the canopy breaking a branch uh also

428
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,120
getting all the dust from the lights and

429
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,679
the fans and the blowers I don't want to

430
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,078
wipe that off of the fan or off of the

431
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,679
blower and have it land into my canopy

432
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,719
so that's a big part of why I like to do

433
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,919
the full breakdown reset and start over

434
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,879
but honestly that is the only major

435
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,679
advantage to finishing everything all at

436
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,399
once maybe uh maybe once every once a

437
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,799
year once every six months maybe

438
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,480
consider stopping the Perpetual cycle

439
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
and just having a bunch of stuff in veg

440
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
ready to go do that full clean and then

441
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,079
start over because sometimes I like to

442
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,759
spray fizan or uh maybe H2O2 or

443
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,799
something like that in the room uh just

444
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,600
to clean it up and sanitize everything

445
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,958
really well just to prevent problems

446
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,759
because uh sometimes problems just arise

447
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,000
and if you're doing preventative things

448
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,318
every so often you won't have problems

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,440
uh as likely let me get back to my notes

450
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,039
what about some of those corners and the

451
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,360
spaces that you can't get to when the

452
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,078
room is full there's always that one

453
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
corner in the grow space it's in there's

454
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,679
something floating like a little piece

455
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,159
of debris I'm not tripping you guys

456
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,318
there is some [ __ ] flying through my

457
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,240
there's two of them flying through the

458
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,838
recording space here maybe the drugs are

459
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,720
kicking in let's just try to do this

460
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,360
podcast uh there's always that one

461
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
corner that's always got a little bit of

462
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,639
muck in it I'll admit I've got that one

463
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,600
corner in M grow it's hard to get to

464
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,318
it's always got a little funk in there

465
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,278
um can you clean that one with without

466
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,120
taking out all of the plants can you

467
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,720
clean all the odd spaces can you get to

468
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,759
the corners can you get to the the

469
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,519
ducting the fans the tops of the lights

470
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,680
can you clean all of that if you can do

471
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,440
that without taking out every plant go

472
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,198
for it then there's no reason um but if

473
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
you've had a big issue if you've had any

474
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,519
bugs any powdery mildew anything like

475
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,519
that then I would definitely stop the

476
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,000
routine clean everything take everything

477
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,480
out I'm sure you guys saw that moth

478
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,519
flyby just now uh we are in what we call

479
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,920
Miller season here in Colorado a lot of

480
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,720
people might not know about this and

481
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,000
Colorado uh we just hit the start of uh

482
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,680
we're in the middle of May the start of

483
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,519
May here uh right at the beginning of

484
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,120
may we get these moths these Miller

485
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,360
moths they just come out of nowhere

486
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,078
they're attracted to the light I don't

487
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
know where they come from but they

488
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,879
they'll fill up your garage your house

489
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,879
and then when you open a cabinet or

490
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,159
something if they're in there in the

491
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,759
garage you open up the cabinet they come

492
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,078
flying out I'm rambling because it is

493
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,800
the season they're flying toward my

494
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,198
light right now it's not going to stop

495
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,559
for a couple of weeks and they are gross

496
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:57,039
it's Miller time you guys all right

497
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,359
where was I I'm trying to read this

498
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,879
message um if you had bugs or something

499
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,440
then I would definitely recommend uh

500
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,640
especially powdery mildew or spider

501
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,400
mites or anything worse then I would do

502
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,240
a full reset but if you haven't found a

503
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,280
problem if you haven't seen a downside

504
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,318
to your Perpetual keep it going just

505
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,000
make sure you're getting in there and

506
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,720
cleaning all those nooks and crannies

507
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,160
cleaning the floor um is there something

508
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,558
that you haven't like like uh do you

509
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,000
have something over the floor to keep

510
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,558
the floor dry to keep water off the

511
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
floor lift that up see if something's

512
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,759
getting under there see if you have any

513
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,640
moisture uh calcium buildup mold see if

514
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,440
anything is crept underneath there just

515
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,200
go check the corners check the details

516
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
the nooks and crannies and see if you're

517
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,600
missing anything otherwise uh keep that

518
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Perpetual growing and keep killing it I

519
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,319
hope you guys just saw the bug that time

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,240
so I have evidence and I'm not really

521
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,558

526
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,038
seeds from iy direct.com all right I'm

527
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,200
just going to put a piece of paper over

528
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,240
my drink here so that that moth doesn't

529
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,360
get in it or put moth dust in there cuz

530
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,919
moth dust is freaking disgusting and we

531
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,319
are going to keep on recording I hope

532
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:03,480
you can't see that on the camera cuz

533
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,399
that will be distracting I'm just going

534
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,599
to move that I'm not even going to edit

535
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,400
this part out this is going to be in the

536
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,199
show so enjoy all right we've got one

540
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,918
also came from that growel tab on IR

541
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,639
genetics.com so my friend eclips make

542

00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:28,960

547
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,879

that's what makes these wheels keep

550
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,319
going so thank you it says I actually

551
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,400
have two questions well you're only

552
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,240
going to receive one pack of seeds but I

553
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,038
will answer both of your questions it

554
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,000
says when making seeds is it necessary

555
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,640
to let the plant fully mature or can we

556
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,440
Harvest when the seeds are falling out

557
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,038
of the buds since the potency is not a

558
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,360
factor uh that's a very good question

559
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,400
and um I care about the buds the flowers

560
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,879
the tricomes the green part at all when

561
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm growing for a seed I only focus on

562
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,200
the seeds so um you are growing for seed

563
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,798
at this point focus on the seed when

564
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
that seed is ripe and ready that's when

565
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,519
you harvest uh that is the fruit you're

566
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,480
looking for at this point we've changed

567
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,200
our Focus so yes um it is all about the

568
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,240
seeds who cares what those buds are

569
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,400
doing I'm sure you've heard me talk

570
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,200
about changing my light cycle uh when

571
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,960
I've got seeded plants my buds my plants

572
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,319
look like total [ __ ] by the time they're

573
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,360
done when they're seed

574
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,798
uh they are reving uh they're spitting

575
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,759
out new shoots they look really confused

576
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,599
but the seeds are completely healthy and

577
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,279
that is 100% my focus so I don't care

578
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,599
about the buds and neither should you if

579
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,678
you are focused on growing for seed

580
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,759
production the next part oh and also you

581
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,480
said wait till they fall out of the buds

582
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,480
by the time they're falling out they may

583
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,759
actually start to get too hard at that

584
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,558
point they may have a problem

585
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,119
germinating they'll get a little too

586
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,000
hard the coating on the outside gets a

587
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,798
little too thick I would recommend

588
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,880
harvesting before they start falling out

589
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,158
um generally um you can tell when the

590
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,200
seeds are getting ripe they'll start

591
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,200
getting hard um about 5 6 7 weeks into

592
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,960
the after they've been pollinated I will

593
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,360
just simply grab a couple you can see

594
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,600
them you can see them in the plant grab

595
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,599
a couple cxes pull out the seeds rub

596
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,240
them between my fingers if those seeds

597
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,119
are super hard and put dents in my

598
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,640
fingers when I squeeze them those seeds

599
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,959
are ready if those seeds Crush squish or

600
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,280
pop they're obviously not ready so once

601
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,840
I've got a lot of hard seeds in that

602
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,839
batch they're basically ready and I

603
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,558
don't need to let them go any further I

604
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,759
chop down that entire plant hang it

605
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,079
upside down let it dry and then at that

606
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,000
point it is almost ready for processing

607
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,839
so um the first part is uh no there's no

608
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,079
reason to let the plant finish you are

609
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,399
now focused on growing for seed so only

610
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,000
focus on that seed at that point you

611
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,759
were a seed farmer the second question

612
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,400
is uh what would make a male drop his

613
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,599
pollen Sachs early meaning they have not

614
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,720
opened yet but they are falling off when

615
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,798
I barely moved the plant thank you for

616
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,839
all of your time and and much love um

617
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,759
sometimes the plant those are called

618
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,359
anthers by the way sometimes the plant

619
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,519
will begin to make anthers early in the

620
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,199
flowering phase and those are just kind

621
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,278
of its uh just its first showing its

622
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,038
first anthers it's its first little ball

623
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:15,798
set right there and it's going to make a

624
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,038
lot more so those first few anthers

625
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,200
don't really matter they popped out the

626
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:20,759
plant thought it was time to start

627
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
throwing pollen but it wasn't really

628
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,960
ready so it just kind of it put out

629
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,440
anthers to show hey uh I'm ready to go

630
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,079
but it wasn't really time for that plant

631
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,759
to pollinate yet so it had to keep

632
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,759
developing more anthers and fill those

633
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,400
anthers with pollen so basically what I

634
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,278
think happened is those original male

635
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,960
flowers they just popped out they didn't

636
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,159
have any use he wasn't fully mature

637
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,600
ready to breed yet um he hadn't reached

638
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,520
uh puberty yet is kind of what I think

639
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,918
I'm saying is and he was just show those

640
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,759
those are like his pre pubes he was just

641
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,840
showing like look I got balls dude but

642
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,879
those weren't the balls that were there

643
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,599
for breeding it will produce plenty more

644
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,799
pollen sacks plenty more anthers in the

645
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,558
future which will produce a ton of

646
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,639
pollen sometimes those male plants will

647
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,319
try to autoflow on you if you get them

648
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,480
rootbound or don't give them enough

649
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,000
light and a lot of times those anthers

650
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,839
will not produce pollen they'll just be

651
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,159
the little starter anthers to show you

652
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,119
hey I'm going to go into flower if you

653
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,880
don't do something and I really think

654
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,639
that's kind of what you got here uh a

655
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,240
little bit of just showing you like hey

656
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,038
I'm a boy and I'm ready to get it on

657
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,798
even though those uh those balls didn't

658
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,319
hold any sperm or any pollen if you will

659
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,158

660
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,720
ready to go bro he's giving you a

661
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,960
warning like put me in a room with some

662
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,120
ladies or I'm going to do it myself so I

663
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,200
think that that is why those few anthers

664
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,639
are falling off don't worry um it's

665
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,159
going to make a lot more try to move

666
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,799
that mail plant as little as possible

667
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,799
because every time you touch it bump it

668
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,720
move it breathe around it pollen is

669
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,679
moving let him build up as much pollen

670
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,440
as he possibly can and then try to give

671
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
him one good shake when it's time and

672
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,558
