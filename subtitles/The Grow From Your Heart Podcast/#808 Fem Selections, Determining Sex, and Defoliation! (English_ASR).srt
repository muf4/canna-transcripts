a great time at the end of the event I

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,900
was like hey Bill you want to go get

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280

56
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,860
glazed eyes and he's like bro I'm so

57

100

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,740
the customers they want to come talk to

167
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,719
me I'm kind of the face of the company

168
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,460
they have a lot of questions Mike can

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
keep business moving and keep things

170
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,120
flowing for me and I appreciate that

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,259
while I'm giving people shout outs I

172
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,840
want to send another shout out to my

173
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,300
dude Billy bong smoking like I said that

174
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,459
dude flew in from Hawaii uh he was on

175
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,199

176
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,478
he got to hang out with me and Mike we

177
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,879
hung out from about 11 to about six

178
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,439

179
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,819
hours in hanging out with each other of

180
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,899
course we were working most of the time

181
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,399
it was a a retail event so we started so

182
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,719
many conversations we would ask a

183
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,000
question and get started on a

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,620
conversation then have to stop and help

185
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,478
whoever was coming up to the booth not a

186
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,160
problem but we started so many

187
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,779
conversations and did not finish a lot

188
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,400
of them so Billy we got a lot more

189

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,740

to my buddy wolf uh it's wolf it's

197
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,660
groovy gravy without wolf these events

198
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,639
would not happen wolf put this one on uh

199
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,319
from what I noticed it went on without a

200
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,699
hitch it was Flawless parking at the

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,439
beginning was a little questionable they

202
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,478
got that figured out it flowed like a

203
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,579
dream after that they got us in uh we

204
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,439
got right to the booth we got set up the

205
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,000
customers came they shopped so the way

206
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,038
they did this one you bought tickets for

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,500
a one-hour time slot you were allowed to

208
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,818
shop from noon to one then they uh

209
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
sequestered you is that the word

210
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,759
escorted you out to the back of the

211
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,199
event where there was plenty happening

212
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,060
in the backyard there was a band out

213
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,220
there there was music there was plenty

214
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,899
of food there was tacos uh there were

215
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,000
sandwiches there was ice cream there was

216
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,198
cheesecake there was hash to be smoked

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,519
out there there was a lot going on out

218
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,139
there in the back patio so it wasn't

219
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,659
like you were forced to leave but you

220
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,098
got a one hour shopping spot inside and

221
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,419
then you were kind of escorted out to

222
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,038
the outside part where you could hang

223
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,019
out with everybody and chill make

224
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,219
friends and mingle if you wanted to but

225
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,139
I feel like the event went super

226
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,940
smoothly all of the time blocks came in

227
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,918
all of the time blocks shot they left

228
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,680
like they were supposed to between the

229
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:40,139
shop time slots the vendors get a 15 a

230
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
10 or 15 minute break between each wave

231
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,740
or time slot and that makes it super

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
nice I can rearrange my booth I could

233
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,978
take a quick drink of whatever I'm

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,019
drinking I could go take a piss if I

235
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,279
need to honestly a lot of the time when

236
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,779
it was a 10 minute break I would just

237
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,159
take a big fat dab it was a

238
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,439
non-consumption event you guys so

239
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,580
allegedly I was taking dabs it's

240
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,538
different when you're a vendor they're

241
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,579
not going to kick you out when you paid

242
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:00,598
a bunch of money to be there but it was

243
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,000
a great event and it could not have

244
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,620
happened without our buddy wolf also

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
known as groovy gravy bro if you ever

246
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,780
see this I don't know if you watch the

247
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,000
show I don't know if you ever hear the

248
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,519
shout outs but bro thank you I was an

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,439
honor to be a part of The Groovy gravy

250
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,120
secret stash and I hope I'm invited next

251
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,379
year it is uh to the best of my

252
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,360
knowledge I think it's kind of like an

253
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,759
invite-only sort of an event there are

254
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,400
very minimal amounts of Booth spaces in

255
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,900
the small venue which we choose and I

256
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,098
think it's full it's it's pretty full

257
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,138
and we get basically it's all the

258
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,939
top-notch breeders in there so it's kind

259
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,379
of an invite only I hope I keep my

260
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,879
invite next year and if you guys did not

261
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,099
make it this year if I'm there or not

262
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,139
next year you guys gotta go so plan your

263
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,940
trip you're gonna have to choose or

264
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,500
maybe come out for a long week a long

265
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,659
month and stay for the dude grows cup

266

269
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,160

270
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,799
restaurant Mike is not vegan I'm not

271
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,480
vegan I'm just a vegetarian but it's way

272
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,919
easy to go pick out food for me when I

273
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,720
just go to a vegan restaurant I can eat

274
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,819
everything on the menu Mike actually

275
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,800
found some stuffy thoroughly enjoyed so

276
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,240

competition with any of them we're all

correcting [ __ ] for bro I see you anyway

420
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,620
it says uh what's what are some steps

421
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,479
you take to sexing a new bean I have a

422
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,659
couple of strains that are very shy and

423
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,100
do not want to show me their goodies you

424
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,838
got some plants that are some prudes

425
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,000
over there uh we're trying to make these

426
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,040
plants show you their sex

427
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,480
um the main thing I focus on when I'm

428
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,778
trying to get plants to show me their

429
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,639
sex is an uninterrupted 12-hour dark

430
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:58,799
period that's basically what's going to

431
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,200
put our plants into flower so I would

432
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,299
change the timer from 12 from either 24

433
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,278
hours on which a lot of people do or 18

434
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,019
hours on and six hours off which is what

435
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,299
I recommend so I would go ahead and I

436
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,519
would change that timer to 12 12. I

437
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,259
would put it on a flowering cycle that

438
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
12 hours of Darkness will tell the plant

439
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,220
hey fall is coming it thinks the end of

440
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,560
the world is near and it wants to flower

441
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,139
so it should go into flower if your

442
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,078
plants are in this uh 12 12 situation

443
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,180
for about 10 days 14 days and they do

444
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,399
not begin to show you flour I would say

445
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,679
expect you've got some light leaks or

446
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,139
these plants have got what we call a

447
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,239
very strong critical period the critical

448
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,919
period is the amount of Darkness of the

449
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,480
amount of uninterrupted darkness which

450
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,698
it takes to trigger a plant to go into

451
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,560
flower these plants could be from a

452
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,599
region on the globe where it takes a

453
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,939
little longer to trigger them but most

454
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
plants the reason why we chose 1212 is

455
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,779
because it seems to work with most

456
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,160
plants to put them into flour I do have

457
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:56,159
some notes Here let me get onto the

458
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,500
notes uh give them 12 hours of daylight

459
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,899
and 12 hours of uninterrupted Darkness

460
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,639
for 10 to 14 days they should start

461
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,860
showing you sex if not like I said

462
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,299
before I suspect a light leak they're

463
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,740
not getting that dark period they're

464
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,439
probably stretching more than you want

465
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,959
them to that should be an indicator so

466
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,540
put the plants in 12-12 wait for sex

467
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,619
they should show you by day 17 you

468
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,480
should definitely know what you're

469
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,919
working with then once you've made your

470
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,899
determinations which are males or

471
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,939
females uh coal which ones you don't

472
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,100
want I'm a seed breeder sometimes I I do

473
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,839
a female hunt just for boys once you

474
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,759
found the boys or girls get rid of what

475
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,639
you do and do not want keep the rest

476
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,578
then return them to either 24 hours on

477
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,740
or 18 hours on and six hours off of a

478
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,120
lighting cycle now I do understand that

479
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,339
some people are not going to want to put

480
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,078
their little tiny plant into flower and

481
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,459
then shock it make it show us sex and

482
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,739
then put it back they find that to be

483
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:48,479
too stressful for the plant really it's

484
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,698
not that big of a deal but if you don't

485
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,278
want to do that I do have an option for

486
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,979
you you can veg your plant from seed

487
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,259
until it is large enough to take a clone

488
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,899
when you take that clone you can then

489
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,819
put the Clone directly into 1212

490
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,820
lighting and that clone should go into

491
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,920
flower like I said in 10 to 14 maybe 17

492
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,379
days at the most it'll start showing you

493
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,179
if it is a boy or a girl when you take

494
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,919
those clones be very careful I should

495
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,838
have mentioned this already Mark your

496
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,639
plant label your plant somehow you can

497
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,120
give it a number a letter you can give

498
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,919
it a people name it could be uh a32 Jack

499
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
if you want you can get as creative as

500
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,059
you want but when you label that plant

501
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,060
a32 Jack make sure you label the Clone

502
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:32,099
came from it a32 Jack as well so we know

503
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,599
which is which that way when your clone

504
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,639
shows sex if you're going to toss the

505
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,500
males like most people do you could toss

506
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,899
the male clone and you could toss the

507
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,759
big plant at the same time then you've

508
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,919
just eliminated all the boys the clones

509
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,019
and the potted plants now you've just

510
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,419
got females left in the room another

511
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,919
option kind of on the same boat here you

512
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,360
can take you can veg your plants out

513
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,299
until they're big enough to get a clone

514
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,940
label them we got Jack a32 this time

515
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,399
we're going to use Jill 52b and we're

516
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,899
going to take a clone of Jill 52b now

517
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,600
we're going to put those clones under

518
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,459
lighting under the 24-hour lighting and

519
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,019
we're going to let those root but then

520
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,939
we're going to take our big plants and

521
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,619
put those into the flower room and flip

522
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,120
those because we've been vegging them

523
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,739
for a while anyway they're already big

524
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,178
enough to grow and produce a little bit

525
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,439
and they're just the first time we're

526
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,540
running them I don't want to veg them

527
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,980
too big because they could be intersex

528
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,779
they could be ugly it might not be

529
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,000
something I'm interested in so let's

530
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,678
just grow those in that original of

531
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
they're probably in a one a three gallon

532
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,340
pot they're big enough to get a clone

533
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,200
own let's just flip those as soon as

534
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,058
those plants show you sex you can flip

535
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,620
you could toss the males and also go

536
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:37,379
back and toss the Clones that went with

537
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,558
that now something I should mention if

538
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,020
we go from 12 12 from seed if you sprout

539
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,019
seeds put them immediately Under 12 12

540
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:48,058
uh lighting it may take two or three

541
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,819
weeks for those plants to adjust their

542
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,619
hormones to even really go into flour so

543
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,259
it may take you three to four weeks to

544
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,079
actually see the sex if you go directly

545
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,759
12 12 from seed not every plant every

546
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,740
strain is going to do that but it is

547
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,480
very possible that it could take a

548
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,640
minute for those hormones to develop for

549
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,558
the plant to go I'm growing I know I'm

550
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,419
under 12 12. I'm not sure what to do yet

551
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:10,980
then the certain hormones the correct

552
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,660
hormone will hit that plant and it'll go

553
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,360
I know what I'm supposed to do this is

554
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,980
12 12 lighting I'm gonna flower so they

555
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
may need a little bit of time just to

556
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,640
adjust if you're doing this straight

557
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,379
from seed if the plant has grown big

558
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,940
enough and you've taken a clone from it

559
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,980
it's already developed enough of those

560
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,080
hormones that those clones definitely

561
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,460
will flip right away okay so the main

562
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,619
thing we're talking about here is

563
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,079
something called critical period that is

564
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,699
the amount of time that a plant takes to

565
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,439
decide that it needs to go into flour

566
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,480
the amount of uninterrupted darkness

567
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,298
that that plant requires to trigger the

568
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,339
flowering phase I think 1212 is the

569
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,798
trick for most plants that's why we the

570
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,319
general rule of thumb is 12 12 that

571
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,119
should work if not like I said before my

572
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,980
first suspicion is that these plants are

573
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,959
not getting that uninterrupted Darkness

574
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,980
they may be getting a light leak again I

575
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,538
don't know what's going on you said

576
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,860
they're just being stubborn they're

577
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,538
being shy and not showing you their

578
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,159
goodies it may be a light leak make sure

579
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,379
they're getting that uninterrupted

580
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,058
Darkness also they may just be too young

581
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,799
to show you their goodies you might may

582
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,839
need to wait till they at least reach a

583
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,339
little bit of more hormonal level then

584
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,740
they'll start to show you what they've

585
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,240
got going on my dude Terps I'm pretty

586

Rasta Jeff thank you for all you do

610

everything I know from you the irie Army

612
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,659
and the dude grow show bro thank you for

613
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,580
the great compliments ah thank you for

614
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,679
supporting the irie Army and also big

615
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,599
shout out to the dude grow show the

616
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,640
message goes on it says I love your work

617
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,798
and your brand you are bringing the

618
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,600
knowledge and the fire to the people

619
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,460
thank you for noticing dude also thank

620
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,740
you for noticing then it says my

621
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,038
question is how often would you

622
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,319
defoliate when you are scrogging I do a

623
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,240
two trellis system in play the first one

624
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,740
is to fill the canopy the second is to

625
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,960
support that's a great strategy that's

626
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,038
basically what I do use the first one to

627
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,019
spread them out then you get those

628
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,839
chunky colas use that second one to hold

629
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,759
them up great strategy there it says is

630
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,980
there a particular time and frequency

631
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,200
you defoliate your personal or

632
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,538
commercial grow I basically handle

633
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,880
defoliation the same in a personal and

634
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,798
Commercial grow whether I'm growing for

635
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,220
seeds or flowers or whatever I basically

636
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:02,099
do the same method schedule and strategy

637
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,720
so it goes on I lost my place to be

638
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,579
honest with you it says I've seen other

639
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,000
recommendations of heavy Leaf strips the

640
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:11,579
week before flip at day 21 and at day

641
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,279
42. honestly dude that's a great

642
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,199
strategy that's basically what I do uh

643
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,240
very close to what I do says personally

644
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,819
I clean up the skirt and any potential

645
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,120
Bud sites the week before flip and then

646
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:26,399
nothing till day 21 I lollipop to my

647
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,038
first trellis and then only a light

648
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,980
cleanup again uh for blocked Bud sites

649
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,140
and heavy leaf on Leaf areas for airflow

650
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,200
you're doing it pretty close to how I

651
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,000
would do it but I go I've got notes so

652
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,679
I'll talk about that more let me read

653
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,419
the rest of what you've got it says

654
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,880
periodically I'll take a leap for two

655
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,280
when necessary until week 10 where I

656
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,380
strip her bald headed into Harvest yes I

657
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,639
love a uh a pre-harvest strip that way

658
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
you just get all those leaves off there

659
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,820
turn the lights off come back the next

660
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,919
day chop it down you don't have as much

661
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:58,500
junk to clean up yes I do appreciate

662
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,440
that he uh starts he finishes up with I

663
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,179
love going 18-6 the week 10 of flower

664
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,460
bro thank you for saying that because so

665
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,140
many people are skeptical and so many

666
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,240
people have sent me basically hate mail

667
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,759
and told me that I'm ridiculous and wild

668
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,279
and crazy and uh basically [ __ ] for

669
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,079
recommending to go 18 hours on and six

670
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,119
hours off at the end of flower I've

671
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,220
noticed the people that have tried it

672
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,538
[ __ ] love it everybody that tries it

673
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,759
sends me a message and they say hey bro

674
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,679
I tried this [ __ ] awesome the people

675
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,240
who haven't tried it tell me I'm [ __ ]

676
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,220
crazy there's something that I notice

677
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,659
about that anyway thank you for trying

678
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,700
it thank you for having faith in me and

679
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,100
thank you for saying that it is working

680
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,840
uh then it does go on it says the next

681
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,178
cycle in an attempt to really try to

682
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,418
maximize potential I'm doing a main line

683
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,500
into a scrog any recommendations uh no I

684
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,120
don't really [ __ ] with the main line

685
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,220
just fill that scrog don't worry too

686
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,259
much about the main line scrog just like

687
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,480
you are I think you will be happier

688
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,460
the main line

689
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,960
um no offense the main line to me is for

690
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,279
people who are only allowed to have one

691
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
plant they just don't have [ __ ] to do

692
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,119
all day so they're doing as much as they

693
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,558
possibly can to that one single plant

694
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,538
that's how I feel about mainlining it's

695
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,798
just a lot of work to one plant when

696
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,839
what you've done with one plant

697
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,460
mainlining I could have done that with

698
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,019
the whole garden just scrogging it

699
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,519
trellising it popping twisting and

700
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,500
cropping it properly

701
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,058
if you got one plant go for it if you

702
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,980
got all day but I don't have all day to

703
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:18,480
[ __ ] with one plant that's just me I'm a

704
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,759
commercial grower I think on a much

705
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,140
larger scale it says any recommendations

706
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,119
yeah that was my recommendation we'll

707
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,580
talk more about the the defoliation also

708
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,199
then he wraps it up with take a fat dab

709
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,658
and give your mom a hug for me hey bro

710
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,798
that's my line what do I say now what am

711
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,600
I going to say at the end of the show

712
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,339
you stole my line man no I'm just joking

713
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,019
I'm confident here we go

714
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,119
um so the main question here is about

715
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,220
defoliation and your strategy you said

716
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,439
that you uh do it a week before flip

717
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,200
which is basically I would do it the day

718
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,640
of flip mainly because

719
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,380
um just strategy for the rooms it's

720
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,320
easier for me to defoliate in the bigger

721
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,120
room I do start defoliating a little bit

722
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,220
in veg but not heavily just some of the

723
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,678
giant leaves those will come off and veg

724
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,720
then day one a flip I'll give it a nice

725
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,360
defoliation then basically like you said

726
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,038
you said day 21 and 42

727
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,158
um yeah that's basically what I would do

728
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,619
uh two weeks in about four weeks in but

729
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,960
about two weeks in is when I do the

730
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:17,219
shave and the Lolly popping and a heavy

731
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,259
deleting so flip it uh do a d-leaf not a

732
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,240
major but a pretty good one let it ride

733
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,700
then two weeks in I'll do a major

734
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,259
lollipopping I'll shave the legs I'll do

735
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,759
some defoliation I'll do a bunch of

736
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:28,859
popping and twisting and a lot of

737
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,538
working into the canopy if anything is

738
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,639
getting too tall so week two is really

739
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:34,980
when I go kind of hard I'll do it again

740
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
at week four and then I do continue all

741
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,220
the way up into week six if I see [ __ ]

742
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,079
down there underneath the canopy that

743
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,519
just doesn't look good I'll just take it

744
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,960
off I don't want to waste that I don't

745
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,940
want to trim it I'm definitely not going

746
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,319
to trim that [ __ ] later I just want to

747
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,058
pull that off and let it actually put

748
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,980
that energy that feed those nutrients

749
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:51,000
that love somewhere else in the plant up

750
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,679
top where it's going to be worth

751
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,779
trimming is basically what I'm thinking

752
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,400
so one of the things I really wanted to

753
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,220
mention was

754
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,019
um I don't like to do one super hard

755
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,759
defoliation keep in mind I kind of come

756
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,099
from a commercial cultivation background

757
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,440
so I've got a room uh let's just say a

758
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,119
hundred foot by 100 foot room with a I'm

759
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,200
gonna say five or eight hundred plants

760
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,558
in there I'm just guessing and making

761
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,900
[ __ ] up I I wouldn't go in and super

762
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,058
hard defoliate one section what I would

763
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,220
do is I would set a timer and I would

764
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,480
try to spend I would divide the day in

765
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,860
quarters and make sure that I did a

766
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,240
quarter of the day on this part of the

767
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,038
room and a quarter over here and a

768
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,778
quarter here and a quarter here so that

769
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:29,579
I don't have one section that's heavily

770
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:31,740
defoliated and the rest looks like the

771
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:34,079
70s Bush I would rather go around the

772
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,058
room multiple times and take off light

773
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,220
layers every time around the room and

774
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:40,619
just continuously do that other than

775
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,179
just go take if you got multiple tables

776
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,519
that's how we do it we just say don't go

777
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,559
strip that table naked strip all the

778
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,720
tables a level two then come back and

779
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,399
strip all the tables to level four don't

780
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,440
just do one section at level [ __ ]

781
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,659
eight right away go lightly all the way

782
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,038
around the room that just creates uh a

783
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,380
better airflow it creates less micro

784
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,058
climates more even and it's better for

785
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,860
your mind I think also you just see the

786
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,480
progress differently instead of getting

787
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,918
all these naked and then going I got all

788
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,179
that left to do you go oh we kind of got

789
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,559
part of the whole room and you get to

790
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,659
move around the room instead of being in

791
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,940
one place I like to put on a podcast put

792
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,860
on some music and just defoliate I could

793
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,500
defoliate all day it's very Zen for me

794
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,599
pulling the big pedials seeing how many

795
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,038
big ass trash bags or five gallon

796
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,418
buckets of leaves I pulled just feels

797
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,519
real good to me I don't know it feels

798
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,900
like I'm accomplishing something so

799
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,119
honestly it feels like you've got the

800
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,500
right idea there's no uh no right or

801
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,939
wrong way to do this if you're pulling

802
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,380
too many leaves that is the only wrong

803
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,360
way and you'll be able to tell because

804
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,299
the plants will slow down uh you're

805
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:40,678
doing it a week before day 21 and day 42

806
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:42,298
I go day one day 21 and day 42 basically

807
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,220
um give them that good leg shaving give

808
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,798
them the lollipopping I think you're

809
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,960
doing everything just about perfectly do

810
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,579
you do any popping and twisting

811
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,720
um some super cropping that may be the

812
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,798
only thing that you may need to

813
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,860
implement in your scrog game my dude pot

814
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,778
casso or potty oh toker I love the two

815
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,278
names dude that's three names I got here

816
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:04,619
for you thank you for the great message

817
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:06,659
I will take a fat dab I will give my mom

818
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:08,579
a hug for me in the meantime here's a

819
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,559
reminder please do send me your shipping

820
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:13,019
address with a real name and also a

821
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,819
reminder what episode so you did win the

822
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,379
free seeds on so I could scroll back see

823
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,178
that I do actually owe you prizes guys

824
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,919
don't try to scam me I am paying

825
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,298
attention we're better at this than you

826
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,100
think all right we're gonna keep moving

827
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,679
I do have another great message here in

828
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:28,259
front of me this one came from our

829
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,600
friend who wants to be called Daft

830
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:32,400
Punk's luggage that sounds like a heavy

831
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,619
uh task right there you got helmets and

832
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,778
dance gear in there anyway let's stay

833
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,000
focused here on the podcast Daft punks

834
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,740
luggage my dude I owe you a free pack of

835
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,359
seeds so like I've said before please

836
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,038
send me your real name with the shipping

837
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,678
address and also remind me what episode

838
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,960
number I read your message on and I will

839
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,298
send you a free pack of irie genetic

840
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,179
seeds the question from our friend Daft

841
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:56,460
Punk's luggage goes a lot like this it

842
00:27:54,179 --> 00:28:00,179
says roster Jeff I do know the

843
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,220
difference between f1s f2s f3s Etc so

844
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,019
those are just filial Generations it

845
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,880
says each being a new filial generation

846
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,558
selected from a mating pair from the

847
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,539
previous generation all right so it

848
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:11,220
sounds like you do understand it says

849
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,619
theoretically each generation is getting

850
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,019
closer to stabilization if good

851
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:18,058
selections are made by the breeder yes

852
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,519
that does all make sense that is

853
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:22,500
accurate it goes on it says what do you

854
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,679
see when you self with silver

855
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,019
thiosulfate using a strong female from

856
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,600
each generation that is a very very good

857
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,400
question it goes on there is more it

858
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,558
says you have mentioned in previous

859
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,440
episodes that you have seen greater

860
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,720
variation in f2s more of the grandma and

861
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,298
grandpa than and some weirdos than you

862
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,480
do in the f1s does this prove true

863
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:46,798
through selfing f2s as well I may have

864
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,120
stumbled through reading that but that

865
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,339
is a very good question let me try to

866
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,739
explain what this person is asking when

867
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,319
you are breeding regular seeds with male

868
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,720
and female seeds the second filial

869
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,418
generation often shows what we call

870
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,400
transgressive segregation well we will

871
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,940
see as we will see progeny that

872
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,940
outperform both parents we will also see

873
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,100
uh representations of the grandma on

874
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,340
both sides and the grandpa on both sides

875
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,139
and possibly weird recessive traits F2

876
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:18,658
is kind of like the Pandora's Box we

877
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,940
kind of open up a lot of weird stuff F3

878
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,500
is kind of weird also F4 you start

879
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,899
mellowing [ __ ] out by the time you're at

880
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,200
F5 you're getting a lot more stable so I

881
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:29,519
do talk about the F2 showing a lot more

882
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,899
phenotypical variation some of us are

883
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,460
into that I'm a breeder I want to see

884
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:34,259
that weird [ __ ] that I can find in there

885
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,000
some of you guys don't like it but

886
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,819
that's what happens we get that weird

887
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,819
wildness that comes from the f2s now

888
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,980
they are asking if I were to take an F2

889
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:46,439
one of those f2s that came from that

890
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,440
batch of seeds and reverse that one and

891
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,419
self it am I going to find as wild uh

892
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,259
different phenotypical variants in that

893
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,520
F2 if I make in that S1 from that F2 I

894
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,778
know that's a bunch of a bunch of

895
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,579
different numbers there but it does make

896
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:01,558
sense if you're following along the

897
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:02,759
simple answer to that is no I'm not

898
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:04,440
going to find as many different

899
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,658
phenotypical variations and very

900
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,000
variances because I have not really

901
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:11,159
introduced anything to unlock Pandora's

902
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,778
Box I'm just taking one plant and I'm

903
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,580
just taking its chromosomes I'm taking

904
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,558
the pollen from that putting it back on

905
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,960
there it's just going to replicate that

906
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,639
plant if I were to take

907
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,798
um a plant from that a female from that

908
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,740
F2 and take another female from that

909
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,259
same filial generation and not self it

910
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,720
but reverse it and put the pollen on a

911
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:33,058
different phenotype at that point I may

912
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,798
see more phenotypical variants than I

913
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:36,658
would normally do with the selfing or a

914
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,158
reverse project but I think that would

915
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,679
be the only way to open up that

916
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,419
weirdness again is if I put it on a

917
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,038
different plant or if I pollinated one

918
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,200
of those reversals with something from

919
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:47,640
another generation but so I think the

920
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,340
short answer of what I'm trying to say

921
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,880
is no we will not see the wild

922
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,980
phenotypical variation if we were to S1

923
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,778
and F2 and if you're following along

924
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,659
with breeding class that does make

925
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,880
perfect sense there is more to this

926
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,960
question it says the reason I ask I like

927
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,860
that you've got a reason for the

928
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,259
question

929
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,479
it says I just bought a pack of yours

930
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:12,240
and sub cools Jack the Ripper F2 number

931
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,759
four and I'm interested in exploring the

932
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,558
genetics I wonder if I should open

933
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,960
pollinate the group to improve my

934
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,298
chances of getting a winner or should I

935
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,819
call the males and then self the best

936
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:26,220
looking female to see what she has in

937
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,019
her that is a great question that's all

938
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,179
about how much time how much space how

939
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,058
much energy uh what you really want to

940
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,100
do with this I've done in my opinion

941
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,079
I've done a pretty good selection on

942
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:39,359
this breeding project I know that the

943
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,519
Jack the Ripper F2 number fours are

944
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,079
really good seeds so you will find a

945
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,058
good winner in there there will be a

946
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,619
female in that batch that meets the

947
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,379
criteria you're looking for will have

948
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,418
all the Jack the Ripper traits the limey

949
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,760
dryer sheet flavor the head ripping Buzz

950
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,960
the strong growth I will have all of

951
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,058
that for you

952
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,038
if you want to open pollinate that to

953
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:00,538
take it to the F3 you will make

954
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,879
something amazing that would be a really

955
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:05,158
fun step to take these seeds but that

956
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,419
will take more time space and energy if

957
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,340
you just want to select the female

958
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,538
you've still got to grow out all the

959
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,158
seeds you've still got to find the

960
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,259
winner female you got to call the Boys

961
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,880
At this point you probably could have

962
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:16,798
just done the open pollination project

963
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,460
right here so

964
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:22,259
why not do both why not uh veg them get

965
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,720
clones of everybody do the open

966
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:26,339
pollination in that process you'll see

967
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,600
the female in there that stands out to

968
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:29,579
you you will notice even though it's

969
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,259
pollinated you'll see it it'll be

970
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,058
visually appealing it'll smell great

971
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,158
you'll know what the keeper out of that

972
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:37,798
project is I know you will have faith in

973
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,679
you so veg them take clones of everybody

974
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,359
do the open pollination select your

975
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,919
favorite female out of that you've got a

976
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,019
clone of her and backup in the clone

977
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,778
machine or in the Clone Dome keep that

978
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,639
one Harvest everybody else go back take

979
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,380
make two clones of your favorite keeper

980
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,620
and then do the selfing project again

981
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,720
that's in a in a [ __ ] Ideal World in

982
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:59,278
a fantasy land right there I'm not sure

983
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,558
which would be best for you both would

984
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,000
be amazing uh you've got two totally

985
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,099
different projects in there you could do

986
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,319
the open pollination with the entire

987
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,480
packs you've got probably five males and

988
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,980
five females just tossing all those Jack

989
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,380
the Ripper genetics around you'll make

990
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,000
some amazing [ __ ] uh or you've got the

991
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,200
option to do selective breeding you

992
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,880
could pick your favorite male and

993
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,340
favorite female will breed those

994
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,039
together and make a selectively bred F3

995
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,898
the open pollination will also be F3 I

996
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,759
would just call it open pollination F3

997
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:28,439
that's what I would call that uh the

998
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,538
selective breeding would be better for

999
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,700
the the F3 but your other option there

1000
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:35,038
is to find your favorite female and self

1001
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,259
it all three of those sound like very

1002
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,519
fun projects for their own reason I

1003
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,259
don't want to decide for you which one

1004
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,538
you should do you're kind of asking

1005
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,980
which one should I do but uh should I

1006
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,859
call the males and then yeah I would do

1007
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,538
them all this is like a a five-year

1008
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:50,459
project but I would do all this [ __ ] if

1009
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,319
I were you it does go on it says I do

1010
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,419
have a plant count limit and I would

1011
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,000
love to grow 100 plants do a proper Fino

1012
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:58,740
hunt but I have kids and that is that

1013
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm going to stay within the bounds of

1014
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,058
the law bro that is respectable and

1015
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,679
respectful I did not write this down but

1016
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:06,778
let me jump in and talk about something

1017
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,280
here that you just said uh you want to

1018
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,079
do a final hunt and you've got a small

1019
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,060
plant count and you don't have time or

1020
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,719
the ability to sift through a large

1021
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:17,338
population of seeds uh me too bro I am

1022
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,039
in an area where my plant account is

1023
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:22,619
limited to 12 plants also I've got a

1024
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,418
podcast a seed company and a five foot

1025
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:26,460
long dreadlocks everybody in my city

1026
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,079
knows who I am I'm pretty sure law

1027
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,480
enforcement knows who I am by this point

1028
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,098
I've got to be very careful I do not go

1029
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,780
over my plant count because they would

1030
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,240
love to make an example of me at this

1031
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,700
point so I am only able to do 10 or 12

1032
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,559
plant final hunts at a time just like

1033
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,439
you the way that I work through a

1034
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,418
hundred seeds is I will start 10 seeds I

1035
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,918
will grow them if something doesn't look

1036
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,658
right in the beginning I immediately

1037
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,279
toss that [ __ ] get rid of it I don't

1038
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,838
want it then I'll grow them out

1039
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
sometimes those mutants are winners but

1040
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,960
if I'm breeding and doing certain [ __ ] I

1041
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,820
know what I'm looking for so I'll grow

1042
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,159
them I'll get rid of the boys if I'm not

1043
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,838
looking for boys so at this point I took

1044
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,759
10 seeds I probably narrowed them down

1045
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,858
to five before we get like into the

1046
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,640
flowering phase then I'll flour those

1047
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:07,920
out

1048
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,659
as soon as they go into flower if I

1049
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,119
popped if I got five in the flower room

1050
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,920
I germinate five more immediately now

1051
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm back at my plant count why am I

1052
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,519
wasting numbers I'm just gonna pop more

1053
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,380
seeds to replace those uh so out of

1054
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,659
those five I'll probably keep one or two

1055
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,700
now I've got five more coming up I'm

1056
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:26,039
gonna repeat the process keep one or two

1057
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:27,719
I'm also gonna pop more seeds until I've

1058
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,460
got one or two more Keepers and I can

1059
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,919
only grow so I'm gonna have five Keepers

1060
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,019
and germinate five more seeds then I'm

1061
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,639
gonna pick my favorite two out of these

1062
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:37,920
five and I'm gonna eliminate the other

1063
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,900
three and just start over so it's kind

1064
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,539
of like a bracket system uh Casting

1065
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,579
Couch audition process grow ten of them

1066
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,619
find your favorite grow ten more find

1067
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,940
your favorite compare that top one out

1068
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,220
of that one to the other top one before

1069
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,380
who wins make them battle it's a battle

1070
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,539
royale it's a bracket system I just keep

1071
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,460
going and replacing as I find something

1072
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,159
better so you can do a small Fino hunt

1073
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,838
it just takes more time so the email

1074
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,179
does go on there's more to the question

1075
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,039
it says uh if I could have a fully

1076
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,559
female population that would be better

1077
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,480
if if I could get the same results or

1078
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,000
better results from using your STS

1079
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,179
recipe and selfing a strong female from

1080
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,619
the population that would be ideal what

1081
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,940
do you think well it sounds like you've

1082
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,619
came up with part of the answer there

1083
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,900
you want all female seeds because it

1084
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:24,240
would be easier so at that point I would

1085
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,000
say grow out the entire pack and find

1086
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,338
your favorite female and then sulfur and

1087
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,559
make your own feminized seeds out of her

1088
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:33,239
that sounds like a really fun project so

1089
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,400
it sounds like the best bet for you

1090
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,039
maybe to make these Femme seeds and that

1091
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,838
strategy would be to veg out these

1092
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,059
plants get a clone from everybody put

1093
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,920
them all into flour as soon as you

1094
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:46,559
identify males get rid of the male plant

1095
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,940
get rid of the male clones uh pot those

1096
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,679
clones as soon as they're ready have

1097
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,559
them on reserve they are now your backup

1098
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,819
Keepers that's your genetic preservation

1099
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,159
uh grow out the plants that you've got

1100
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,900
in flour find your favorite female smoke

1101
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,059
them dry them cure them finish them out

1102
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,220
find your favorite female and make your

1103
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,139
selection now you've got backup clones

1104
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:06,959
toss everything accept your favorite one

1105
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,940
grow that one out make two clones of it

1106
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,199
now we're on to the selfing process

1107
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,880
you're gonna treat one with the silver

1108
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,500
you're going to pollinate the other and

1109
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,519
now you have just done your selection

1110
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,920
and made your Jack the Ripper F2 s ones

1111
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,019
for yourself now the fun part of that is

1112
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,280
growing them and seeing the uh the

1113
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:24,420
variation that does come from that

1114
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
you're not going to get that wild

1115
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,900
variation like when you cross male and

1116
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,299
female plants you're definitely not

1117
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,680
going to get that wild F2 variation but

1118
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,119
you're gonna see some cool stuff you're

1119
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,739
gonna see some of what made the Jack the

1120
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,119
Ripper some of the moms some of the dad

1121
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:38,459
and you're going to get a bunch of

1122
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,039
phenotypes that look just like that

1123
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,380
female that you selected so my friend

1124
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,000
Daft Punk's luggage I hope I answered

1125
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,559
your question I got quite rambly on this

1126
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,539
one there were a lot of good details to

1127
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,578
talk about I look forward to knowing

1128
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,900
what you decide to do with this project

1129
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,880
are you going to go with the open

1130
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,680
pollination are you going to go with

1131
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,480
selective breeding or are you going to

1132
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,940
do the feminized project it sounds kind

1133
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,500
of like the uh the open pollination and

1134
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,420
the Femme project like I said a minute

1135
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,980
ago would work hand in hand you've

1136
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,480
already got to do the final hunt let's

1137
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,579
just do the open and pollination while

1138
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,699
you're doing that you'll make so many

1139
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,140
fun seeds to play with and then then you

1140
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,419
can take your favorite one out of that

1141
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:17,460
the original batch and you can self that

1142
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,200
then also you can grow out all those

1143
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,358
seeds and find your favorite from that

1144
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:25,858
batch that you made and then you can

1145
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:28,559
self that one you can make an F3 S1 also

1146
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:30,679
then then do some plan then just start

1147
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,239
back Crossing and going back in circles

1148
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,338
you'll have a lot of fun with that if

1149
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,779
you just open it up Don't Be Afraid have

1150
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:38,940
a lot of fun if you see a plant with

1151
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,220
potential and a plant with potential put

1152
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,659
them [ __ ] together or line breed

1153
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,459
parallel lines and then breed them

1154
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,719
together in the end I give you full

1155
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,179
permission to play with the Jack the

1156
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,919
Ripper I came from sub I was given full

1157
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:52,199
permission by Miss Jill to breed with it

1158
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,579
my theory is once I make a seed I have

1159
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,779
no right in saying what you do with it

1160
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,420
if you've paid for it if you've bought

1161
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,460
it or acquired it ethically if you stole

1162
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,720
it piss off don't grow those no I know

1163
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,579
you didn't but I'm just saying if you

1164
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,019
got those seeds in an ethical manner I

1165
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,240
have no control over what you do with

1166
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:08,039
them have a bunch of fun also you got

1167
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,838
