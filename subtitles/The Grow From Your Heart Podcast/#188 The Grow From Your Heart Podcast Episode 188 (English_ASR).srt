98

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,720
slightly [ __ ] that Clint what the

129
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,058
dude that was here

130
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,059
[Music]

131
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,650
you guys are both comedians you perform

132
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,449
on stage garage you got you do bits that

133
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:57,689
are prepared and also a little bit of

134
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:01,019
improv yep we were talking earlier about

135
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,790
the use of cannabis wait I'm gonna bust

136
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,649
your balls you do smoke weed be there

137
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,319
you perform and you're pretty cool about

138
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:10,109
people knowing that I hope right so wait

139
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,389
does participate in cannabis use I see

140
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,850
your weed use is more medicinal than

141
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,589
recreational it is 100% with this yeah

142
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,790
yeah I know you it keeps my [ __ ]

143
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,799
straight man yeah you're a high-strung

144
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,090
dude yes and you're high right now and

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,270
you're still high-strung as [ __ ] I

146
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,009
walked about eight miles a day yeah the

147
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,899
students fired up and so we're talking

148
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,639
about the differences between Clint not

149
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,769
smoking because he doesn't drink or

150
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,569
smoke at all

151
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:40,319
well no there's no disrespect to you big

152
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:42,839
[ __ ] but mentioning it so do you think

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,469
that smoking before you perform your

154
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,739
show helps you out

155
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,820
or does it hinder your show so do you

156
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,030
remember when you first looked yeah do

157
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:57,599
it it takes tolerance I guess to build

158
00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:00,149
up to where you could to get past all of

159
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,560
the in the beginning like the paranoia

160
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:08,099
okay to get past the the this is

161
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,550
actually stoned and feels good so in the

162
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,350
beginning when I was get too high I

163
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,189
would sit there and lose track and lose

164
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,580
thought or maybe I wasn't in enough

165
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:22,610
situation and focus but I would learn

166
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,539
with marijuana how to do it essentially

167
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,840
okay

168
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,390
and now now I have a great little

169
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,149
medicinal level to where I sit at in

170
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:34,579
that I don't have to go overboard I

171
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:36,139
don't have to do anything like brash and

172
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,089
overmedicate because that's what you

173
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,089
want to tend to do at the beginning your

174
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:43,069
anxiety is like jacked yeah through the

175
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:46,519
roof and you're like I need I used to

176
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:49,279
suck a bowl no [ __ ] right before my set

177
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,959
I would I would leave the comic who

178
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,689
would perform for me for five minutes

179
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:57,799
and I would shock on a bowl so goddamn

180
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:59,810
fast go inside get up on stage I would

181
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,970
crowd work for the first minute of my

182
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,009
set to get over the the like the COFF

183
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,590
and the high the initial initial and

184
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,629
then I would go into my material and if

185
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:13,639
I remembered it all the way through I

186
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:17,810
would kill but then if I didn't yeah

187
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,599
then it sucked so how long did it take

188
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,250
to find your threshold for more because

189
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,300
I'm a musician yeah I know that same

190
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,069
threshold okay

191
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,930
I can't keep time if I get too high and

192
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,790
I know that and you get panicky of

193
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,340
course start doing dumb [ __ ] on stage to

194
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,930
try to cover how long did it take you to

195
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,029
find your little threshold zone to where

196
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,299
you knew how high you could be I'm gonna

197
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,159
say a good eight months like were you

198
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,250
smoking the first time you performed

199
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,049
comedy were you high yes okay yeah

200
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,059
extremely okay so you didn't have to

201
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,559
learn how to do comedy and be high at

202
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,419
separate times you just you were already

203
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,809
high doing it your first time I have a

204
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:55,669
little bit of a lucky background of

205
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:57,559
being sort of a public speaker I was in

206
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:02,750
management for a little while and I also

207
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:04,549
did acting so the acting thing like I

208
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,179
just started smoking weed two years ago

209
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:10,189
like on the rig we took away - the way

210
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:12,409
was kind of an amateur until he went to

211
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,730
the secret a lot of but he was a huge

212
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:17,029
amateur I would he would come over and

213
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,800
hang out I would give him dabs a1 one

214
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,329
day it would [ __ ] him up for the

215
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,059
afternoon he told me that he took a nap

216
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,580
for eight hours and stuff so we took him

217
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:27,289
to the secret cup and he sat next to me

218
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,879
at the secret cup where we were

219
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,169
down and I looked at him and I told him

220
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,299
pretty much you're in the big leagues

221
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,610
buddy and I started giving him man dabs

222
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,289
yes and from then on I quit giving him

223
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,970
the little amateur dad's I decided he

224
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:41,360
got his purple about that day yeah and

225
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:45,670
so two years from till now Doody really

226
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,680
stepped up the game well it's uh I love

227
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:51,828
and I feel like I gave it an unfair shot

228
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:54,049
for only 34 years of my life so I'm

229
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:56,750
giving it all fair shots if I can and it

230
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,419
improves everything that I've done so

231
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,419
far because I know a lot of people say

232
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,899
that it it makes you go all over the

233
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,778
place

234
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,690
but for someone like me that is wired

235
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm already all over all over the place

236
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,120
so what marijuana does for me is focus

237
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,879
more than anything I tell me more about

238
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,528
that first 34 years that you said you

239
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,350
were biased on marijuana I [ __ ] hated

240
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:25,338
all of you all of us potheads yes why I

241
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,860
would specifically blame it on my on my

242
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,360
brother going back to high school my

243
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,310
brother was scouted by like major

244
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,889
Division one universities for football

245
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:38,049
when he was in seventh grade started

246
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:40,009
smoking weed around ninth grade and he

247
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:43,578
gradually declined to where he quit

248
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:46,039
playing football by his junior senior

249
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:48,769
year and I blamed marijuana a lot for

250
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,870
this because I watched his life and I

251
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,399
watched my life and then I watched a lot

252
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,560
of my friends around me that smoked weed

253
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,620
and everything like that and I was I was

254
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,379
very judgmental of all of them and I

255
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,060
found out it wasn't just it wasn't weed

256
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,629
they were just losers and I was a

257
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,250
douchebag

258
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,189
now that's a personality trait and

259
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,049
that's all it was it really was so and

260
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,180
that was just us as young kids and that

261
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:14,509
was me in my 20s and then and then I

262
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:17,179
went to Vegas and in Las Vegas I was a

263
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:19,100
four years to get away from my ex-fiance

264
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,769
which I decided to keep around in my

265
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:26,079
life for several years afterwards which

266
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:28,399
led to me doing about three

267
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,588
antipsychotics a couple antidepressants

268
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,889
and a couple of sleeping medications a

269
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,600
day to calm down these major hives that

270
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,659
would break out all over my body

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:44,000
all prescribed all prescribed

272
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:48,049
good question absolutely yes they this

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,639
was all given to me to initially get rid

274
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:51,589
of these hives that were breaking out

275
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,509
all over my body at random times in

276
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,649
situation that were just from anxiety

277
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,759
correctly okay but but no one knew

278
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,679
dermatologist and no regular doctors

279
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,840
finally someone said go see a shrink I

280
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,309
was like great I'm gonna go see a shrink

281
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,210
and they're like you [ __ ] up I was

282
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:12,439
like finally I knew it so they put me on

283
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,240
all this [ __ ] and I would find myself at

284
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,720
a stoplight and I'm driving my truck

285
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,879
right and I've got this smile on my face

286
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:25,040
but inside my head I'm like why I

287
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,080
there's no I'm not I'm not happy for any

288
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,269
reason sad pretty reason either there's

289
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,259
just there's no that I I'm not I'm not

290
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:35,269
this I'm not this and then like Oh turn

291
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:38,330
on the shower and just forget that it

292
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:41,449
was on and not in the weed way but just

293
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,940
it was on and then I found myself

294
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,470
needing like klonopin what was one the

295
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,660
specific one that I knew that worked

296
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,029
like they could immediately get rid of

297
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:53,709
the hives both gone later what is what

298
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:56,929
is the klonopin is an anti anti anxiety

299
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,480
okay and antipsychotic I believe is what

300
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:02,569
they used before so like it immediately

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,889
can calm down some anxiety man and it

302
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:10,370
worked for me but it didn't work for me

303
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:13,100
you know so I moved from Vegas went to

304
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,340
New Orleans when I got to New Orleans I

305
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,920
no longer had the insurance but no

306
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,670
longer the will to actually like take

307
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,539
these pills

308
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:28,789
I hate being slaves to things in my life

309
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:32,659
so I quit and a year or so went by and I

310
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:34,939
knew that I still needed something so I

311
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:37,069
finally decided being in New Orleans

312
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,320
marijuana is prevalent down there

313
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,210
although it is very expensive because it

314
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,620
can be rare no you can't really grow it

315
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,150
down there if they don't [ __ ] your [ __ ]

316
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,919
up dude bet I said I'm gonna try weed

317
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,929
and I'm gonna I'm gonna give it

318
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,169
a control point you know I'm gonna try

319
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,789
this many times and if I hate it I'm

320
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,979
gonna get past it that's called the old

321
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:00,778
college try well and I just wanted to be

322
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,690
educated about it you know I was like I

323
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:07,559
don't want to be stupid I'm 30 at the

324
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,050
time I'm 34 and I'm going to be smart

325
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,828
about this

326
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:15,719
it took three two-and-a-half tries and I

327
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:17,789
was like I don't need I don't need any

328
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,000
more to know that this is good for me

329
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:25,649
and and I haven't stopped good for you

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,649
how good for me in the know anxiety like

331
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,958
the anxiety that I have now is justified

332
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,339
like I'm about ready to go on stage in

333
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:40,588
front of like maybe a hundred people

334
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:42,660
with words that like even the tested

335
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,660
stuff I don't know if it's gonna ever

336
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,708
eat I'm in a different town in a

337
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,169
different town that doesn't know

338
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,929
references that maybe I've grown up with

339
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:55,110
well not even not even that just the

340
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:57,389
audience and that's why like the Pueblo

341
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,399
seems so different is because we we only

342
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,899
have a couple of spots so it's always

343
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,659
it's kind of always the same audience

344
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,519
yeah so you want to write new stuff yeah

345
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,750
but but when you're moving out and the

346
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,250
stuff that does work down here you're

347
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,690
thinking oh good I get to go use it up

348
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,299
there they've never heard the stuff yeah

349
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,940
100% and I and I completely but it's

350
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,979
never a hundred percent by taking a

351
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,680
knife to a gunfight up their body you

352
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,839
could be I mean you just even on a good

353
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:27,028
room you know well here's how it's

354
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,410
justified anxiety yeah well in here's

355
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:31,289
how it helps me now throughout the day

356
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:35,039
and outside of company I wake up at 5:00

357
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:38,939
a.m. every morning I go to bed around

358
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:48,659
11:00 to midnight I don't have children

359
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:51,540
I'm single I sleep for like five hours

360
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,370
asleep and it's because like the

361
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,948
corporate world teaches you how to be

362
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,720
this machine it's perfect if you were in

363
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:59,429
the military also correct so the two of

364
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,160
them have got you kind of robot mode but

365
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,049
but they don't teach you how to not be a

366
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,818
machine so they don't teach you how to

367
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:07,500
shut it off because they wants you

368
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:09,539
thinking about work all the time and I

369
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,708
would be and I still do now so like I

370
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:15,719
consumed myself with all these not only

371
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,689
my comedy but all my [ __ ] up thoughts

372
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,939
like everybody else has and they keep me

373
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,899
awake and I wake up at 5:00 a.m. and if

374
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:26,490
I don't smoke weed let like I

375
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,828
immediately wake up and walk five miles

376
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,110
and that's no lie and I'm heavily

377
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:38,879
sedated so would you be an advocate that

378
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:40,620
cannabis does help PTSD because yeah so

379
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,870
there are states that are not allowing

380
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,519
that as a reason a valid reason for

381
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,959
medical marijuana so anybody that's

382
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,839
listening you just heard wait

383
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,789
mostly describe to PTSD and depression

384
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,430
depression 100% is what his cannabis

385
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:55,230
uses is helping do you I know you're new

386
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,429
and you're you hang out with me and a

387
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,480
couple other guys that are kind of we

388
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,549
know what's going on do you have a

389
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,480
strain that works best for you or a

390
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:11,009
strain that doesn't work for you and I

391
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:12,870
know you you're not as well-versed the

392
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,000
best the last best thing that I've tried

393
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,139
out of from from the samples that I've

394
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,939
tried the veganic lemon Jeffrey no lie

395
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,669
broke some [ __ ] off nice like that some

396
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,120
[ __ ] it really is that's mostly sativa

397
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:29,220
it's almost a pure sativa

398
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,439
dab wise you're not beating your

399
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,600
grateful dog or your Girl Scout cookies

400
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,070
hands down okay and weed why's that GSC

401
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,119
show me something show me something

402
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,859
that's going up against that [ __ ] that

403
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,418
Girl Scout cookies is a hell of a strain

404
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,389
I wish I would have read that I didn't

405
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,490
know that [ __ ] dude so I wanted to talk

406
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,450
a little bit more I'm gonna whisper

407
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,558
something to you because I want to know

408
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,548

409
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:55,289
something yeah yeah yeah okay I want to

410
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:57,729
talk about some lab testing right quick

411
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,858
as you said that lemon Jeffrey ideas

412
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:03,369
samples to steep hill Halen labs in

413
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:05,228
Denver and the lemon Jeffrey I was doing

414
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:08,199
Paganica Lee it was bred by me grown by

415
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:12,278
me I we hit twenty four point three four

416
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,739
percent THC a total cannabinoid content

417
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:15,669
on that was twenty six point oh let me

418
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:17,828
make sure I'm not lying

419
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,440
it's twenty five point three sorry it's

420
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:22,739
really small prayer phone 25.3%

421
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,328
cannabinoids on the lemon Jeffrey

422
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:27,190
searching my phone I'm looking for the

423
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:28,569
Grateful dog we've got several tests in

424
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,828
here here's the Grateful dog when the

425
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,819
four point eight I think it was

426
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:33,338
something similar to that

427
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:36,418
yeah really close twenty-three point

428
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:38,798
three two thca and then for a total of

429
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,479
twenty four point three yeah that's the

430
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,469
Grateful dog so the strains were

431
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,729
breathing that you guys are getting a

432
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:45,940
smoke around here you're getting spoiled

433
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:48,308
there dude alright so for us amateurs

434
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,009
and let's go over a couple of basics

435
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:54,398
here I like you know yeah cuz um I'm

436
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:57,399
gonna ask when you say THC I know I know

437
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:58,928
a lot of us know what THC is but just to

438
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:00,908
start out with some guys may be from

439
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,129
wherever that don't know

440
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:04,539
THC being the thing that gets you high

441
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:06,608
correct yes

442
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:08,378
there are several active cannabinoids

443
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:09,968
I'm actually trying to get to the steep

444
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:12,939
hill web site while I'm doing this so

445
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:14,139
that we can maybe they have a chart of

446
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,729
cannabinoids on there to give me a

447
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:17,738
little bit of a guide okay it'd be

448
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:19,419
really cool to see yeah and then and

449
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,459
then cannabinoids was my other question

450
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,139
was so the cannabinoids are the part

451
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,788
that they work in conjunction with

452
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:26,678
terpenoids flavonoids and a few other

453
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,088
molecules but it's mostly cannabinoids

454
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,359
that we're looking for and these are

455
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:34,509
molecules yes essentially essentially

456
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:36,098
and so they call them compounds as what

457
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,108
I think they actually call them okay I'm

458
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:39,668
not a scientist but I buy stay more in

459
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:43,148
the grow room but what I play one on TV

460
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:50,739
that's right I stated a holiday in these

461
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:55,408
guys to do the test hotel for 24 they

462
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:58,798
test for CBG a CBG THC THCA

463
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:08,460
THC v THC by itself

464
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:11,579
dat HC th cv cbn a CBN CBD a CBD CBC

465
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,960
c.b.c oh there's a negative sign I don't

466
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,730
know what that negative sign means but

467
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,170
for the most part that we were looking

468
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:21,870
for honestly was the THC the THC a those

469
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,700
are all cannabinoid the the CBD yeah

470
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,819
those are the basic cannabinoids the THC

471
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,279
is the one that gives you the head high

472
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,579
that makes you kind of it's like more

473
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,099
psychedelic the CBD is the one that's

474
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,019
more body oriented more analgesic more

475
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,719
relaxing and the CBD is what's helping

476
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,410
wait the the opposite is the one that's

477
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,670
all correct

478
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:46,320
yeah THC oh really because I think it

479
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,630
lifts your brain up out of the

480
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,569
depression it's uplifting it just bends

481
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,310
you up out of it the CBD however is the

482
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:55,319
one that they're giving to kids for

483
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:58,230
seizures and epilepsy problems and

484
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,990
autism and tumors and such and that is

485
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,960
getting rid or stopping cancer and a lot

486
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,910
of people as CBD CBD rich medicine so

487
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,769
I'm gonna brag here I've got a cut that

488
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,080
was given to me from my friend Joey at

489
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,789
natural mystic cannabis caregivers he

490
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,509
got it from our good friends at DNA

491
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,559
genetics

492
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:19,440
I drew this tora bora came in the THC

493
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,779
not impressive four point nine seven but

494
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,670
the CBD content on this bad dog was

495
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,460
eight point five six percent it's the

496
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,990
phone it's a two to one CBD to THC ratio

497
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,490
which means this is perfect for those

498
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,640
sick folks that don't want to get high

499
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,829
one person need some medicine okay this

500
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,120
is the one we've got a patient a friend

501
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:37,859
of mine good brother who's going through

502
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,719
some turmoil right now with his health

503
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,909
but he came over and we've talked about

504
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,769
it he didn't feel good he was on a cane

505
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,230
he felt like [ __ ] mentally physically

506
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:48,509
and we had some dabs of that tora bora

507
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,490
and stood up and forgot his cane and got

508
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:53,960
all the way up the stairs and turned

509
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,960
around and shouted we bring me my cane

510
00:21:55,069 --> 00:22:00,869
visualize myself

511
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:05,639
yeah when so so it sounds like 25 is

512
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:07,789
huge as a THC content that's a that's a

513
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,460
good good reference point to ask for uh

514
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:13,079
high anything over the guy told me

515
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,720
anything over thirteen percent is

516
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,789
considered high whoa but the growers and

517
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,200
breeders and dispensary guys we look for

518
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,019
anything eighteen to twenty

519
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,990
one is satisfactory some of the highest

520
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:28,230
s-- there's reports of 29s and 30s but

521
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,388
that's questionable 26 and 27 are

522
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,099
remarkable my good buddy Spencer I'm

523
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:41,209

529
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,500
nine the one that's impressive I'm

530
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,918
looking for it

531
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,169
Spence grew rianne's Rhino from another

532
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,490
breeder and that hit twenty five point

533
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:07,320
nine percent THC the total was twenty

534
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,970
seven point two with three point one

535
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,678
percent terpenoids in it and i didn't

536
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,240
even pay him to test her the terpenoids

537
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,700
they were just so blown away that they

538
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,788
wanted to do no [ __ ] so if somebody had

539
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,259
won would we direct them to that website

540
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,849
or something if they wanted to get their

541
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,288
stuff tested since they're being pretty

542
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:25,709
cool about testing your stuff you know

543
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm affiliated with labs and things or

544
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,730
with dispensaries and things and they

545
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,710
just kind of changed the rules like two

546
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,269
days ago so we're now you have to be a

through the testing facilities the [ __ ]

549
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,829
yeah [ __ ] you we'll talk about that on

550
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,500
the over-regulation is costing

551
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:45,689
legalization so I want to give Spencer

552
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,398

there needs to be something higher

590
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:19,330

only get back to wade for one second I

610
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,950
asked for permission can I mention your

611
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:17,379
dad dude you know 100 percent Wade's dad

612
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,640
is an elderly gentleman I've honestly

613
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,309
never met him but I've been heavily

614
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,679
involved with 78 78 years old I've been

615
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:27,908
kind of helping these guys figure out

616
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,100
and guide his a short stint with medical

617
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,900
marijuana use mm-hmm I heard that the

618
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:33,668
old guy was having problems and I kind

619
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,288
of jokingly said give him some pot

620
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:37,360
cookies or something and Wade was like

621
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,779
no I want to but my mom disagrees with

622
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,109
it

623
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,759
mm-hmm so after some persuasion I took

624
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,859
about three months three months of

625
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,200
persuasion on mom

626
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,269
research and then tell them what

627
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,039
actually I think will actually sent them

628
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:51,599
over the convincing edge to let him do

629
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,259
it and I'm referring to the Facebook oh

630
00:26:51,599 --> 00:27:01,789
yeah but I did or remember he was the

631
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:03,619
brave I asked well I made them so

632
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:06,149
[Music]

633
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:07,949
basically attacking my dad are not

634
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,690
attacking but the plan of attack for my

635
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,539
dad was having as much information as I

636
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:15,720
could and having as much information I

637
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,548
could it is hard for someone who a is

638
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,069
not familiar I guess you could say

639
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:21,539
what's the type of contacts to get such

640
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:23,099
information I mean you could look it all

641
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,659
up and everything like that but when it

642
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,798
comes down to it there's a lot of people

643
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,690
that are gonna be coming in from out of

644
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,480
the state that will look at the products

645
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,779
and be like I love it but I really don't

646
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,849
know what I'm getting so I didn't want

647
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,558
that to happen

648
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:40,409
anyone did not have that information and

649

673
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,019
by a doctor that really doesn't give a

674
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:44,369
[ __ ] about you and and he's given them

675
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,319
to you because

676
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,119
the the people that are telling him to

677
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,808

and he took a man he took him for about

683
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:08,069
two and a half to three months he was

684
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,298
doing edibles strong and then I think my

685
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:14,038
mom got involved yeah he was showing

686
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:16,940
signs of having too much fun at Walmart

687
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:20,548
is one of the conversation wonder 100%

688
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,960
100% you know what though if somebody's

689
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:26,548
having fun at Walmart there's something

690
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:30,740
wrong well well no I agree right no my

691
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:34,379
mom was like me my mom wasn't used to

692
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,960
the adjustment period of getting high so

693
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,299
my dad is is learning how to get high

694
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,590
and he's 78 years old and these

695
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:47,879
receptors have never been you huh

696
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:49,579
so he's taken an edible and he's high

697
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,220
and here's like I don't think I'm high

698
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:55,230
could you pass me some water you know

699
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,269
and you're like you're [ __ ] high well

700
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,038
at least it's water and not more yeah

701
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,740
right because as we discussed on the

702
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,929
last pot this is this is don't take two

703
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,000
it did happen this is what did happen so

704
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:08,159
he was like he's gonna feel like the

705
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,558
pills make me feel I was like whole

706
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,299
[ __ ] let's go you know I was like you

707
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,009
could just bite off as much as that [ __ ]

708
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:15,808
if you want dad it's not gonna kill you

709
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:17,759
yeah you may freak out a little I was a

710
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:20,009
that's I said yeah I was like be careful

711
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,009
you know it's like you if you like it go

712
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:24,329
for it if you don't then take a nap bro

713
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:24,658
cuz that's probably what you want to do

714
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,699
anyway

715
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,820
you're old we went from getting him the

716
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:34,470
pure CBD well I was Wade kind of tasked

717
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:36,210
me for being in charge I knew that was

718
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,798
my job you know yeah in this circle

719
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,630
that's my job your old man sick you're

720
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,490
thinking about we'd come to me I'll talk

721
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,860
to you about it as a caregiver yeah

722
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,740
you're a good guy and so I went to I

723
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,119
obtained the proper CBD dosage I thought

724
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,558
he would want and the old guys like I

725
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,089
want to get [ __ ] up a little bit I'm

726
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,639
old I missing that head spin from the

727
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:56,279
pigs exactly we've got a little bit of

728
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,560
THC and he's like bring it he kept up

729
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:00,839
he's like more THC and then till finally

730
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,179
mama cut him off apparently in it's

731
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,279
because she doesn't know she was the

732
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,490
only one not in the party basically yeah

733
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,990
because my dad would walk you know and

734
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,120
he'd just kind of stand there and he's

735
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,069
just kind of chilling and he's just not

736
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,829
really you know he's not being a

737
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:24,750
crab-ass so my mom thinks something's

738
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:26,339
wrong just quit [ __ ] that box of

739
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:34,079
macaroni and cheese like it's heaven

740
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:36,750
because man you know not only did it

741
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,419
help because he was a well he didn't my

742
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,940
father has to take a nap every day has

743
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,279
to it's got to be about a three-hour two

744
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,980
four four hour and a half every day so

745
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:50,399
he can get through the whole day when he

746
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,460
was on the edibles didn't have to take a

747
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:58,019
nap you know active his mood was better

748
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:00,390
uh he was acting like he was like a

749
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,480
human not to say that he suffered

750
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,250
without we did the time you guys spent

751
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,750
while you were high together improve oh

752
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,650
excuse me I'm burping improve your

753
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:18,210
relationship at all

754
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:22,140
wait a minute I'm sorry TMZ if that's

755
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:25,620
too much I could tell you this much 100%

756
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,030
I have about zero conversation serious

757
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,250
conversations with my father especially

758
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:31,259
about a his health I've never really

759
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,180
given it is cannabis topic is mostly all

760
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,980
I've heard about your father utilities

761
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,769
yeah I agree

762
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,579
yeah I don't it's not it's not a subject

763
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:44,220
that I approach he is the let's just say

764
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:47,429
there's a reason why comics are comics

765
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,900
he's got a lot to do with okay so when

766
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,650
he's high did he quit you said he wasn't

767
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,750
a crab-ass no he was you could tell the

768
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,660
do you could tell how pills affect the

769
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,839
attitude yeah right so when you take

770
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,820
oxycontin all day long and your brain is

771
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,049
just tired of it those receptors in your

772
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:07,669
brain when you wake up the next morning

773
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:11,509
they're burnt but but your body wants it

774
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:14,060
you hurt another one well not only do

775
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:16,160
you hurt but your addiction hurts too so

776
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:17,720
your receptors are like I need this but

777
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,269
then I need more of it

778
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,000
but you're draining the melatonin in

779
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:25,129
your body the entire time and this is

780
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,640
like and at that time that affects your

781
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,710
your entire attitude man and you can see

782
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,720
it you can see it in old people they're

783
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,730
[ __ ] mean all the time because

784
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,769
they're up on oxycotin so it's trying to

785
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,660
find a happy medium between a couple of

786
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,690
pills and half a tube at you forum or

787
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,029
something to where mama thinks oh here's

788
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:46,039
here's what was going down he would go

789
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:49,099
to Walmart and when he would take the

790
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:52,309
pills you know he's zipping around but

791
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:56,089
he doesn't know he's hurt when he's on

792
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:59,169
the pills when he'd take the weed he's

793
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:02,269
on the weed but he's aware of his pain

794
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:04,640
you know what I'm saying yeah so when

795
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:06,799
he's aware of his pain he's acting in a

796
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,539
different way and my mother did not does

797
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,029
not know how to handle that the

798
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:14,300
transition for her for someone that is a

799
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:18,320
nonsmoker to see someone of 40 years her

800
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,360
husband that is now trying to be

801
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,200
introduced into this culture that she

802
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,419
had to be conned into oh yeah they grew

803
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,399
up in the time or marriage itself she

804
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:31,099
admits that freely she's like listen I

805
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,260
don't like it because reefer madness the

806
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:35,779
exact quote yeah that's programmed into

807
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,060
her head dude and she hates it because

808
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,790
her best friend's a hippie and she's

809
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,980
like [ __ ] yeah give him that [ __ ] shout

810
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:44,659

811
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,300
so I said I was gonna find a cannabinoid

812
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,159
chart found this little cool pie chart

813
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,330
if you've got an Apple computer it looks

814
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,299
like that [ __ ] thing that spins

815
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:55,610
around every time you use iTunes that's

816
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,360
a pie chart kids they graduate from East

817
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:01,890
High School you don't know

818
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:04,460
but we know so CBD takes over more than

819
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:07,859
half of the pizza pie here and the

820
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,090
symptoms that CBD can benefit I can't

821
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,820
even print out some of them so

822
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:16,230
antipsychotic anti epileptic

823
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:21,050
neuroprotective anti-spasmodics anti-ice

824
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:26,269
semuc anti-cancer anti a medic

825
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:29,610

826
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:33,210
sporadic analgesic Bone stimulant anti

827
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:37,349
inflammatory t-cell increase oh that's

828
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,449
huge immunosuppressive adeno sign up

829
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:42,230
take and there are other words that I

830
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:47,969
honestly I'm not even gonna say good job

831
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:52,340
we only CBD CBD v specifically points to

832
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:57,239
bone stimulant Delta 9 THC a anti

833
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:00,300
proliferative antispasmodic there's one

834
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,889
that unfortunately the text is the same

835
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,900
color as the piece of the pie chart so

836
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:06,420
we'll never know what which mark which

837
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,750
article or molecule that is I think if I

838
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,450
highlighted with my mice yeah maybe I

839
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,800
know it's not that type of page okay

840
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:16,559
nice try though now I gotta [ __ ]

841
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:20,220
figure out how to zoom out right here

842
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:23,940
it's got the - alright CBG I've never

843
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:25,559
known what CBG was antimicrobial bone

844
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,750
stimulant analgesic and

845
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,940
anti-inflammatory so I'm thinking

846
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,139
antimicrobial if you've got some mold

847
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,269
infection in your lungs

848
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,909
start smoking some CBG heavy medicine

849
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:37,559
the anti-inflammatory is if you turn

850
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,089
that if the if you believe in the

851
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,179
analgesic like they said like you could

852
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,980
run on out but you could rub like if you

853
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:47,099
believe in the rubs I guess do you

854
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,780
believe in the ropes that's not what I'm

855
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,880
aiming for I'm a pothead and a dabber

856
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:57,180
got a fear I believe that if you believe

857
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,860
they work they do okay I'm not sure I'm

858
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,179
not I don't know I don't get anything

859
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,180
from it because I smoke too much

860
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,570
[Music]

861
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:09,009
CBG is a bone stimulant antibacterial

862
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,838
anti-poll if it is okay

863
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:13,929
and then there's a line coming off of

864
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,619
Delta 9 THC V and C B G that I think is

865
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:19,858
anti epileptic that is both of them o

866
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:23,979
Bone stimulant for the Delta 9 THC V

867
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:31,150
anorectic what does that that's what you

868
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:33,848
can't get an erection those are just a

869
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,259
few from one little pie chart of from

870
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:38,289
the different cannabinoids of what they

871
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:40,478
benefit and how they can yeah and this

872
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:42,759
came from trends in pharmaceutical

873
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:44,588
Pharma it's really tall small print

874
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:45,699
pharmacological sciences there's more

875
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,659
apparent that I can't even read but

876
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,788
that's where this little chart comes

877
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:50,348
from we tweet that out on the girl

878
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:51,999
culture maybe a link to that I've got a

879
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,950
better one in my phone that I'll tweet

880
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:55,328
but I didn't want to dig for that one in

881
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,669
my phone it looks really shitty to be on

882
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:58,959
the phone well it encourages you

883
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,119
[ __ ] to get on the phone it's mainly

884
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,679

892

894
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:28,659

895

umm I get really nervous up until I hit

899
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:39,339
the stage okay and then once I'm there

900
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:41,199
it's just yeah what I'm already here

901
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:42,369
you're already up in front of people it

902
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,278
doesn't matter and I have a background

903
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,719
in acting as well I'm not good acting a

904
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:50,440
little bit of theatre keep your clothes

905
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,599
on okay no no I can't seem to do that no

906
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,729
but I have like just short films and

907
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,430
then a little bit of stage time on

908
00:38:54,728 --> 00:39:00,068
theater stuff and you know being a

909
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:01,838
frontman for a metal band so I never had

910
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:04,119
a problem getting up in front of people

911
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,608
the hardest part is getting started like

912
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,259
almost anything in life yeah seeing that

913
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:13,199
first joke in front of somebody has got

914
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:15,969
to be a friend do it last night man that

915
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,619
he was pacing I think he listens to this

916
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:20,650
show yes he does

917
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,440
usually he went for his very first time

918
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,900
last night and watching him do it he did

919
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,889
not want to smoke weed before and he

920
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,559
didn't drink before what's good

921
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:37,750
immediately after he finished

922
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:39,759
give me that [ __ ] J he crushed

923
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,010
all right no he did great he did

924
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,840
absolutely great but it is something

925
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:48,100
where I if I was having those symptoms

926
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,590
that would be something that I'm glad

927
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:53,199
that this helps you you know it's not

928
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:56,829
something that I feel like I need but I

929
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,719
wonder how how it would affect me I'm

930
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:00,610
not gonna find out because it's not

931
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,699
something I need to do I've already been

932
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:08,170
addicted to far too many things Prozac

933

935
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:15,849

936
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,259
antidepressant okay um but I but like

on to do a little bit of cannabis 101

970
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:34,150
yeah quickly scramble through your phone

971
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:35,769
and find a question all right so class

972
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,849
is in session shoot me a question bro

973
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:38,889
we'll try to answer it for the noobs

974
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:40,239
well I'm glad we went over THC levels

975
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,710
cuz that was one of the questions I had

976
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,319
you know that's something that that I

977
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,119
don't think a lot of people know and but

978
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,190
with weight I don't know if I asked it

979
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,739
last time but with THC levels for a

980
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,420
newcomer you know what what levels would

981
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:54,489
they be looking at you know is that

982
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,889
something that even they is that

983
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:58,119
something they do it dispensaries okay

984
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,699
Clint's never even walked into a

985
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,710
dispensary yeah do they have THC levels

986
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:04,179
on the some of the shops will have the

987
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,740
THC level printed the higher class

988
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:08,099
places will but it's expensive to get

989
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:10,179
the test done okay some of them

990
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,319
unfortunately will put a higher level to

991
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:15,969
mislead you decide a side question do

992
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,300
you believe that there will be a future

993
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:22,480
regulation of marijuana good question

994
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,519
they're already trying to outlaw in

995
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,710
Amsterdam you can't have cannabis over

996
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:31,300
15 or 17 percent on the shelves in the

997
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:33,250
coffee shop so they're doing it like we

998
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,289
work I don't think it'll come to that

999
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,510
here in the states they are trying to

1000
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:41,199
ban dabs in California from what I just

1001
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:43,450
wrote everything true that's true which

1002
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,559
uh-oh all that does we know that's you

1003
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:45,879
know what happens when you [ __ ]

1004
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,440
outlaw [ __ ] I don't even need to go and

1005
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,079
draw abyssion prohibition sort of

1006
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,460
speeches so when you go into the shops a

1007
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,659
lot of times they do have the THC

1008
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,849
content listed on the strain

1009
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:56,589
unfortunately they'll grow one strain

1010
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:57,969
for a year and they get one batch tested

1011
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,800
and they claim that it's that THC

1012
00:42:57,969 --> 00:43:02,079
percent the whole time correct there's

1013
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,700
nobody in the future we will be required

1014
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,840
to test everything that's on every shelf

1015
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:06,489
that goes out of every door and every

1016
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,900
dispense it's pretty dude that's pretty

1017
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:12,639
much how it should be a little bit so

1018
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:14,980
sure now yeah I mean like everything but

1019
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,629
cigarettes here right yeah yeah right I

1020
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,460
mean and we don't want to be classified

1021
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,460
as cigarettes honestly and if you I say

1022
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,900
we very loosely cuz I know I'm not a man

1023
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,730
you're part of the community well I am

1024
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,470
supporting it you are you're here but I

1025
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,880
don't want anything to people to think

1026
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:29,019
oh it's like cigarettes because they

1027
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,610
don't have to like they don't have this

1028
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,409
regulation and I would rather we had the

1029
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,800
regulation on it I don't like the way

1030
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,759
that they said

1031
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,170
treat it like alcohol and the

1032
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,240
regulations because that made it feel

1033
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,460
skeezy to me but you did work it did

1034
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:44,099
work unfortunate well you know what and

1035
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,119
I was a proponent of saying you know if

1036
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,960
you're gonna treat it like anything

1037
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,839
treated like alcohol but then after

1038
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,179
after like 16 months of smoke and it's a

1039
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,380
the complete wrong mentality to take

1040
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:57,059
towards it right and I'm gonna write

1041
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,559
myself a note cuz I want to talk more

1042
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,000
about this but you guys kind of put me

1043
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,549
off on something I wanted to kind of

1044
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,739
sidebar on yeah so if you go into the

1045
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,150
dispensary anything is gonna be if it's

1046
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,939
well grown you're gonna hit fifteen

1047
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,800
seventeen percent THC hopefully like the

1048
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,780
dispensaries if you're lucky you're

1049
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,630
gonna find a twenty two and that's

1050
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,670
that's not super far apart honestly I've

1051
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,710
seen both I've smoked both and it's very

1052
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,050
my new and it's also the lab that tested

1053
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,639
it some labs you can kind of if you

1054
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,370
buddy up and build a relationship your

1055
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,900
numbers seem to go higher and there's

1056
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,000
some labs I know will not do that

1057
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,420
because they have high integrity [ __ ]

1058
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,849
yeah yes so thank goodness if you're a

1059
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,280
noob like two or three good hits off of

1060
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:39,929
a bowl like if you're a smoke if it's

1061
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,730
your first time one or two good hits off

1062
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,750
of a bowl of twenty percent THC weed

1063
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,210
will get you stoned

1064
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,710
you'll get red-eyed and cottonmouth two

1065
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,349
or three good hits and you'll be like

1066
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,349
sucked to the couch forever yeah so just

1067
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:54,360
start with one yes anything just start

1068
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,940
with one yeah don't be the people that

1069
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,440
buy an entire [ __ ] TKO bar and an

1070
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,539
eighth and then go smoke a bowl and then

1071
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,980
eat the [ __ ] TKO bar and do something

1072
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,679
dumb and make us I'm gonna try one of

1073
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:08,460
those the tiki bars or I haven't tried

1074
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:10,199
to many of the the brand-name edibles I

1075
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,300
guess you can say just because I would

1076
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,939
rather spend my money on the flower yeah

1077
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,470
she was the TKO one I know you talked

1078
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,019
about this on a previous podcast maybe

1079
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:21,209
two or three I wasn't it was not tested

1080
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:24,449
I have tested those and I would have

1081
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:26,550
[ __ ] testify that that [ __ ] works

1082
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:34,409
I will also testify that it works on

1083
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:36,000

milligram cookie I think it kicked in

1091
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,100
after the show and I fell asleep we're

1092

like you're floating already on an

1110
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,519

Denver to handle some business you take

1117

1127
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,930
mean like you were high throughout the

1128
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,119
show on the cookie and then once you hit

1129
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:30,329
the dab it was like I'm done is that

1130
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,690
what you're saying or were you guys

1131
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:36,389
smoking I guess my real question is is

1132
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:39,450
how long did it take for the cookie to

1133
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:41,609
kick in or do you not over an hour

1134
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:42,899
easily for me it's like about an hour

1135
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,870
and a half and see and that's something

1136
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,990
I'm trying to get out as don't if it's

1137
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:50,519
not gonna work immediately don't just

1138
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:52,679
take more and expect it to work

1139
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:54,900
agreed that's that's that's one of my

1140
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:55,389
main focuses people to not overdo

1141
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,880
something

1142
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:59,980
here for me it's like is so this is

1143
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,960
where like when dabs come in for me it's

1144
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,389
just like whenever I take a dab the very

1145
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,548
like a big damp right when Jeff puts a

1146
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:07,960
man dab up in front of me the only thing

1147
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,219
I think in my head which I know is

1148
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,869
impossible and I would just like to

1149
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,759
preface this by saying that but the only

1150
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:15,010
way it goes on my head is like is this I

1151
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,420
just don't want to be the first person

1152
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:21,039
to die that's all let's I don't want to

1153
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,559
be that dude that's like well wait

1154
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,740
Ridley died from marijuana and now

1155
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:28,660

1158
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:37,690

1159
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:39,369

dispensary however they had plenty of

1172
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,599
recreational marijuana which is about 25

1173
00:49:20,588 --> 00:49:26,699
percent more in regular price just off

1174

to [ __ ] talk about that that's [ __ ]

1192
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,720
up we didn't legalize cannabis to

1193
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:09,338
abandon the people that

1194
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,828
well your honor footing here's what

1195
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:13,960
they'll say is it's free market you know

1196
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:15,780
what I'm saying is it's free market it

1197
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,960
is but it's [ __ ] up it is

1198
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,619
disrespectful

1199
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,358
hey if if you keep punching me an eye

1200
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:23,680
and I don't say dude quit [ __ ]

1201
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:24,608
punching me and I you'll keep doing it

1202
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:26,588
all day yeah

1203
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:27,608
so I somebody's got to say quit [ __ ]

1204
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:29,710
punching the patient's in the eye

1205
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,920
because they're the ones that got this

1206
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,240
going they're the ones that need this

1207
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,889
where somebody's got to be responsible

1208
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,750
and I can do what I could do I have a

1209
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:39,159
big mouth and I've got a podcast feed

1210
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,568
and people listen and we can try to

1211
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:42,789
figure out what we can do to prevent it

1212
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:44,050
or something it sucks I think the

1213
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,150
patients are the ones that got us going

1214
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,640
dude but definitely well know that

1215
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,800
that's a more than accurate statement I

1216
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,469
would say like it medical marijuana was

1217
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,810
so when I lived in New Orleans

1218
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:59,230
medical marijuana was active here when I

1219
00:50:55,809 --> 00:51:01,088
moved back it's really it's recreational

1220
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,619
and legal for everyone it's not like it

1221
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:05,500
was recreational first and then

1222
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:06,818
marijuana second yep a lot of people had

1223
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,050
to put in a lot of work to get it where

1224
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:10,358
it is and we're kind of [ __ ] those

1225
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,170
people now and it sucks I didn't even

1226
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,969
think about that

1227
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,829
yep that sucks yeah it's happening to

1228
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,459
people yeah you know what you guys

1229
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:19,230
should do

1230
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:22,000
Sunday's Mother's Day mom some weed I

1231
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,010
don't know I saw a post today it's

1232
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,659
graduation time in Boulder and I saw a

1233
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:29,500
post that said the dispensaries are

1234
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:31,449
busier today than they were during 4/20

1235
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:39,730
because all the moms and pops need to

1236
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:41,919
get some weed for going into that

1237
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,929
[ __ ] store okay you're getting me an

1238
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,858
eighth of the stickiest of the ickiest

1239
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:51,328
and you're driving home don't pinch my

1240
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:53,139

1241
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:54,310
all right I'll give you one more

1242
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:55,029
question if you got a good one on the

1243
00:51:54,309 --> 00:52:00,460
phone screen there

1244
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:06,280
um I know like like electricity bills

1245
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:08,858
for four growers like I know that not

1246
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,900
everybody is an outdoor grower we talked

1247
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:13,750
to some guys that last time we talked to

1248
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:17,260
a guy that was an outdoor grower I'm

1249
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,730
wondering you know per plant you know

1250
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,970
how many lights are you using or is it

1251
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,548
one light for foreplay

1252
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:23,929
you know I don't what's common I'm not

1253
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:27,500
trying to get into you got business

1254
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:29,118
example there's a huge it's kind of a

1255
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,659
personal preference how many lights per

1256
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,990
plant

1257
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:35,509
so most most larger grows will be a

1258
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:37,098
thousand watt light usually if you got a

1259
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,630
bedroom I've seen guys doing two in a

1260
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:39,710
bedroom some guys got four in a bedroom

1261
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,240
that's usually like your average

1262
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,068
residential grow no more than four

1263
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:45,739
lights or so in a house if you're doing

1264
00:52:43,068 --> 00:52:47,538
an industrial thing then you need what's

1265
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:48,828
called phase three electrical you're an

1266
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,750
industrial guy you know what I'm talking

1267
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:52,818
about it's I do we don't a little more

1268
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,519
power availability uh it's just going

1269
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:57,079
from like a hundred and twenty volts to

1270
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:59,150
two forty two forty two warning yeah

1271
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,180
because and it's instead of just being a

1272
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:04,849
single phase line power going in it's

1273
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:06,649
it's like three phases I it's a lot of

1274
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:08,599
jargon yeah yeah but it's able to

1275
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,170
harness a lot more power without being a

1276
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,329
fire hazard

1277
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,889
also that is that's the most

1278
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:17,359
intelligence since I've ever heard you

1279
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:19,429
know I was like man he is fluent in

1280
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,980
speech when it comes to some power you

1281
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,629
know what's it cuz I went to school for

1282
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,579
for electrical I was gonna do solar

1283
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:28,579
powered stuff I thought uh yeah well

1284
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:30,829
back when it was not ridiculously

1285
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:33,710
expensive before Vestas came in like

1286
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:35,960
this is a while ago before all the solar

1287
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,000
power stuff was going on I thought this

1288
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,490
is the field I want to get into so I

1289
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,409
went to school for like electronics and

1290
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:44,239
stuff so I actually have like a minor

1291
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:45,798
like understanding of what's going on

1292
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,308
with that stuff I'm not saying I know a

1293
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:51,500
whole lot but but as soon as

1294
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:55,490
unfortunately like the the prices of

1295
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,710
like solar panels and like wind turbines

1296
00:53:55,489 --> 00:54:00,288
and stuff like that just skyrocketed

1297
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:03,490
windmills and stuff it's it's far too

1298
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:06,740
expensive to get in and and have a

1299
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:10,068
profit or save any money within the next

1300
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:12,500
10 years so I'm sure it sucks but that's

1301
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:15,650
that's something that you know I wish

1302
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,289
that there was a cheaper alternative to

1303
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:21,108
those things that would be like I carry

1304
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:23,720
around a book solar energy for dummies

1305
00:54:21,108 --> 00:54:26,210
oh no [ __ ] oh yeah it's in my backpack

1306
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:29,149
like it's it's always on me because III

1307
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,858
think that's an amazing industry oh yeah

1308
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,349
I wish that it was more prevalent

1309
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:36,708
because [ __ ] you Black Hills yes

1310
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:38,359
we had a dispensary downtown no we were

1311
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:40,129
the only dispensary downtown for a while

1312
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,978
and they shut us down but we were

1313
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,358
running quite a few lights in there

1314
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,858
there were easily 20 grow lights in

1315
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,150
there and that I'm gonna get back to

1316
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:48,828
what your question was there's easily

1317
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,719
there were easily 20 grow lights in

1318
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:52,068
there plus a more veg light area and

1319
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,440
then another downstairs area and then

1320
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:56,239
plus the dispensary business area we had

1321
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,838
so much solar on the building on the

1322
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:01,068
roof that we were our bill was negative

1323
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,239
we're getting money back from the

1324
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:06,858
company but you got to be a dispensary

1325
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:08,119
to have that type of funding you know it

1326
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:10,009
was that building was actually a health

1327
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:11,509
food store before our dispensary took it

1328
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:13,728
over so they had a lot to they started

1329
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:15,949
it and we finished funding it but if

1330
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:17,419
you're running a residential grow what I

1331
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:19,699
have seen from like a caregiver girl

1332
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,519
you're gonna average about $100 per

1333
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:23,930
thousand watt light per month on your

1334
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:25,998
electric bill because you need the light

1335
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:27,889
is gonna run you so much you need a

1336
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:29,179
couple of fans you need a blower you're

1337
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:30,528
gonna have a couple more accessories

1338
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:32,629
that go with that that I'll need to plug

1339
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:34,219
in a timer for this and that you're

1340
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,769
gonna be running some about a hundred

1341
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,778
dollars per light through a veg cycle

1342
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:42,108
hundred dollars a month per month per

1343
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:43,639
light yeah well but from one light if

1344
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:45,318
you do it right you're gonna get a pound

1345
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,969
of weed if you do it correctly there's

1346
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:54,708
one pound of weed and depending where

1347
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:57,349
you are I don't even want to talk it's

1348
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:59,389
me about three thousand thirty two and

1349
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:00,739
you're actually you're you're talking

1350
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,018
[ __ ] about just about the right numbers

1351
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:04,699
nice yeah anywhere from 25 to 35

1352
00:56:03,018 --> 00:56:06,048
depending on who you are what you grew

1353
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,489
what you've got that's about what a

1354
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:09,288
pound is gonna get you so that hundred

1355
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,059
dollars of electricity if you do it

1356
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:12,559
right hopefully you spent about a

1357
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:14,028
hundred dollars in nutrients like

1358
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,039
another hundred on supplies maybe one

1359
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:17,509
hundred on dirt I just maybe two hundred

1360
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,400
under I'm just guessing off the top of

1361
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:21,108
my head now yeah but you're hopefully

1362
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,849
you can are able to make that an

1363
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:24,739
investment hopefully you're able to give

1364
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:26,329
a portion to your patients that your

1365
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:27,889
caregiver for and take a portion for

1366
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:29,869
yourself to make some hash out of and

1367
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:31,159
then maybe move enough of it to your

1368
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:32,778
patients when they run out of their

1369
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,159
initial gift they got to pay for the

1370
00:56:32,778 --> 00:56:35,568
rest and that covers the light bill yeah

1371
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,298
hopefully you can work it out that way

1372
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:41,119
once you go protein grow pound a half

1373
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:42,469
two pounds per light but you just got to

1374
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,150
get good and have the right genetics it

1375
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:45,450
takes a while that takes a minute the

1376
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,740
right nutrients

1377
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:51,389
that's why we're talking on the genetics

1378
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:53,669
guy yeah yeah no heart of gold harvests

1379
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:55,469
heavy lemon Jeffrey harvest like a champ

1380
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:59,220
if you're looking for heavy harvesting

1381
00:56:55,469 --> 00:57:00,480
heavy weight crops yeah we're almost in

1382
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,219
an hour I'm gonna kind of in the

1383
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,059
questions and we're gonna do a couple

1384
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:07,439
more little quick things I remembered

1385
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:08,639
dude thanks for asking those good

1386
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,230

genetics Colorado calm if you go I read

1397
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:35,309
genetics Colorado calm slash forum I

1398
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,750
wrote this ten months and two weeks ago

1399
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:39,750
is what I believe it said I got a scroll

1400
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,130
up ten months and two days ago and my

1401
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,659
point is that it's still relevant here's

1402
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,599
a little bit of advice that I decided to

1403
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:47,250
rant a while back that says I'm asked

1404
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,720
tons of questions about grande ganja my

1405
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,670
first piece of advice is to buy yourself

1406
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,230
a good cannabis grow guide I recommend

1407
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:54,300
something from ed Rosenthal Jorge

1408
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:55,889
Cervantes or Greg Greene the good grow

1409
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,420
grow guide will answer most of your

1410
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,190
questions before they arise and you will

1411
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,318
if you take the time to read the book

1412
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:02,490
before you start growing you can't just

1413
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:04,050
buy the book and set it by the [ __ ]

1414
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:05,669
you got to open it up and read it that's

1415
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:07,829
I didn't type that but that's how I feel

1416
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,450
yeah you gotta open it and read that

1417
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:11,010
thing from cover to cover before you

1418
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:12,750
even get your seeds all right now on to

1419
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,910
the reading one of my other biggest

1420
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,650
pieces of advice I can ever share would

1421
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,460
be to think twice before you do anything

1422
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,720
new in your garden

1423
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,280
if you have a bright idea to try

1424
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,108
something new that you heard from a

1425
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,609
friend or read online take the time to

1426
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:25,679
think it through before you attempt it

1427
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:27,659
anyone can post on the internet and

1428
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,519
claim to have heavy or have stellar

1429
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,348
results some of those results will not

1430
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,940
only will only work in specific

1431
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,710
situations and will often lead to

1432
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,280
additional problems down the line in

1433
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,750
your garden

1434
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,730
I'm not discouraging you from

1435
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:41,068
experimenting in your garden I strongly

1436
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,409
encourage experimentation and expanding

1437
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:45,449
your skills I'm encouraging responsible

1438
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:47,368
experimentation you won't learn anything

1439
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:48,989
new unless you try new things don't be

1440
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:50,550
afraid to kill a plant or two but don't

1441
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:52,169
get reckless and kill an entire crop

1442
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:54,630
trying an idea you heard at the hydro

1443
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,920
shop the next time you get an idea in

1444
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,079
your garden you should think about a few

1445
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,068
things what is your goal what's the

1446
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,930
point of what your attempt

1447
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,068
seriously and clearly think about what

1448
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:04,469
you're trying to make happen

1449
00:59:02,068 --> 00:59:06,239
cannabis grows stop making it more

1450
00:59:04,469 --> 00:59:07,588
difficult than it needs to be that's

1451
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,298
like something I always tell my friends

1452
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:12,659
that are grown weed may have problems

1453
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:14,728
stop making it more difficult than it

1454
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:16,379
grows in Afghanistan on the side of a

1455
00:59:14,728 --> 00:59:17,698
cliff he asked mountain in the wind and

1456
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,459
the rain and the Sun and it's getting

1457
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:22,199
beat to [ __ ] animals piss in it let it

1458
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,548
grow dude it's gonna be you should be

1459
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,680
cool it's a weed

1460
00:59:23,548 --> 00:59:27,748
it is good weed if you do it right so

1461
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,308
now on to my reading where did you get

1462
00:59:27,748 --> 00:59:31,259
this idea is the idea from a reputable

1463
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:32,609
source or is it a troll online who's

1464
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:34,469
never grown a plant but thinks he knows

1465
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:36,328
everything keep in mind that most of the

1466
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:38,759
things you do won't show results for two

1467
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:40,798
to five days you can spray or feed some

1468
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:42,539
ridiculous [ __ ] today and think

1469
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,219
everything is cool and then in a few

1470
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,079
days boom everything is brown and pissed

1471
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:47,338
off scissoring and pruning are not

1472
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,109
fixable if you chop off something

1473
00:59:47,338 --> 00:59:51,298
important be mindful of what you're

1474
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:53,278
making happen every action has an equal

1475
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:55,528
and opposite reaction plants seem to

1476
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:58,170
remind this remind us of this when we

1477
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:59,309
try to get silly in the garden if you

1478
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:01,259
decide to try something new

1479
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,849
don't try it out on your whole crop test

1480
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:04,349
an idea on a plant you have grown a few

1481
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,880
times and you know exactly what to

1482
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:07,769
expect under your normal conditions I

1483
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,479
just got all nasally in my headphones if

1484
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:11,129
you like what you see you can do your

1485
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:13,348
new trick to the entire crop next time

1486
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,849
if you do things correctly you'll be

1487
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,619
running another crop in a few weeks and

1488
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:18,930
you can try new stuff again don't try

1489
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:21,239
everything new all at once you can make

1490
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:22,440
five changes and something works how

1491
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:24,289
will you know what made the buds grow

1492
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,208
like that try to make changes slowly

1493
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:28,769
right if I if I tune all five things how

1494
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:31,228
do I know which one made that bud get

1495
01:00:28,768 --> 01:00:32,488
really huge yeah exactly so once you've

1496
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,899
thought about your idea twice and

1497
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:35,699
considered the long-term effects go

1498
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,809
smoke a fat joint and reconsider your

1499
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,130
idea

1500
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,539
read a cannabis grow guide from a

1501
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:42,059
reputable author and see what they say

1502
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:44,339
about your idea if you post your idea

1503
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,809
online expect varied replies and please

1504
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:47,728
don't take anyone too seriously

1505
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:49,589
after you've thought about the methods

1506
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:51,689
and results of your idea twice read a

1507
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:54,150
Grove read a grow guide smoke the joint

1508
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,499
and reconsider it every detail take very

1509
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,838
good notes of what you do and follow

1510
01:00:55,498 --> 01:01:00,028
your heart to reach your goals take good

1511
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,588
notes good notes because that's how we

1512
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:04,108
know what we did what worked what didn't

1513
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:06,358
work take good notes mmm so my point

1514
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:09,028
here this is still I wrote this months

1515
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:09,958
ago and this is still valid just think

1516
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:11,068
about what you're doing because you're

1517
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,239
gonna go in there you're gonna be like I

1518
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:14,250
want to try this

1519
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,629
rhasta Jeff said to do this online maybe

1520

I'm growing a heavy indica and your

1521
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,869
plants this ateva and you're gonna try

1522
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,550
that and it's just gonna put the kibosh

1523
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:21,569
right on your whole crop and now you and

1524
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,950
your patients are gonna be out of weed

1525
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:25,230
but I want you to get in there to try

1526

1528
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:30,599
reckless but yeah that's when we're

01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,039
talking about learning new stuff that

1530
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,119
was my favorite piece of advice that I

1531
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:35,250

1567
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:59,969
just gonna steal the pictures off of

1568
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:02,519
websites and just use those high quality

1569
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:03,899
shots instead of taking a photo but

1570
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:05,699
that's gonna lead me into a section

1571
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,050

1574
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:13,230
to the cannabis movement of course I'm

1575
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:15,000
talking about mr. ed Rosenthal the

1576
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:17,159

1579
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:25,590

1580
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,950
of cannabis he was there when having a

1581
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,358
joint

1582
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:28,949
was a serious crime and now he's here

1583
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:30,690

1599
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:02,670
not recognize authority of states to

1600
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,170
regulate the use of medical marijuana he

1601

1603
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:11,519
Rosenthal was subsequently convicted

1604
01:04:09,088 --> 01:04:13,338
again but was not be sentenced since his

1605
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,289
original sentence had been completed

1606
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:19,639

1609
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,800
promoting and developing policies in

1610
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,510
civil regulation for medical marijuana

1611
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:30,329
with the passage of California's

1612
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:32,910
pioneering proposition 215 in 1996 which

1613
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:34,260
authorizes medicinal use of marijuana he

1614
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:36,480
worked with the state and local

1615
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,980
governments to implement the delivery of

1616
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,000
pharmaceutical grade cannabis to

1617

the cultivation of marijuana he wrote

1621
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,980

01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,419
little girl lesson from my buddy Jesse

1749
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:43,250
and we're also hanging out with my hash

1750
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:45,350
buddy Kevin how are you doing today bro

1751
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,550
doing pretty good man you doing good

1752
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,679
doing good no you got this recording

1753
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,440
figured out yeah it's been a it's been a

1754
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:52,908
little difficult this evening but

1755
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:54,529
technology does that sometimes I guess

1756
01:10:52,908 --> 01:10:58,488
I'm not sure it's the technology's fault

1757
01:10:54,529 --> 01:11:01,869
it might be the tabs the dabs and the

1758
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:04,609
phase-two rig and the torch combination

1759
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:06,229
I'm gonna blame it on technology because

1760
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:09,259
everyone has a lot of problems with

1761
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:11,408
technology all the time so it's common

1762
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:13,880
but the good things are not so rare

1763
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:16,759

actually the taping of Doug loves movies

1811
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:06,529
which is probably my favorite podcast

1812
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:08,630
that's a toss-up there are a couple that

1813
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,829
could qualify but yeah so I got to go

1814
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:12,199
see the taping of one of my favorite

1815
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:13,970
podcast and then once again uh a lot of

1816
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:15,559
people really uh they didn't think he

1817
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:17,210
was gonna come out they were really I

1818
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,650
can't think of the word they didn't

1819
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:20,239
believe they were not believers that he

1820
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:23,839
was gonna show up and come out and smoke

1821
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:25,309
with us they were skeptics and he came

1822
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,539
out and he puffed a big fat joint it was

1823

1845
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:13,130
weird in the news today Minnesota passes

1846
01:14:10,908 --> 01:14:14,719

1849
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:21,168
then we'll talk about it for a second

1850
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:22,759
here okay though qualifying Minnesota

1851
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:24,859
medical marijuana patients will only

1852
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,689
have the option of vaporizing and eating

1853
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:29,658
concentrated forms of marijuana illness

1854
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:31,519
they'll have access less than two months

1855
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:33,319
ago Medical Marijuana seemed dead at

1856
01:14:31,519 --> 01:14:34,998
least as far as legislative session was

1857
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:37,279
concerned but during a press conference

1858
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:39,498
this afternoon Scott Dibble and Carly

1859
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:41,688
melon announced that Senate and House

1860
01:14:39,498 --> 01:14:43,998
have come together on a medical

1861
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:45,860
marijuana compromise Dibble said the

1862
01:14:43,998 --> 01:14:47,719
compromise bill is based on the more

1863
01:14:45,859 --> 01:14:49,668
restrictive house model there will be

1864
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:52,458
eight so-called alternative care centers

1865
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:53,689
around the state qualifying conditions

1866
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:56,658
for a medical cannabis prescription

1867
01:14:53,689 --> 01:15:00,229
include cancer terminal illness glaucoma

1868
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:01,819
hiv/aids and Crohn's disease PTSD isn't

1869
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,769
included in the qualifying condition

1870
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:05,899
Dibble indicated he isn't happy about

1871
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:08,208
that but said it's a compromise it's not

1872
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:10,009
a perfect process patients won't be able

1873
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:12,078
to smoke or vaporize loose-leaf

1874
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:14,958
marijuana but will have access to whole

1875
01:15:12,078 --> 01:15:17,149
plant extracts as Dibble put it rap Dan

1876
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,859
Shoen characterized the bill as the

1877
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:21,938
strictest and most regulated in the

1878
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:24,649
country as far as medical marijuana goes

1879
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:26,479
Governor Mark Dayton announced he'll

1880
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:29,078
sign the bill into law even before this

1881
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:31,130
afternoon's press conference even began

1882
01:15:29,078 --> 01:15:34,518
he announced that he would before the

1883
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:35,958
conference began there's a lot of I

1884
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:37,539
should have stopped on a lot of things

1885
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:40,819
here

1886
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:42,679
loose leaf cannabis made me chuckle we

1887
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,759
call that flowers that's weed that's

1888
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:46,189
cannabis buds

1889
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,969
yeah that's notable cannabis that's what

1890
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:50,869
it is marijuana they're gonna be

1891
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:53,090
alternative care centers around the

1892
01:15:50,868 --> 01:15:56,738
state and I think what you

1893
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:58,760
gonna be able to do is medicate their I

1894
01:15:56,738 --> 01:16:00,408
don't think they're because they're not

1895
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,719
gonna give me any flowers it doesn't

1896
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:04,670
sound like does it concentrate so I

1897
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,429
think they'll probably sell concentrates

1898
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:10,429
but does that mean because isn't dabbing

1899
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:15,199
vaporizing kinda is so that's how you

1900
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:17,719
smoke oils is you vaporize them and

1901
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:19,339
another stupid thing PTSD isn't included

1902
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,260
as a qualifying yeah that's that's

1903
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:23,329
freaking [ __ ] yeah because the first

1904
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,920
of all there's evidence I guess it you

1905
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,779
can't prove if it's helping your PTSD

1906
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,500
really you can't maybe you can if you're

1907
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:32,420
a psychologist I but I have paid I have

1908
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:36,289
patients that come into my shop that are

1909
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:40,130
former military veterans and stuff and

1910
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:42,319
they man does it help them in their

1911
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:45,109
quality of life yeah and their families

1912
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:47,118
quality of life because of what the PTSD

1913
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:48,408
does and the other option is what they

1914
01:16:47,118 --> 01:16:51,979
do if they don't have cannabis as they

1915
01:16:48,408 --> 01:16:55,429
drink alcohol yeah I've actually had one

1916
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:57,678
patient that I cured with cannabis from

1917
01:16:55,429 --> 01:17:00,789
an alcohol addiction for many many years

1918
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:03,529
and he hasn't he keeps coming back and

1919
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:05,000
hasn't used alcohol since he came in the

1920
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:06,920
first time the first time he came in he

1921
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,130
didn't know anything about marijuana B

1922
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:13,969
so yeah definitely so something that

1923
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:17,719
really is weird here there whoever who

1924
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:19,698
pushed this bill who set this up to get

1925
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:24,319
past this way this is a failure in my

1926
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:26,329
opinion he says it's a compromise it's

1927
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:28,368
not a perfect process dude you just

1928
01:17:26,329 --> 01:17:30,618
signed up for [ __ ] that kind of

1929
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:32,960
cock-blocked any of the stuff that would

1930
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:37,039
have been useful I'm not saying that

1931
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:40,158
edibles and capsules and concentrates

1932
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:41,658
are not the way to go but the main the

1933
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,269
way we discover the effectiveness of

1934
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:46,158
cannabis the best way to consume the

1935
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:48,380
natural way the real way is to just

1936
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:51,969
smoke raw all right that's what's been

1937
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:56,569
done for thousands of years yeah and and

1938
01:17:51,969 --> 01:17:59,270
we need that to make anything else yeah

1939
01:17:56,569 --> 01:18:01,639
we need that quality flour and that

1940
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:05,540
research and that that's everything

1941
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:07,270
still being done on on the plant because

1942
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:10,930
we need that

1943
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:14,690
to its full potential to be able to make

1944
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,980
the concentrated medicine right so I

1945
01:18:14,689 --> 01:18:17,419
wonder how I wondered who's gonna be

1946
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:18,909
making the concentrates for these guys

1947
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:22,130
mmm

1948
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:28,849
the strictest regulations in the medical

1949
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:31,430
marijuana game that's yeah we'll see um

1950
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:33,170
we'll see what comes out of there yeah

1951
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:35,180
what if you guys are in states that are

1952
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:37,640
proposing medical marijuana regulations

1953
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,760
don't settle for stuff like that you can

1954
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,500
you can language your bills your

1955
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,900
proposed bills can be language din the

1956
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,329
way that worked for you yeah be smart

1957
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:50,809
about it and make sure that you are able

1958
01:18:47,329 --> 01:18:52,460
to consume raw loose-leaf material and

1959
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,650
flour definitely that's available make

1960
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,090
sure you enable yourself to grow make

1961
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:57,710
sure that each person is allowed to grow

1962
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:59,150
cannabis when you're if you're the

1963
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,710
persons that are involved in writing

1964
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:02,599
these bills and proposing this if that's

1965
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:03,350
your responsibility make sure you're

1966
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,380
able to grow

1967
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:09,950
make sure there's access and please stop

1968
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:12,109
the CBD only treatment yes please I've

1969
01:19:09,949 --> 01:19:13,159
ranted about that for food if you're one

1970
01:19:12,109 --> 01:19:15,109
of the people that's helped I keep

1971
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:16,519
telling all kinds of people that come in

1972
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:19,579
from other states that they're talking

1973
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,200
about the CBD only stuff that's going on

1974
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:24,019
wherever they're from or whatever I'd

1975
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,970
let them know that that's not not the

1976
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,940
way to go we need this whole plant it's

1977
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:32,960
not one specific chemical that does this

1978
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:34,729
thing it's the combination of of what's

1979
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,949
in the plan and sometimes CBD is the way

1980
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:40,339
to go for some folks but men I believe

1981
01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:40,939
higher CBD not just see yeah yeah it's

1982
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,430
the entourage

1983
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:45,500
it needs the mix of everything else to

1984
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:46,970
work correctly Sanjay Gupta I think is

1985
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,470
who were coined the phrase the entourage

1986
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,789
effect I'm not sure if that was him but

1987
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:53,750
that's all the cannabinoids working

1988
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:55,010
together yes so yeah I'm gonna move on

1989
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:57,529
cuz we could go about that one all day

1990
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:59,000
if this is kind of an old piece of news

1991
01:19:57,529 --> 01:20:00,590
here oh it's actually from today state

1992
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,689
approved marijuana testing labs in

1993
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:06,890
Colorado can't accept private pot

1994
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:08,869
samples yep luckily I am part of a

1995
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,100
facility where I'm able to get my stuff

1996
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,239
tested so it helps me search for

1997
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,640
phenotypes

1998
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:16,939
it helps me decide what I need for each

1999
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,890
patient unfortunately the average

2000
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:20,448
citizen cannot go and get his stuff

2001
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,070
tested I'll read it to you

2002
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:24,228
Colorado medical and retail marijuana

2003
01:20:22,069 --> 01:20:25,670
testing labs license by the marijuana

2004
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:27,619
Enforcement Division can no longer

2005
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:29,809
accept and test private samples dropped

2006
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:31,248
off by patients and caregivers legally

2007
01:20:29,809 --> 01:20:33,610
they're only allowed to test marijuana

2008
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:35,569
from state licensed marijuana facilities

2009
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:37,158
for new listeners the marijuana

2010
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:39,049
Enforcement Division is the group we

2011
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:41,569
talk about all the time they are in

2012
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,650
charge of they're exactly what they

2013
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:43,939
sound like the Enforcement Division

2014
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:46,429
they're able to show up at your

2015
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:48,339
dispensary and inspect everything they

2016
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:50,690
are attached to the IRS they are

2017
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,309
seriously involved with all of the

2018
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:54,348
medical marijuana the recreational

2019
01:20:52,309 --> 01:20:56,659
marijuana business they are heavily

2020
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:58,670
regulating all of it so officials say

2021
01:20:56,658 --> 01:21:00,109
the move keeps the state out of the

2022
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:01,639
federal government's crosshairs by

2023
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:03,439
maintaining a tight lock on marijuana

2024
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:05,239
inventory but it also punishes home

2025
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,348
growing patients who want to know what

2026
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:08,359
they are putting in their bodies and

2027
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:09,619
prevents objective third-party tests

2028
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:12,139
from being conducted on products

2029
01:21:09,618 --> 01:21:14,929
currently for sale so what they're

2030
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:17,538
saying is I'm a caregiver and Kevin's my

2031
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:19,399
patient I've got another patient that

2032
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:21,439
would really like some super high CBD

2033
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:22,759
medicine and I have one strain that I

2034
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:24,078
work with it's really super high I've

2035
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,489
got another one coming up and just

2036
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:30,799
finding the keeper if Kevin if I weren't

2037
01:21:28,488 --> 01:21:32,178
growing with the dispensary or involved

2038
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,920
with dispensaries and had those shops

2039
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:35,420
growing my products growing my seed

2040
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,309
packs I wouldn't be able to get these

2041
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:39,828
things tested ah

2042
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:42,170
if Kevin were his own caregiver he

2043
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,849
wouldn't be able to take his medicine to

2044
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:45,800
the to these places and have it tested

2045
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:47,328
to find the high CBD strain that he

2046
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,729
needs or the high THC strain that he

2047
01:21:47,328 --> 01:21:51,679
needs and that's who it should be all

2048
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:53,650
about is the patient so they're kind of

2049
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,729
screwing the caregiver over on this one

2050
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:58,819
essentially you just got to grow a bunch

2051
01:21:55,729 --> 01:22:01,039
of weed and smoke it and find what works

2052
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:03,170
for you and that's what works instead of

2053
01:22:01,038 --> 01:22:05,328
being able to just you know take a nut

2054
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,849
off of each of your plant and take a

2055
01:22:05,328 --> 01:22:10,130
gram and go have each one tested and

2056
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:12,319
know what's going to work for you and

2057
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:15,670
another thing that we can't do we can't

2058
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:18,170
test for molds or pesticides or

2059
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:21,739
pathogens or any type of heavy metals or

2060
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:23,300
contaminants I I have faith in my

2061
01:22:21,738 --> 01:22:24,558
growing but wouldn't you like to know

2062
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,119
once in a while I mean that's how you

2063
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:28,309
know if you're even right just take a

2064
01:22:26,118 --> 01:22:29,688
sample to the lab and luckily I can do

2065
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:31,610
it I just got a bunch of stuff tested

2066
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:32,780
and I hate to brag but I hit pretty

2067
01:22:31,609 --> 01:22:33,829
freakin awesome numbers and zero

2068
01:22:32,779 --> 01:22:35,689
contaminate

2069
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:36,920
pathogens problems pesticides it was all

2070
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:39,039
clean

2071
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,470
luckily I'm hooked up like that

2072
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:44,479
according to the meed the rule hasn't

2073
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:46,880
been in effect since October 15th of

2074
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,529
2013 but it wasn't being followed at

2075
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,480
least not so strictly that the Denver

2076
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:51,829
Post wasn't able to get independent test

2077
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,139
done on edibles as recently as March

2078
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:57,710
through steep hill Halen and Hemi

2079
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:59,450
devised ins lab do our officials that's

2080
01:22:57,710 --> 01:23:01,039
Department of Revenue officials haven't

2081
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:02,630
admitted that those tests which showed

2082
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:03,529
an embarrassing lack of oversight on

2083
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:05,300
behalf of the meed

2084
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:07,009
spurred the sudden enforcement of the

2085
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,199
rule and announcement of the change but

2086
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,210
the timing is curious and brings up

2087
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:13,460
another point westward and the post as

2088
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:15,260
well as many other as any other media

2089
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:17,420
outlet will no longer be able to do our

2090
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:20,869
own independent tests at state verified

2091
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,960
marijuana labs so I'm gonna recap a

2092
01:23:20,869 --> 01:23:25,579
couple of episodes ago we talked about

2093
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,680
the westward bought edibles from

2094
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:29,090
dispensaries and took them to labs to be

2095
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:31,550
tested and we found out that there's

2096
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,569
some [ __ ] going on there and now

2097
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:36,050
with these new rules

2098
01:23:32,569 --> 01:23:38,299
maybe those tests reminded the

2099
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:40,279
regulators that this rule is in place

2100
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,750
and we shouldn't they forgot nobody's

2101
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:43,039
enforcing its we think we kind of got

2102
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,350
their attention by maybe putting it in

2103
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:47,359
the paper but then also now we can't do

2104
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:49,070
that anymore a normal guy like you and I

2105
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,809
if we get an edible and we're like this

2106
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:52,369
one's crap and we save half of it we

2107
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:55,130
can't take it down to the testing lab

2108
01:23:52,369 --> 01:23:56,119
and say test this for me so we've kind

2109
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,699
of been blocked out which I don't think

2110
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:00,680
is cool I don't think it's cool so

2111
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:03,050
that's another thing if you uh if you're

2112
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,030
setting up legalization in your state

2113
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:08,810
make sure that the testing is available

2114
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:10,639
for anybody not just state licensed

2115
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:12,320
facilities because not everybody can

2116
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,789
afford the state licensing not everybody

2117
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:15,409
needs to be state licensed as long as

2118
01:24:13,789 --> 01:24:17,350
you're a caregiver I think you should

2119
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:21,769
have the right to get your stuff tested

2120
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:23,810
agree I agree with myself I'm gonna see

2121
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:25,100
if I got another news topic in here read

2122
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:28,280
one more news topic and then we'll get

2123
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:29,630
into my good buddy Jesse came over a

2124
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:33,349
little earlier and we recorded some

2125
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:35,029
stuff about outdoor growing so this may

2126
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:36,440
be a little bit old to some of you I

2127
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:38,090
wanted to talk about it on the show but

2128
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:40,069
we've been so busy that had a lot of

2129
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:41,750
news going on and this week there ain't

2130
01:24:40,069 --> 01:24:43,609
[ __ ] in the weed news I'm sorry for that

2131
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:46,310
kind of good things that let us get the

2132
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:50,210
grow episode anyway

2133
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:53,590
House bill 1361 which limits hash hash

2134
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:55,819
sales and House bill 1366 which further

2135
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:58,760
regulate edible sales were approved by

2136
01:24:55,819 --> 01:25:01,159
the state Senate on third on the third

2137
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,780
reading yesterday and now I head to the

2138
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:04,460
governor's desk for signing and then

2139
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:05,599
there is an update oh that's the update

2140
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,789
the original post

2141
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,230
I read that kind of backwards I'll tell

2142
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:10,969
you what they're what they're signing a

2143
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:13,879
bill limiting how much marijuana

2144
01:25:10,969 --> 01:25:15,800
concentrate can be sold in state and out

2145
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,199
to in-state and out-of-state residents

2146
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:20,119
who are age 21 and older as well as

2147
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:22,099
legislation placing new rules on

2148
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:24,439
marijuana edibles appear on track to

2149
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:27,440
become state law as lawmakers try to

2150
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:29,539
wrap up a 2014 session loaded with weed

2151
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:30,649
bills by Wednesday afternoon damn that

2152
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:32,269
was a mouthful of words I'm gonna take a

2153
01:25:30,649 --> 01:25:34,429
drink of some coconut water here give me

2154
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:37,460
one second quick second taking a drink

2155
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:42,800
here we go shout out to coconut water by

2156
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:45,560
the way you know if you buy the coconut

2157
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,329
water do not get one with lemon in it

2158
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,320
there are a lot of tasty flavors mango

2159
01:25:47,329 --> 01:25:50,059
there's pineapple

2160
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:52,549
there's citrusy ones don't get the one

2161
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:53,480
with the lemon I had to try it once okay

2162
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:56,750
oh dude

2163
01:25:53,479 --> 01:25:58,789
I don't really know what that's about

2164
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:01,520
but that's good for you dude it's good

2165
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:03,439
for you Oh tastiness that water from the

2166
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,910
coconut its water from the coconut it's

2167
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:07,189
pretty much the package says it's like

2168
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:09,738
sticking a straw in a coconut and I

2169
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:10,789
think it's accurate okay yeah get the

2170
01:26:09,738 --> 01:26:12,289
ones with some fruit juice in it if

2171
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:13,729
you're new the it'll it'll kind of be

2172
01:26:12,289 --> 01:26:16,159
different the first time you try it you

2173
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:17,929
won't be ready for that alright that's a

2174
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:20,719
big plug for coconut water for the word

2175
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:21,890
alright House bill 1361 would charged

2176
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,359
the Department of Revenue with

2177
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,430
establishing how much hash or

2178
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:27,409
concentrates equal to an ounce of

2179
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,000
marijuana the measure has already been

2180
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:30,500
Greenland by the State House and it

2181
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,359
passed on a second reading in the state

2182
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:35,090
Senate yesterday without any amendments

2183
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:37,460
as a result the bill could have its

2184
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:38,719
third reading as early as today as we

2185
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:41,029
pointed out last month the bill's

2186
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,859
wording doesn't seem to make it clear

2187
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,689
whether the DOR is meant to measure the

2188
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:46,519
total THC in an ounce or the total

2189
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:49,039
amount of hash or concentrate that can

2190
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,960
be produced from an ounce neither does

2191
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,840
the legislation address the potency of

2192
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,300
the flowers to be tested whatever the

2193
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,199
final interpretation the net effect adds

2194
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,820
up to the same thing

2195
01:26:57,198 --> 01:26:59,658
consumers will no longer be able to walk

2196
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:02,179
out of a shop with

2197
01:26:59,658 --> 01:27:05,809
28 grams of hash far fewer than that

2198
01:27:02,179 --> 01:27:07,639
probably out-of-state consumers who are

2199
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:09,350
already limited to a quarter ounce of

2200
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:11,000
herb at a time will be limited to a

2201
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,789
quarter ounce of herbs equivalent in

2202
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
hash how are they gonna regulate that

2203
01:27:13,789 --> 01:27:18,649
bro because um about a gram

2204
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,850
they'll probably limit it to a gram you

2205
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:21,500
think that'll be it for out-of-state

2206
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:24,500
they'll probably say a gram for

2207
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:28,819
out-of-state and they'll probably do an

2208
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:32,000
eight for in-state maybe up to a quarter

2209
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:36,130
maybe not depends on what you know yeah

2210
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:39,439
because I may do five grams and this is

2211
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:40,730
it doesn't say they haven't decided they

2212
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:42,678
don't even know how to dissapoint yeah

2213
01:27:40,729 --> 01:27:46,158
how is a bill being passed when they

2214
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:48,319
don't have when they don't have it

2215
01:27:46,158 --> 01:27:50,269
written or the or the law it's likely

2216
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:51,889
it's not the next line says it's likely

2217
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,690
that the DOR will create a working group

2218
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:55,130
later this year to iron out details as

2219
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:57,169
the Department has done with marijuana

2220
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:58,130
centric legislation in the past so

2221
01:27:57,170 --> 01:28:01,699
they're gonna go about it backwards

2222
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:04,219
again yeah they're gonna play back so

2223
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:05,750
like every [ __ ] three months there's

2224
01:28:04,219 --> 01:28:08,079
gonna be new regulation and new

2225
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:11,029
regulation and everyone's gonna get

2226
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:14,689
audited and [ __ ] with just because

2227
01:28:11,029 --> 01:28:18,130
they can't figure out what dude you can

2228
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:22,698
get four good nugs you can get [ __ ]

2229
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:27,590
25% like average it to 20 off of a nug

2230
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:30,678
run put it on ten as a trim run [ __ ] you

2231
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:33,619
got seven grams that's about 0.7 if you

2232
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:36,560
got nug rin that's about 1.4 so you

2233
01:28:33,619 --> 01:28:38,929
average it out 1 1 gram have you ever

2234
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:42,080
have you ever seen anyone laters think

2235
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:46,219
like that no some of us in the community

2236
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:48,649
they try to listen to forget that try to

2237
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:51,889
listen to some people that for sure I

2238
01:28:48,649 --> 01:28:53,559
agree blue yeah if you want to limit it

2239
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:55,940
to the same thing as buying an ounce

2240
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:59,530
whatever that makes it concentrate but

2241
01:28:55,939 --> 01:29:01,819
can pick an average number and that's it

2242
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:03,229
pick one that's in the middle of the low

2243
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:07,238
end and the high end and go with that

2244
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:09,589
that's nice round number yeah I like it

2245
01:29:07,238 --> 01:29:11,629
they should just take they should make a

2246
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:13,110
tube it holds perfectly an ounce and

2247
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:15,029
just blast that in to contain

2248
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:19,289
and there you go that's your one out for

2249
01:29:15,029 --> 01:29:23,969
the country it's for sale little to go

2250
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:27,210
portion yeah so in a related measure

2251
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:29,850
House bill 1366 which would ban edible

2252
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:32,750
manufacturers manufacturers from making

2253
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:35,190
pot infused foods that and in quotes a

2254
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:38,069
reasonable consumer would confuse with

2255
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:40,019
the trademarked food product yeah so

2256
01:29:38,069 --> 01:29:42,988
that means that the reefers and the kif

2257
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:44,730
cat those are now banned in Colorado it

2258
01:29:42,988 --> 01:29:46,259
also looks like it will become law in

2259
01:29:44,729 --> 01:29:47,849
addition the bill prohibits edible

2260
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,010
makers from making pot foods that are

2261
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:51,300
primarily marketed to children and I'm

2262
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,590
sorry that I shouted out reefers and

2263
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,520
kiff cat but those were the obvious ones

2264
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:56,489
that I thought of I don't mean to point

2265
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,230
you but keep keep your recipe the same

2266
01:29:56,488 --> 01:30:04,678
and shape everything like a weed leaf

2267
01:29:58,229 --> 01:30:05,968
yep then it can't be confused require

2268
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:07,980
more stringent packaging and labeling

2269
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:09,539
from the marijuana industry the bills

2270
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:11,189
authors say the moves are needed to

2271
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:12,719
protect children while advocates have

2272
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:14,039
said the language is so vague that it

2273
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,529
might even prevent them from making

2274
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:18,329
marijuana cookies the state marijuana

2275
01:30:16,529 --> 01:30:20,340
Enforcement Division is also working on

2276
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:24,779
limiting the potency of edibles and is

2277
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:31,289
also discussing a labeling system it's

2278
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:33,988
still having a [ __ ] labeling can you

2279
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:36,539
change it again exactly yeah well

2280
01:30:33,988 --> 01:30:39,479
because they're due to change policy

2281
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:41,340
guidelines again well yeah but that's do

2282
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:47,669
you change the number on the [ __ ]

2283
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:50,520
potency that kind of relates to

2284
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:53,550
something we talked about how are we

2285
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,650
gonna measure the potency of these these

2286
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:57,630
edibles if the labs can't get their [ __ ]

2287
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:59,069
together and kind of agree on a standard

2288
01:30:57,630 --> 01:31:00,750
of how they're gonna test they all do

2289
01:30:59,069 --> 01:31:02,399
different tests if we took one lab or

2290
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,529
one candy bar to another lab and one to

2291
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:07,259
another it'll be different well that's

2292
01:31:04,529 --> 01:31:10,529
why not very many labs are licensed to

2293
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:14,039
do that right now very true very very

2294
01:31:10,529 --> 01:31:16,618
true why it's very limited and that's

2295
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:18,600
why there's back orders on [ __ ]

2296
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:20,609
products because there's like a couple

2297
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,230
of [ __ ] places to get tested at all

2298
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:26,188
these companies have to send all of

2299
01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:29,609
their stuff to get tested there

2300
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:31,499
and wait for the results and wait that's

2301
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:34,408
hundreds of companies in color I don't

2302
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:36,238
have to do that yeah yeah Wow I didn't

2303
01:31:34,408 --> 01:31:37,679
even think about many companies all

2304
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,328
right well I posted something on

2305
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,769

01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:41,339
[ __ ] people just trying to brag like

2332

2337
01:32:54,868 --> 01:32:58,618
before many people can even get their

2338
01:32:56,458 --> 01:33:00,658

2339

and there are no dispensaries in the

2340
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,988
state as of yet so even if you do have

2341
01:33:02,189 --> 01:33:06,110

2342

2347
01:33:16,168 --> 01:33:20,368

2400
01:35:34,378 --> 01:35:38,849
price the better the quality in that

2401
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:41,189
order bless oh it must mean like a grade

2402
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:43,779
10 plus

2403
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:46,268
people just have a hard time typing I

2404
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:47,469
think sometimes so I just wanted to

2405
01:35:46,269 --> 01:35:49,599
share with you what prices art of

2406
01:35:47,469 --> 01:35:52,210
cannabis across the nation right now in

2407
01:35:49,599 --> 01:35:54,960
Colorado there are eighths of top-notch

2408
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:57,038
superdate crystal e-tank homegrown nugs

2409
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,679
by homegrown I mean by a care giver

2410
01:35:57,038 --> 01:36:02,469
which loved his plants they were all

2411
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,480
organic nothing funky put in them you're

2412
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:06,399
looking about 25 and 8 if you know the

2413
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:10,149
guy if you're out of the loop maybe up

2414
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:11,649
to 35 ounces there are 200 bucks all day

2415
01:36:10,149 --> 01:36:14,589
long in Colorado you can find them for

2416
01:36:11,649 --> 01:36:16,689
150 I've seen them for 250 if you go to

2417
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:18,130
the shops you may he may feel a little

2418
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:20,138
dirty it's a little more expensive there

2419
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:21,400
he want to tell us what rec and medical

2420
01:36:20,139 --> 01:36:24,550
prices are bro since you're more

2421
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:29,679
informed well it depends on the shop but

2422
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:33,248
medical prices will go from 150 to 260

2423
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:35,440
I've seen it for an ounce just depends

2424
01:36:33,248 --> 01:36:37,929
on the shop and the weed and the weed

2425
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:42,460
but sometimes you can get good deals you

2426
01:36:37,929 --> 01:36:46,980
just never know but average is about 180

2427
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:49,118
200 okay for an ounce and then rec I

2428
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:52,238
haven't really haven't been any other

2429
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:53,889
wreck shop but mine so I couldn't say

2430
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,538
really do want to tell us what you

2431
01:36:53,889 --> 01:37:05,170
charge for now to recreationally to your

2432
01:36:55,538 --> 01:37:13,059
shop regular shelf is 395 I think in the

2433
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:19,059
before tax and then top shelf for the

2434
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:23,529
badass [ __ ] is 460 before tax you're

2435
01:37:19,059 --> 01:37:26,590
looking at about 460 after tax and 540

2436
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:28,448
after tax man banging on the quality a

2437
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:33,489
weed you want eighty bucks worth of tax

2438
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:37,448
on an ounce of weed and 17.4% so much

2439
01:37:33,488 --> 01:37:39,729
ouch ouch ouch $65 eight the cost you 76

2440
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:42,009
and change can I divide my ounce into

2441
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:44,498
four separate quarters it's gonna cost

2442
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:45,849
you quarter prices oh my god you're not

2443
01:37:44,498 --> 01:37:48,998
even gonna hook a brother up and give me

2444

2464
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:32,080
grow outdoor and he's like if we're

2465
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:35,020
gonna do it we got to do it soon because

2466
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:36,880
it's getting warms getting nice and I

2467

on dude thanks for coming to share some

2471
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:49,630
knowledge with us for sure

2472
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:53,319
I guess I should start how long have you

2473
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:56,949
been growing outdoors this will be my

2474
01:38:53,319 --> 01:39:00,309
seventh or eighth season so my earliest

2475
01:38:56,949 --> 01:39:04,389
memories I forgot I run around in a dope

2476
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:07,440
patch so nice yeah it's seven or eight

2477
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:09,910
years but on my own though so that's

2478
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,899
I've been around that's respectable yeah

2479
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:12,670
sounds like you know what you're doing

2480
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:13,839
yeah sounds like your parents are a

2481
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:28,329
bunch of damn hippies from the way you

2482
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:30,220
talk so your fondest earliest memories

2483
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:32,680
are running around in a dope patch yeah

2484
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:35,050
super fond memories the images that come

2485
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:39,900
through my head or just joyous yeah I

2486
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:39,900
wore overalls a lot as a child barefoot

2487
01:39:44,069 --> 01:39:49,420
yeah [ __ ]

2488
01:39:47,619 --> 01:39:51,828
yeah funny story used to think my dad

2489
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:57,559
was a skunk farmer

2490
01:39:51,828 --> 01:39:59,719
so a lot of people knew him yeah man and

2491
01:39:57,559 --> 01:40:01,639
then you know always in the fall he he

2492
01:39:59,719 --> 01:40:03,010
went hunting for skunks and that's why

2493
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:05,059
the freezer stunk

2494
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:06,710
yeah out there for a couple days

2495
01:40:05,059 --> 01:40:09,500
chopping down all the skunk's yeah

2496
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:11,090
awesome bastards

2497
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:13,069
yeah dude if you wanna if I wanted to

2498
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:15,319
start growing outdoors in Colorado or

2499
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:16,609
even in California or most of the warmer

2500
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:19,670
parts of the country now is the time

2501
01:40:16,609 --> 01:40:22,339
right oh yes holes dug and started

2502
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:25,460
getting clones out there yep if you're

2503
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:28,489
lucky you're well if you're not in

2504
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:30,489
Colorado you've started earlier so guys

2505
01:40:28,488 --> 01:40:37,669
in Cali are already in the ground ice

2506
01:40:30,488 --> 01:40:39,198
yeah we took some dad's earlier it'll

2507
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:40,429
take us a minute to get rolling get it

2508
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:46,519
started don't worry you can you put the

2509
01:40:40,429 --> 01:40:48,679
mic just a little closer yes yeah yeah

2510
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:51,679
so ideally you know if you're growing

2511
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:53,929
from seed you've wanted to start a long

2512
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:56,029
time ago especially if your girl from

2513
01:40:53,929 --> 01:40:59,090
regular seed so that you can all sex

2514
01:40:56,029 --> 01:41:00,769
them yes sex them even possibly you're

2515
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:03,409
growing a clone of the original seed

2516
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:06,159
plant outdoors that's kind of

2517
01:41:03,408 --> 01:41:08,738
complicated so trying to stay more basic

2518
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:12,399
feminized seeds are great for that

2519
01:41:08,738 --> 01:41:15,468
absolutely hence I read genetics I

2520
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:17,238
haven't done it yet but I suspect some

2521
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:19,670
heart of gold would kill outdoors here

2522
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:21,769
so yeah thanks for that yeah I would

2523
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:23,929
agree with that too someone's grown last

2524
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:29,900
year in Maryland I think oh well it was

2525
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:32,690
awesome yeah well done so clones you can

2526
01:41:29,899 --> 01:41:36,170
start a little little later you know

2527
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:43,339
ideally by this point you got about a 12

2528
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:48,590
to 18 foot little bush yeah no no no 18

2529
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:50,539
foot no so you get a 12 hopefully we've

2530
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:53,090
got a 12 inch to 18 inch little bush

2531
01:41:50,539 --> 01:41:55,908
yeah it's been topped Lots The Times

2532
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:57,170
okay guys well I'll make a note to talk

2533
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:58,339
about topping in the future because

2534
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:01,069
that's a whole another topic that I'll

2535
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:03,140
get into quickly that just it kind of

2536
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:06,679
divides the growth and makes

2537
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:10,640
one growing oh man I just got

2538
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:12,650
complicated basically you take the top

2539
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:14,030
shoot out of the plant the main top part

2540
01:42:12,649 --> 01:42:16,099
that you're gonna tell is gonna grow a

2541
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:17,569
big top cola and you cut that branch out

2542
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:19,820
and hopefully you just left a nice

2543
01:42:17,569 --> 01:42:23,630
y-shaped intersection with two tops now

2544
01:42:19,819 --> 01:42:25,460
and instead of one one giant cola you're

2545
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:26,930
gonna get two nice fat colas that are

2546
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:29,659
gonna hopefully weigh more than that one

2547
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:31,579
would have yeah that's the theory and if

2548
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:34,130
you learn to do it in the right spots at

2549
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:36,439
the right time you can create a [ __ ]

2550
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:38,930
dragon with 55 heads on it I know Joe

2551
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:40,489
and if you start early enough and that's

2552
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:43,730
when uh that's when the outdoor stuff

2553
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:46,279
gets good several times big big bushes

2554
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:48,919
bush Christmas trees the the stuff that

2555
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:50,719
everyone imagines yeah did you dream

2556
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,300
about it you see little you think a

2557
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:55,070
little elves should be at least as big

2558
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:58,930
around as your finger by now your middle

2559
01:42:55,069 --> 01:43:02,239
finger may be a little thicker yeah and

2560
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:05,659
you know actually we kind of had a cold

2561
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:10,760
snap here locally that might have kind

2562
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:13,309
of rained on a few people's parade but

2563
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:17,050
norm you know this is a little early but

2564
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:23,780
it's a safe time to go out from here too

2565
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:26,000
you know June 15th is completely safe

2566
01:43:23,779 --> 01:43:30,019
time today is May 15th we're recording

2567
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,329
just so that people have a reference one

2568
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:35,240
thing to speak on on that is if you have

2569
01:43:32,329 --> 01:43:37,909
your plants indoor say under 24-hour

2570
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:40,340
light cycle and they're rootbound

2571
01:43:37,909 --> 01:43:43,760
and you put them outside right now

2572
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:47,960
they're gonna bloom we only have about

2573
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:49,789
15 hours of light right now and a lot of

2574
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,539
sativa plants that's plenty enough to

2575
01:43:49,789 --> 01:43:55,789
trigger blooming coming from a

2576
01:43:52,539 --> 01:44:01,279
stressed-out 24 hour light cycle or 18

2577
01:43:55,789 --> 01:44:03,019
hour die cycle he's totally right yeah

2578
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,809
I'm sternly LaBrie but he's also taking

2579
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:06,890
a chunk from a dad yeah but uh he's only

2580
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:08,750
right if you're putting your plants that

2581
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:10,340
have been outdoors since jani are inside

2582
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,840
since January they're in pots they're

2583
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,920
starting to get Ruben bound cuz you're

2584
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,248
putting it off you're just waiting to

2585
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,170
put him outside here

2586
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:17,429
once you reduce that flowering time and

2587
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:19,139
they're already stressed enough they

2588
01:44:17,429 --> 01:44:20,868
will start to flower which is actually

2589
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:25,260
probably a good thing here in Colorado

2590
01:44:20,868 --> 01:44:28,109
yeah you're gonna because unfortunately

2591
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:32,729
in July it's gonna come out of flower

2592
01:44:28,109 --> 01:44:34,589
and let's go go back into veg and then

2593
01:44:32,729 --> 01:44:37,099
it won't go back into flour till August

2594
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:40,380
so that could really mess some stuff up

2595
01:44:37,099 --> 01:44:43,979
this is the time of year for windowsill

2596
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:46,199
plants normally growers have advised

2597
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:47,999
against window plants but this is the

2598
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:49,978
time of year to you know it's safe to

2599
01:44:47,998 --> 01:44:52,349
have that plant in the window getting

2600
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:54,929
used to the natural light cycle and

2601
01:44:52,349 --> 01:44:57,029
everything okay I'm kind of Milcah on

2602
01:44:54,929 --> 01:44:59,239
and off maybe have a little t5 above it

2603
01:44:57,029 --> 01:45:01,618
what if I mean house be ideal about now

2604
01:44:59,238 --> 01:45:04,228
yeah yeah I mean as long as it's not

2605
01:45:01,618 --> 01:45:08,488
stressed um you know nice fresh clone

2606
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:14,010
would be pretty safe in there and it's

2607
01:45:08,488 --> 01:45:16,888
gonna go ahead and start veg in so a

2608
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:19,110
little bit of high nitrogen feeding slow

2609
01:45:16,889 --> 01:45:23,368
down the bloom process to help prevent

2610
01:45:19,109 --> 01:45:24,839
that yes yes yes if you guys don't

2611
01:45:23,368 --> 01:45:26,009
overdo it but just uh when you put them

2612
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:27,029
out there feed a little extra nitrogen

2613
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:30,150
if you're doing it right now

2614
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:32,488
yeah and a lot of rude inoculations you

2615
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:36,149
know go wrong with a lot of inoculants

2616
01:45:32,488 --> 01:45:37,618
yeah and then you know larger containers

2617
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:41,578
is the best way to fix a root bound

2618
01:45:37,618 --> 01:45:43,738
plant so you were we were talking before

2619
01:45:41,578 --> 01:45:46,590
the show you said that the best way to

2620
01:45:43,738 --> 01:45:48,899
do it is always to throw that plant into

2621
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:51,078
the dirt get it into the earth that's

2622
01:45:48,899 --> 01:45:57,839
the best way to go firm believer in

2623
01:45:51,078 --> 01:46:01,170
attaching you know when it's man I gotta

2624
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:03,360
think of a good way to explain this I

2625
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:05,130
just I believe plants do better when

2626
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:07,618
they're attached to the earth and and

2627
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:10,288
they container full of peat moss not

2628
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:12,268
that that's a bad way to do it I just

2629
01:46:10,288 --> 01:46:13,639
think they're better in the earth well

2630
01:46:12,269 --> 01:46:17,940
that makes good sense

2631
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:20,640
our organics are really hard to mess up

2632
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:23,579
you know that's that's the easiest way

2633
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:27,090
to do organics and have stellar results

2634
01:46:23,579 --> 01:46:28,619
in my opinion could you say and this may

2635
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,969
be some you said the word hippie dippie

2636
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:33,599
[ __ ] earlier so maybe that's what this

2637
01:46:29,969 --> 01:46:37,710
is yes is it the vibration of the earth

2638
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:39,120
is it that connected yes okay I believe

2639
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:40,649
a lot in that sort of stuff in there

2640
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,630
growing I believe that that's part of

2641
01:46:40,649 --> 01:46:45,529
why our gross stand out because we agree

2642
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:48,930
that the plant is in the earth and us

2643
01:46:45,529 --> 01:46:51,119
symbiotic relationship and I learned a

2644
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:52,829
lot of that I had adopted this style

2645
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:55,019
before but then I learned a lot more of

2646
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:56,460
it from soma yeah if you guys are

2647
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:58,560
familiar with the old breed or soma if

2648
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:01,260
you're not do some reading on soma yes

2649
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,420
sir alright so we've gotten ourselves up

2650
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:06,659
to we're vegging outdoors we should

2651
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:08,760
rewind and talk about maybe having a

2652
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:10,800
secure garden and being having a legal

2653
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:13,260
garden that's up to you if you want to

2654
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:16,230
be legal in Colorado we advise you to be

2655
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:17,820
legal you can have six plants as a

2656
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:19,948
medical patient now you can have six

2657
01:47:17,819 --> 01:47:23,250
plants as a civilian over the age of 21

2658
01:47:19,948 --> 01:47:25,259
I do believe that half of those need to

2659
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:27,600
be in flower and half of those need to

2660
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,460
be in veg so you can put three large

2661
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,410
plants outside as long as they are not

2662
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:37,250
accessible or visible to the general

2663
01:47:31,409 --> 01:47:39,630
public and okay amendment 20 says it

2664
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:44,279
made mid-20s real open that's the

2665
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:49,380
medical bill it needs to be a secured

2666
01:47:44,279 --> 01:47:54,948
area basically as I've you know I can't

2667
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:58,529
recall per badum but whatever that is

2668
01:47:54,948 --> 01:48:02,309
but amendment 64 does mention some stuff

2669
01:47:58,529 --> 01:48:05,579
and it says a locked enclosed secured

2670
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:08,430
facility okay so depending on you know

2671
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:09,869
to me that says dog kennel yeah

2672
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:13,289
something just like this zone I was

2673
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:15,510
thinking - yeah or green house would be

2674
01:48:13,289 --> 01:48:17,880
perfect anything should if you've got

2675
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:20,010
locks on your gate I take them coupe

2676
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,170
yeah or just backyard in general I think

2677
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:24,060
that should be enough yeah you did your

2678
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:28,020
you tried your best

2679
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:31,560
so yeah three per adult at residence you

2680
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:33,630
know that's three plants is plenty

2681
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:37,080
enough to grow person an ounce a week

2682
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:40,619
here in southern Colorado you could

2683
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:42,329
produce 52 ounces off of three large

2684
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:44,819
plants and that gives you an ounce a

2685
01:48:42,329 --> 01:48:47,819
week which would save I'm gonna do some

2686
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:50,069
fake math here I'm gonna go low I'm

2687
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:51,869
gonna guess that an ounce is about 300

2688
01:48:50,069 --> 01:48:54,299
bucks inter-disciplinary sure yeah

2689
01:48:51,869 --> 01:48:56,699
medical medical medical so okay well

2690
01:48:54,300 --> 01:49:00,420
that's time racket to you anymore

2691
01:48:56,699 --> 01:49:03,239
reckless a400m Wow so we're looking at

2692
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:04,560
400 bucks times 52 I don't need a

2693
01:49:03,239 --> 01:49:06,599
calculator to know that I'm gonna save a

2694
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,890
[ __ ] ton of money yes yes it's like

2695
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:14,550
switching to Geico just by growing

2696
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:16,920
outdoors guy code there we go I fixed

2697
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:18,119
the sound issue God okay yeah this piece

2698
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,500
right here needs to go we're gonna smash

2699
01:49:18,119 --> 01:49:23,579
it with a hammer after the show the

2700
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:25,109
ballast the ballast um that's awesome I

2701
01:49:23,579 --> 01:49:30,630
think that may have been why it took us

2702
01:49:25,109 --> 01:49:32,099
a while to realize it growers I when I

2703
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:33,630
drew it home all the time I would wake

2704
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,660
up and not hear the hum and that's when

2705
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:40,520
you know something's wrong

2706
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:44,340
look in the flower it's off okay yeah so

2707
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,230
you know don't grow it in front everyone

2708
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:50,039
don't rub it in anyone's face you know

2709
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:52,019
keep it in your backyard fence secured

2710
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:54,149
if you live in Pueblo just grow a bunch

2711
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:56,460
of weed yeah what you have to worry

2712
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:57,719
about I've got security written down

2713
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:59,640
yeah

2714
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:01,289
thieves are your biggest problem here in

2715
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,700
Pueblo other than let the cops aren't

2716
01:50:01,289 --> 01:50:04,529
even that big of a deal no it's not

2717
01:50:02,699 --> 01:50:06,659
around here cops are cool whoa

2718
01:50:04,529 --> 01:50:08,489
I've had a few run-ins with them this is

2719
01:50:06,659 --> 01:50:10,800
cool this is a weird Avenue for me to

2720
01:50:08,489 --> 01:50:12,269
even go down but think about what you're

2721
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,770
bringing when you're setting up an

2722
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:15,590
outdoor garden if you do run into a

2723
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:17,640
thief if you do catch somebody out there

2724
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:19,319
think about what you're going to do

2725
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:21,270
before the time comes because everybody

2726
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:22,529
has a they've got big balls when they're

2727
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:24,030
thinking and talking but you're gonna

2728
01:50:22,529 --> 01:50:25,139
have to deal with some [ __ ] if that does

2729
01:50:24,029 --> 01:50:26,880
happen so think about what you're

2730
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:28,770
bringing I know that's a shitty Avenue

2731
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,189
to go down set up some security cameras

2732
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:34,360
have a dog yeah

2733
01:50:30,189 --> 01:50:36,219
dumb dogs do wonders and getting your

2734
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:40,958
stuff ripped off is a very humbling

2735
01:50:36,219 --> 01:50:47,078
experience yeah and it also there's

2736
01:50:40,958 --> 01:50:50,800
there's a few stages of it it's gone

2737
01:50:47,078 --> 01:50:54,429
yeah could it be everyone was everyone

2738
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:55,869
yeah and then it wasn't anyone and then

2739
01:50:54,429 --> 01:50:57,788
you find it on the somebody selling you

2740
01:50:55,868 --> 01:51:02,198
an eighth of it on the street and then

2741
01:50:57,788 --> 01:51:03,668
you're just glad you tried so yeah

2742
01:51:02,198 --> 01:51:04,928
that's a weird Avenue to even mention

2743
01:51:03,668 --> 01:51:06,279
but be prepared what you're gonna do

2744
01:51:04,929 --> 01:51:07,989
because somebody may attempt to steal

2745
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:10,090
your [ __ ] and please don't shoot them

2746

over marijuana grow more next year yeah

2747
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:14,139

01:51:11,948 --> 01:51:15,549
marijuana yeah don't shoot anybody over

2749

2754
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,208

much follow the directions on the back

2835
01:54:48,609 --> 01:54:57,819
of the boxes you know bugs should we

2836
01:54:55,569 --> 01:54:59,559
have done anything by now for bugs or

2837
01:54:57,819 --> 01:55:01,329
animals or pests or anything outdoors

2838
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,560
see on the door guys so Allah I'm

2839
01:55:01,329 --> 01:55:03,579
learning with you on this or I'm

2840
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,310
learning with the listeners on this

2841
01:55:03,579 --> 01:55:08,199
outdoor lesson it's my opinion here in

2842
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:12,190
the Colorado there are more good bugs

2843
01:55:08,199 --> 01:55:16,720
outside than our bad bugs pesticides

2844
01:55:12,189 --> 01:55:19,839
outside I've never used them okay so in

2845
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:22,119
my in my ideal world whatever is eating

2846
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:25,050
my plant today tomorrow something is

2847
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:27,670
going to come to eat that critter

2848
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:29,529
tomorrow somebody will eat that and

2849
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:31,659
hopefully mother nature and the eco will

2850
01:55:29,529 --> 01:55:35,319
balance me out yeah okay and that's why

2851
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:37,269
organics are so important outdoors you

2852
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:40,149
know when you dump salts and stuff like

2853
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:42,310
that into the earth it kills it and it

2854
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:44,409
kills the beetles and it kills the bugs

2855
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:46,930
and which kills the birds which kills

2856
01:55:44,409 --> 01:55:48,609
the bees when he says salts he's talking

2857
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:50,140
about bottled nutrients almost

2858
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:53,109
everything we're buying in a bottle yeah

2859
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:56,890
be it veganic or organic it's a salt

2860
01:55:53,109 --> 01:55:59,259
based nutrient yeah yeah related yes

2861
01:55:56,890 --> 01:56:01,990
which mostly just kills all your mykos

2862
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:05,380
anyway so now we've got healthy fats oil

2863
01:56:01,989 --> 01:56:06,729
rich soil we got some tall plants in

2864
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:08,920
there they're top they're starting to

2865
01:56:06,729 --> 01:56:10,329
grow those are gonna get out of hand bro

2866
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,369
because we just topped him like 50 times

2867
01:56:10,329 --> 01:56:15,369
they got a bunch of heads how do we keep

2868
01:56:12,369 --> 01:56:18,640
that under control well you can take

2869
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:22,180
like some 4x4 metal fencing hog fencing

2870
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:26,619
I think it's commonly referred to make

2871
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:30,390
up 36 48 inch wide

2872
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:35,590
a super tomato cage basically okay

2873
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:40,210
fasten it to the ground and you're able

2874
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:42,850
to pull the plant down and redirect the

2875
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:44,109
growth so you want to spread it out just

2876
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,550
like you would endorse to kind of get

2877
01:56:44,109 --> 01:56:48,429
the light down the Sun down in there

2878
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:51,940
yeah yeah you're able to make the plant

2879
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:56,890
bigger it's also a good security device

2880
01:56:51,939 --> 01:56:58,960
oh there you go to turn it yes very much

2881
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:59,320
maybe tie a belt or two to that cage oh

2882
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,350
yeah

2883
01:56:59,319 --> 01:57:04,380
yeah you see that Lincoln that wakes up

2884
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:06,760
your little chihuahua

2885
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:08,230
so what's he run out there and rescue

2886
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:09,190
the crop hopefully you're just scaring

2887
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:11,619
away some punks

2888
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:13,269
nobody tough yeah all right so I'm

2889
01:57:11,619 --> 01:57:15,099
picturing like this big cylinder of

2890
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:17,440
tomato caging essentially it looks like

2891
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:19,270
maybe like my plants in a cage and I'm

2892
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:20,949
gonna put that on early enough to where

2893
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:23,530
my plant has I don't have to struggle to

2894
01:57:20,949 --> 01:57:25,119
get my plant into that right yeah so 36

2895
01:57:23,529 --> 01:57:26,409
to 48 inches you guys that's three to

2896
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:28,149
four feet around that's what we're

2897
01:57:26,409 --> 01:57:30,309
planning on this little tiny 18 inch

2898
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:33,579
plant turning into how tall do I need

2899
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:36,070
that my cage um five six foot okay you

2900
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:39,489
know alright most privacy foot six foot

2901
01:57:36,069 --> 01:57:42,609
so unfortunately I've always grown

2902
01:57:39,489 --> 01:57:49,630
behind privacy fence make it six inches

2903
01:57:42,609 --> 01:57:52,119
shorter than the fence you know so your

2904
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:53,560
your nodes the arms of the plant are

2905
01:57:52,119 --> 01:57:55,840
gonna grow up basically and you're gonna

2906
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:57,220
want to grab one of those and weave it

2907
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,750
through that tomato cage where the

2908
01:57:57,220 --> 01:58:01,119
outside looks like it's got just a bunch

2909
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:02,890
of arms poking out okay yeah yeah okay

2910
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,939
and then those will be strong enough to

2911
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:05,920
hold themselves up because they've been

2912
01:58:03,939 --> 01:58:07,960
outdoors I'm not gonna need to stake

2913
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:11,980
them after that hopefully yeah another

2914
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:16,720
thing is a good thing to hook this cage

2915
01:58:11,979 --> 01:58:19,989
to is like a wooden frame made out like

2916
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:22,090
four by fours that also helps hold the

2917
01:58:19,989 --> 01:58:24,309
water in for the plant so you can water

2918
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:26,319
it proper amounts and everything okay so

2919
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:28,270
like a slightly raised bed yes like

2920
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:31,090
basically a little micro bed

2921
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:34,480
you know and a depression in the ground

2922
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:36,760
there these these plants will use up to

2923
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:38,769
five gallons of water a day easily Wow

2924
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,239
even more so keep that in mind you guys

2925
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:41,500
for these plants that we're planting if

2926
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:44,199
you're doing three of them to stay legal

2927
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:45,010
you need 15 gallons of water a day so

2928
01:58:44,199 --> 01:58:46,119
you're gonna have to think about how

2929
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:47,739
you're gonna get that water there if

2930
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:49,420
you're doing it somewhere that's that's

2931
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:52,149
by the time they're blooming easily

2932
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:54,430
that's that's the biggest thing outdoors

2933
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:56,099
this keeps those guys pondered yes yeah

2934
01:58:54,430 --> 01:59:00,030
I don't want water water lots of water

2935
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:03,400
it's really really hard to overwater in

2936
01:59:00,029 --> 01:59:05,229
southern Colorado soil really hard for

2937
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:08,199
marijuana especially that outdoor Sun we

2938
01:59:05,229 --> 01:59:10,000
get here do you think the this is random

2939
01:59:08,199 --> 01:59:12,220
do you think the difference we get in

2940
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,689
the heat during the day in the cold at

2941
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:15,610
night plays a big difference in the

2942
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:17,739
flavor and potency of our cannabis yes I

2943
01:59:15,609 --> 01:59:19,089
agree we get a lot of tasty fruit the

2944
01:59:17,739 --> 01:59:20,829
cantaloupes and the peaches are

2945
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:22,750
delicious and I think it has something

2946
01:59:20,829 --> 01:59:27,189
to do with that cold sour dealer loves

2947
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:28,569
it really don't tell everybody that do

2948
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:29,710
two things got a good sour decal let's

2949
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:31,509
help them out if they're growing that

2950
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:33,220
sour do you send a notice don't send

2951
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:34,750
anything when you see me share me yeah

2952
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:37,360
if that if you have one those

2953
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:38,920
hard-to-find ones they really there's a

2954
01:59:37,359 --> 01:59:41,439
guy around here with a cut that's just

2955
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:42,670
fire yeah all right so we've got him out

2956
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,769
we're gonna have to do any more pruning

2957
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:46,630
do you wanna indoors I cut off all that

2958
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:47,800
bottom [ __ ] we do lolli popping do you

2959
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:50,529
want to do that as much on an outdoor

2960
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,539
Crocker sure I like to hollow the plants

2961
01:59:50,529 --> 01:59:56,559
out basically like I do the fruit trees

2962
01:59:52,539 --> 01:59:59,680
over in palisade say your plants four

2963
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:02,590
foot in circumference everything you

2964
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:07,079
know this is totally situational but you

2965
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:13,779
know just approximately you know 12 to

2966
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:15,340
18 inches of plant length every I think

2967
02:00:13,779 --> 02:00:19,599
I see what you're saying yeah you're

2968
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:21,800
probably gonna have to okay so you know

2969
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:25,370
from the

2970
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:27,079
from the outside in you know every you

2971
02:00:25,369 --> 02:00:28,550
know about 18 inches you just want

2972
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:30,590
pretty much strip everything off the

2973
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:34,130
main branches Oh God you know if there

2974
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:36,560
isn't a branch itself keep them nice and

2975
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:38,420
hollow that helps air flow in there lots

2976
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,820
of air flow we're talking about molds

2977
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:43,039
earlier bug deterrent bug deterrence you

2978
02:00:40,819 --> 02:00:45,710
don't want moldy we we do who do have

2979
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:47,869
caterpillar caterpillar issues here so

2980
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:49,310
what are those are things we get here

2981
02:00:47,869 --> 02:00:52,340
there are these little orange worms I've

2982
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:53,719
only only happens around here um I've

2983
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:54,560
seen them brown and yellow I've never

2984
02:00:53,719 --> 02:00:56,350
seen again

2985
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,800
orange ones but yeah yeah they totally

2986
02:00:56,350 --> 02:01:02,420
they're from Moss okay boost Moss that

2987
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:04,190
makes good sense to me and that's their

2988
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:07,190
larvae and they're their parents were

2989
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:10,279
way hippie and decided to lay their kids

2990
02:01:07,189 --> 02:01:14,479
a bunch pop plans and it actually

2991
02:01:10,279 --> 02:01:16,309
happens early in the bud development and

2992
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:18,559
you don't really notice it till the

2993
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:20,120
harvest time yeah that's what songs you

2994
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,590
don't find it to harvest and please if

2995
02:01:20,119 --> 02:01:24,019
you do find [ __ ] like that don't make

2996
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:27,860
hash Adam yeah so just just cut it out

2997
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:30,980
of that bud I've never you know you know

2998
02:01:27,859 --> 02:01:32,809
discard that bud it's it doesn't affect

2999
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:36,319
the entire plant it just affects the

3000
02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:39,230
area around the bug itself so that's one

3001
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:41,630
of the few pests that is and does it

3002
02:01:39,229 --> 02:01:43,039
ruin the entire plant that's another

3003
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:44,690
good question what are some of my

3004
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:47,238
pitfalls are gonna be growing outdoors

3005
02:01:44,689 --> 02:01:49,159
in Colorado um if you don't have good

3006
02:01:47,238 --> 02:01:53,448
air circulation in the fall you're gonna

3007
02:01:49,159 --> 02:01:55,429
get out of em old make sure you don't

3008
02:01:53,448 --> 02:01:58,069
over plant your area and you have plenty

3009
02:01:55,429 --> 02:02:01,100
of air circulation around your plant you

3010
02:01:58,069 --> 02:02:02,929
should be fine you know if you plant it

3011
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:04,910
in the forefoot area between your shed

3012
02:02:02,929 --> 02:02:07,429
and your back fence and your side fins

3013
02:02:04,909 --> 02:02:09,738
and there's a bush growing on the side

3014
02:02:07,429 --> 02:02:11,359
and you threw a tarp over the top so the

3015
02:02:09,738 --> 02:02:13,399
neighbors in the second story building

3016
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:16,130
couldn't see you you're probably gonna

3017
02:02:13,399 --> 02:02:19,000
get mold just just like growing indoors

3018
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:23,069
with that aspect but you know plenty of

3019
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:26,460
that mother nature do your thing

3020
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:29,109
spider mites I have seen outdoors here

3021
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:31,748
it's really hard to get that's mostly

3022
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:33,729
from sloppy indoor grows so just

3023
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,649
carrying them out there yeah should be

3024
02:02:33,729 --> 02:02:39,218
taking care of that inside anyway yeah

3025
02:02:35,649 --> 02:02:41,859
and those will ruin your plant a powdery

3026
02:02:39,219 --> 02:02:43,618
mold and you want to talk about sad

3027
02:02:41,859 --> 02:02:46,058
people

3028
02:02:43,618 --> 02:02:48,639
it's one thing to throw away an indoor

3029
02:02:46,059 --> 02:02:50,739
plant because it had one of those things

3030
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,929
throw away an entire outdoor plant is

3031
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:56,529
yeah we're hoping to grow 52 ounces here

3032
02:02:52,929 --> 02:02:57,819
with these three outdoor plants so I've

3033
02:02:56,529 --> 02:02:59,170
only got a couple more questions for you

3034
02:02:57,819 --> 02:03:00,908
know we're gonna turn it we're gonna try

3035
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:02,170
to do segments we're gonna have him back

3036
02:03:00,908 --> 02:03:03,460
in a couple of weeks and well I'm Jesse

3037
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:04,840
back in a couple weeks and then walk

3038
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,889
back a couple weeks after that and

3039
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:08,319
hopefully it'll be harvest time and

3040
02:03:05,889 --> 02:03:09,880
he'll bring some of his outdoor harvest

3041
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:12,009
with him to show us and talk about and

3042
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:15,880
you guys can yeah well I'll talk shop on

3043
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:17,710
the show what day around when am I gonna

3044
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:23,800
go into flower outdoors here in Colorado

3045
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:27,998
this year July 15th around then okay the

3046
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:29,498
hours will start going negative that the

3047
02:03:27,998 --> 02:03:32,319
hours in the day will start getting

3048
02:03:29,498 --> 02:03:34,748
shorter okay up until then they're gonna

3049
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:36,819
start getting longer so cannabis only

3050
02:03:34,748 --> 02:03:39,609
needs about fourteen hours of daylight

3051
02:03:36,819 --> 02:03:41,529
to make it start flowering outdoors when

3052
02:03:39,609 --> 02:03:42,819
the Sun sets this is some trip [ __ ] yeah

3053
02:03:41,529 --> 02:03:44,529
and I may get this wrong when the Sun

3054
02:03:42,819 --> 02:03:46,359
sets it starts putting off a red

3055
02:03:44,529 --> 02:03:48,368
spectrum and that red spectrum triggers

3056
02:03:46,359 --> 02:03:50,439
the hormones in the plant to sleep so it

3057
02:03:48,368 --> 02:03:52,359
kind of tucks it in a lot of people talk

3058
02:03:50,439 --> 02:03:54,339
about well it's not 1212 outside why am

3059
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:55,868
i flower it's that red spectrum in the

3060
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:57,639
Sun it's kind of messing that's not

3061
02:03:55,868 --> 02:03:59,558
messing it's exactly what it should do

3062
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:00,998
it's telling your plants in the night in

3063
02:03:59,559 --> 02:04:03,699
the morning it's blue and that wakes

3064
02:04:00,998 --> 02:04:06,578
them up I've heard I read no old DJ

3065
02:04:03,698 --> 02:04:10,419
short burger no anyway I know GJ short

3066
02:04:06,578 --> 02:04:12,399
is where I heard this it's only about an

3067
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:15,399
hour hour and a half that makes these

3068
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:19,629
plants flower outside versus indoors

3069
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:21,069
it's anywhere from twelve to six hours

3070
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:24,400
difference of light to make some flower

3071
02:04:21,069 --> 02:04:25,899
no it's the equatorial stuff they're

3072
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:28,509
very coming from Thailand and places

3073
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:30,569
like that or more jungle regions and and

3074
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:32,820
outdoors

3075
02:04:30,569 --> 02:04:36,439
different strains a little different

3076
02:04:32,819 --> 02:04:39,929
times so your sativas go first

3077
02:04:36,439 --> 02:04:43,469
I've noticed your landrace plants will

3078
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:45,390
go first to hybrids typically go last so

3079
02:04:43,469 --> 02:04:47,579
okay yeah

3080
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:50,869
when is my when should I really be

3081
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:53,189
focused on getting these things down by

3082
02:04:50,869 --> 02:04:55,529
as far as harvesting yeah what's my

3083
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:56,699
harvest date what's my deadline do I

3084
02:04:55,529 --> 02:04:58,349
just sit outside and watch for that

3085
02:04:56,699 --> 02:05:03,300
first frost if it comes then three hours

3086
02:04:58,350 --> 02:05:05,820
before it freezes the first no that's

3087
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:07,770
really hard to say you know when they're

3088
02:05:05,819 --> 02:05:10,679
done right yeah but by the end of

3089
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:14,550
September it's not gonna freeze and most

3090
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:17,369
plants are acceptable to harvest so safe

3091
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:19,469
safe to take down okay you were talking

3092
02:05:17,369 --> 02:05:21,750
about strain selection without giving me

3093
02:05:19,469 --> 02:05:23,159
any shameless plugs I mean I do know

3094
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:24,779
that a couple of my strains work quite

3095
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:27,809
well outside yeah what kind of stuff

3096
02:05:24,779 --> 02:05:29,399
would work well for the Colorado region

3097
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:30,960
around us and if you know any of the

3098
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:32,549
popular cuts that people have got I know

3099
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:35,000
golden goat is a good outdoor feel it

3100
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:38,719
takes a minute to finish with that girl

3101
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,819
what else would you throw outside like I

3102
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:43,770
suspect heart of gold would kill

3103
02:05:40,819 --> 02:05:46,619
anything with kim de groot does

3104
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:48,870
excellent okay so put some grateful dog

3105
02:05:46,619 --> 02:05:51,988
heart of the old Bounty Killer outside

3106
02:05:48,869 --> 02:05:54,719
would probably amazing float is really

3107
02:05:51,988 --> 02:05:56,218
good flow and blueberry honestly are two

3108
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,750
of the best performing outdoor plants

3109
02:05:56,219 --> 02:05:59,310
I've I've never done my own outdoor but

3110
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:01,109
I have helped a couple of guys and the

3111
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:03,420
flow and the blueberry always blew my

3112
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:05,579
mind when he did him outdoor uh ghost

3113
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:06,869
Bubba does really good outside okay

3114
02:06:05,579 --> 02:06:09,180
that's a good strain too

3115
02:06:06,869 --> 02:06:11,930
Oh doesn't yield good but she tastes

3116
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,930
amazing else

3117
02:06:12,859 --> 02:06:19,819
Golden Girls good Sour Diesel actually

3118
02:06:16,039 --> 02:06:21,769
does pretty good around here some guys

3119
02:06:19,819 --> 02:06:23,630
in a little town yeah outside of here

3120
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:25,610
that make sure that outdoor salad be

3121
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:31,069
shown guys I'm not gonna bust your spot

3122
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:33,738
but [ __ ] out lemon tea short us P pasa

3123
02:06:31,069 --> 02:06:35,689
Colorado green bud no those are all

3124
02:06:33,738 --> 02:06:37,099
local strains I'm gonna pack a short bus

3125
02:06:35,689 --> 02:06:38,869
that somebody handed me at the first

3126
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:40,910
cannabis cup that's from that same

3127
02:06:38,869 --> 02:06:43,039
little town neat yeah they just walked

3128
02:06:40,909 --> 02:06:53,229
by and planted them on me Kenneth going

3129
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:58,279
well yeah if you've got some room

3130
02:06:53,229 --> 02:07:02,839
locally bred strains always do better if

3131
02:06:58,279 --> 02:07:04,729
they were bred here I don't know why but

3132
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:08,630
they do that's their environment that

3133
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:09,738
makes sense to me so um yeah I had one

3134
02:07:08,630 --> 02:07:11,029
more question but I can't think of it

3135
02:07:09,738 --> 02:07:12,889
off the top of my head so we'll save it

3136
02:07:11,029 --> 02:07:14,689
for next time okay those right in 30

3137
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:16,520
minutes bro so if you got any couple

3138
02:07:14,689 --> 02:07:18,969
ending things to end on we can save the

3139
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:21,440
rest for next time or um pest

3140
02:07:18,969 --> 02:07:24,980
pesticides if you do use them please use

3141
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:32,569
like neem oil organic ones don't don't

3142
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:34,039
kill the bees feed with teas but yeah

3143
02:07:32,569 --> 02:07:37,159
we'll get to that next time there we go

3144
02:07:34,039 --> 02:07:39,198
I'll make a note to talk about teas and

3145
02:07:37,159 --> 02:07:42,619
security don't tell anyone that doesn't

3146
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:44,000
need to know that even if it is even if

3147
02:07:42,619 --> 02:07:46,130
you're in a legal state don't tell

3148
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,420
anyone it doesn't need to know that'll

3149
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:49,039
be your first suspect when it gets

3150
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:50,359
stolen and then that's gonna [ __ ] up

3151
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:52,219
friendships yeah and they're unlikely

3152
02:07:50,359 --> 02:07:55,329
that person didn't do it but it's really

3153
02:07:52,219 --> 02:07:57,050
hard not to think they did

3154
02:07:55,329 --> 02:07:58,430
that's great [ __ ]

3155
02:07:57,050 --> 02:08:01,489
one thing I was gonna mention if you're

3156
02:07:58,430 --> 02:08:02,960
gonna get some stuff tested well you

3157
02:08:01,488 --> 02:08:05,569
can't get stuff tested they just changed

3158
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,250
the rules here in Colorado if you were

3159
02:08:05,569 --> 02:08:08,630
able to get stuff tested do you think

3160
02:08:07,250 --> 02:08:10,369
the outdoor stuff is gonna test

3161
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:13,730
considerably higher than the indoor

3162
02:08:10,369 --> 02:08:15,948
stuff I would like to see a indoor I

3163
02:08:13,729 --> 02:08:18,559
suspect is probably gonna have higher

3164
02:08:15,948 --> 02:08:21,509
THC simply because it doesn't have the

3165
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:24,150
dust in the wind in the rain

3166
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:25,890
I think the Sun outnumbers all of that

3167
02:08:24,149 --> 02:08:27,629
in my opinion so we should we should

3168
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:30,630
grow the same strain indoors and out and

3169
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:32,489
see will be for sure what I do think

3170
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:34,319
will happen outdoors is you're gonna

3171
02:08:32,489 --> 02:08:37,529
have a lot of these other cannabinoids

3172
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:39,269
are gonna be off the charts okay so

3173
02:08:37,529 --> 02:08:41,159
that's my theory

3174
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:43,560
so are grow lights we're only bringing

3175
02:08:41,159 --> 02:08:45,090
out specific yeah is that why we're

3176
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:47,880
getting so much Lebanon and things oh

3177
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:49,560
yeah yeah here's something I've never

3178
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:51,150
shared if you want more lemon flavor

3179
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:53,640
I've never I don't think I've told

3180
02:08:51,149 --> 02:08:55,079
anybody this I read it and something I

3181
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:56,640
think it was steep hill or something

3182
02:08:55,079 --> 02:08:58,800
like that long time ago if you want more

3183
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:01,800
lemon flavor lemon can be increased it's

3184
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:03,510
almost a stress reaction by making too

3185
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:04,710
much light and too much heat on the tops

3186
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:07,020
of your plants that will increase your

3187
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:10,850
lemony and lemony limey kind of flavor

3188
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:13,170
mmm safety reaction I think so yeah

3189
02:09:10,850 --> 02:09:14,730
alright there's just over 30 minutes

3190
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,659

take a minute to give thanks to somebody

3212
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,119
I feel has been beneficial or crucial to

3213
02:10:06,989 --> 02:10:10,800
the cannabis movement the past two

3214
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:12,869
episodes I've given thanks to Jorge

3215
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:15,840
Cervantes and Ed Rosenthal because they

3216
02:10:12,869 --> 02:10:17,939
were very important in my my development

3217
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,010
and my education as a cannabis grower so

3218
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:22,309

02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:46,199

02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:47,429

correspondence with the major cannabis

researchers throughout the world and

3240
02:10:58,948 --> 02:11:03,799
this is reflected in the in-depth and

3241
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:06,750
accuracy of his writings on cannabis

3242
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:10,170
Robert Connell Clark is responsible for

3243
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:12,029
a lot of my breeding knowledge he wrote

3244
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:14,250
he wrote a book called marijuana botany

3245
02:11:12,029 --> 02:11:15,029
he also wrote cannabis evolution and

3246
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:17,429
ethnobotany

3247
02:11:15,029 --> 02:11:20,039
and he also wrote the book called

3248
02:11:17,429 --> 02:11:24,118
hashish which also has a updated version

3249
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:25,260
the book marijuana botany every grower

3250
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:27,269
that's trying to reach the next level

3251
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:29,010
should read this book and if you're

3252
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:30,840
thinking about breeding this is the book

3253
02:11:29,010 --> 02:11:33,389
to get this is basically an instruction

3254
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,029
book on how to breed high-grade cannabis

3255

but before we do that I want to read a

3318
02:13:51,788 --> 02:13:55,899
little bit of news a few episodes ago I

3319
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:57,309
told you guys about the Colorado

3320
02:13:55,899 --> 02:13:58,808
Symphony inviting folks to bring

3321
02:13:57,309 --> 02:14:00,369
cannabis to their concerts

3322
02:13:58,809 --> 02:14:02,079
well the concerts have since happened

3323
02:14:00,368 --> 02:14:04,269
and I've got a little article here from

3324
02:14:02,078 --> 02:14:07,029
the Denver Post written by John Wenzel

3325
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:10,710
it's the headline is symphonies first

3326

tie-dyed t-shirts not at first anyway a

3335
02:14:27,908 --> 02:14:32,500
closer look revealed the distinctly

3336
02:14:29,859 --> 02:14:33,939
cannabis-related nature of the event the

3337
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:35,618

Gallery on Santa Fe Drive which was

3346

covered with an l-shaped lofted area

3347

that supported a half-dozen

3348

more small tables also featured vendors

3349

marijuana wafted and regularly from the

3354
02:15:05,649 --> 02:15:09,429
wide garage door that opened into the

3355
02:15:07,179 --> 02:15:11,319
patio which led to another small outdoor

3356
02:15:09,429 --> 02:15:12,730
area with food trucks and a pair of ice

3357
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:14,729
cream and popsicle vendors where

3358
02:15:12,729 --> 02:15:17,229
attendees also openly smoked cannabis

3359
02:15:14,729 --> 02:15:19,029
we're bridging the gap between classical

3360
02:15:17,229 --> 02:15:21,578
music and marijuana in both directions

3361
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:23,529
at Morgan Carr co-owner co-owner of

3362
02:15:21,578 --> 02:15:25,569
wellspring as he showed off the

3363
02:15:23,529 --> 02:15:27,670
complimentary vaporizer pins preloaded

3364
02:15:25,569 --> 02:15:30,519
with hash oil and wellspring branded

3365
02:15:27,670 --> 02:15:31,989
glass jars and disposable lighters the

3366
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:33,760
event which was switched from public to

3367
02:15:31,988 --> 02:15:36,339
private after the city of Denver warned

3368
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:38,139
the CSO about the illegalities of public

3369
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:40,090
marijuana consumption has garnered

3370
02:15:38,139 --> 02:15:42,400
international attention and speculation

3371
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:45,099
since it was announced the 250 or so

3372
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:47,379
attendees shelled out at least $75 per

3373
02:15:45,099 --> 02:15:49,538
person to support the CSO s experiment

3374
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:51,918
in culture bridging but it's kind of

3375
02:15:49,538 --> 02:15:55,309
take a second right here that's

3376
02:15:51,918 --> 02:15:57,408
these guys had to change their their

3377
02:15:55,309 --> 02:16:00,320
idea from a public [ __ ] smoke marijuana

3378
02:15:57,408 --> 02:16:01,819
with us to make it a private event these

3379
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:02,958
little gray areas are [ __ ] we need

3380
02:16:01,819 --> 02:16:04,639
to learn how to get it together so we

3381
02:16:02,958 --> 02:16:07,398
can all consume cannabis safely together

3382
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:09,469
anyway look around this is not stoner

3383
02:16:07,399 --> 02:16:11,869
town said Evan Lasky executive vice

3384
02:16:09,469 --> 02:16:13,788
president of the CSO who characterized

3385
02:16:11,868 --> 02:16:16,308
the series as just another design to tap

3386
02:16:13,788 --> 02:16:18,259
into new donors we have we have to build

3387
02:16:16,309 --> 02:16:20,149
new audiences because the older people

3388
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:22,849
are dying off we have to fight this

3389
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:25,039
perception of elitism the CSO brass

3390
02:16:22,849 --> 02:16:27,168
quintet dressed in all black suits with

3391

3394
02:16:32,689 --> 02:16:36,829
by short speeches from the CSO and

3395
02:16:34,488 --> 02:16:38,179
sponsors acoustics in the unadorned

3396
02:16:36,829 --> 02:16:39,920
space were sharp and bright as the

3397
02:16:38,179 --> 02:16:42,260
quintet continued with recognizable

3398
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:44,329
classic favorites the chatter of side

3399
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:46,099
conversations from attendees who stood

3400
02:16:44,329 --> 02:16:48,079
are milled about due to the casual non

3401
02:16:46,099 --> 02:16:50,179
seated set up nearly rivaled the content

3402
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:52,459
of volume at times compared to the

3403
02:16:50,179 --> 02:16:54,619
average Red Rock Show it was a state

3404
02:16:52,459 --> 02:16:56,750
affair but is unlikely any sponsored

3405
02:16:54,619 --> 02:16:58,969
official classic music event with the

3406
02:16:56,750 --> 02:17:01,369
city organization has ever attracted so

3407
02:16:58,968 --> 02:17:03,049
so much open marijuana consumption or

3408
02:17:01,369 --> 02:17:05,359

already been secured in sponsorship for

3413
02:17:11,388 --> 02:17:15,259
the night and CSO officials confirmed

3414
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:17,658
another twenty thousand dollars was

3415

garnered from attendees the CSO is

3416
02:17:17,658 --> 02:17:21,439
hoping to raise $200,000 from the

3417

event at Red Rocks this summer

3420
02:17:25,299 --> 02:17:29,778
there didn't used to be any events I

3421
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,519
felt welcomed that said West but after a

3422
02:17:29,779 --> 02:17:33,199
legalization happened we wanted to start

3423
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:35,929
putting on events to it we would

3424
02:17:33,199 --> 02:17:38,000
actually go to for their part the CSO

3425
02:17:35,929 --> 02:17:40,040
musicians treated it just like another

3426
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,540
gig even as the smell of we began

3427
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,739
wafting to the opposite side of the

3428
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:44,719
gallery where they warmed up in a

3429
02:17:42,738 --> 02:17:46,670
private room we loved playing chamber

3430
02:17:44,718 --> 02:17:49,398
music wherever said Trump trombone

3431
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:51,049
player Gregg Harper it is what it is

3432
02:17:49,398 --> 02:17:52,368
we're just going to play the pieces we

3433
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:55,459
know and hopefully people will

3434
02:17:52,369 --> 02:17:56,750
appreciate it well it sounds like a lot

3435
02:17:55,459 --> 02:17:58,308
of people appreciated it there are

3436
02:17:56,750 --> 02:18:00,049
plenty of people in attendance and a lot

3437
02:17:58,308 --> 02:18:03,108
of money was made so why can't this be

3438
02:18:00,049 --> 02:18:03,978
an example there were no negative events

3439
02:18:03,109 --> 02:18:05,238
there were no fight

3440

there were no crimes committed here

3441
02:18:05,238 --> 02:18:10,868
there's a great great event why can't we

3442
02:18:08,029 --> 02:18:12,920
do this at Red Rocks why can't they say

3443

3445
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:18,169

3483

3484
02:19:33,078 --> 02:19:36,619
cookout complete with volleyball and

3485
02:19:34,549 --> 02:19:38,478
other entertainment at the formal Canyon

3486
02:19:36,619 --> 02:19:40,248
floral building at 111 Main Street

3487
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:41,658
before the March she said about a

3488
02:19:40,248 --> 02:19:45,818
hundred people attended the cookout

3489
02:19:41,658 --> 02:19:47,959
ranging in age from early 20s to the 80s

3490
02:19:45,818 --> 02:19:50,389
they weren't from the 80s they're in

3491
02:19:47,959 --> 02:19:52,728
their eighties the response was more

3492
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:54,170
positive than negatives who said we were

3493
02:19:52,728 --> 02:19:55,969
kind of surprised we weren't sure how

3494
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,439
people were going to feel about it we

3495
02:19:55,969 --> 02:19:59,269
got a lot of honks and people screaming

3496
02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:01,068
and waving the group ended the march at

3497
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:02,810
City Hall where participants sat in on

3498
02:20:01,068 --> 02:20:04,158
the city council meeting sue said they

3499
02:20:02,809 --> 02:20:05,748
wanted to show the council that there

3500
02:20:04,158 --> 02:20:07,998
are supporters for retail marijuana in

3501
02:20:05,748 --> 02:20:09,439
the community the last meeting was in

3502
02:20:07,998 --> 02:20:10,939
the middle of the day and it's kind of

3503
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:13,488
hard for people who work to get there

3504
02:20:10,939 --> 02:20:15,050
she said City Council members Kevin dip

3505
02:20:13,488 --> 02:20:16,879
Maura Colby catch Miranda

3506
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:18,769
why'd walked with the group for part of

3507
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:20,329
the March I'm glad to see that there's

3508
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:21,560
some Pro retail marijuana people

3509
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:23,659
starting to show up for some of our

3510
02:20:21,559 --> 02:20:25,340
events wide said we've made no secret

3511
02:20:23,659 --> 02:20:27,318
about it that I certainly am in favor of

3512
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:29,270
it I think it's ridiculous for us to

3513
02:20:27,318 --> 02:20:30,829
turn over control of retail marijuana to

3514
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:33,170
our neighboring cities Pueblo West and

3515
02:20:30,829 --> 02:20:35,059
Salida I think we should be the ones who

3516
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:36,680
control what goes on here the general

3517
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:38,478
government Committee on May 7th by

3518
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:40,398
majority agreement elected to extend the

3519
02:20:38,478 --> 02:20:42,318
moratorium beyond the November election

3520
02:20:40,398 --> 02:20:44,329
to allow a vote on the matter and set

3521
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:46,369
the question to be asked on the November

3522
02:20:44,329 --> 02:20:49,489
4th ballot the current moratorium

3523
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:51,140
expires July 1st the ordinances are

3524
02:20:49,489 --> 02:20:53,030
expected to be presented to Council for

3525
02:20:51,139 --> 02:20:54,920
first reading during the June 2nd

3526
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:56,840
meeting and if approved second reading

3527
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:59,420
and adoption would be during the June

3528
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,159
16th meeting city administrator Doug

3529
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:02,780
Dotson said the first ordinance would

3530
02:21:01,159 --> 02:21:05,139
extend the moratorium and would set

3531
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:07,489
question on the ballot for public vote

3532
02:21:05,139 --> 02:21:09,139
the second ordinance would ask if the

3533
02:21:07,489 --> 02:21:11,629
first one approved if there should be

3534
02:21:09,139 --> 02:21:14,029
additional sales or excise tax on the

3535
02:21:11,629 --> 02:21:15,500
sale of retail marijuana so I want to

3536
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:17,060
highly advise them to vote against that

3537
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:19,939
because when we legalize recreational

3538
02:21:17,059 --> 02:21:21,289
cannabis here in Pueblo I in the county

3539
02:21:19,939 --> 02:21:24,250
when the shops opened up they are

3540
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:27,830
required to charge 25 percent tax on

3541
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:31,609
anything so if you buy a hundred dollar

3542
02:21:27,829 --> 02:21:33,590
bag it's now a 125 dollar bag so vote

3543
02:21:31,609 --> 02:21:36,020
that down if you get the option let's

3544
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:37,939
get back into the article during

3545
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:39,530
Monday's meeting Mayor Tony Greer said

3546
02:21:37,939 --> 02:21:41,510
there's a rumor circulating that there

3547
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:42,920
is a conspiracy for catch mar to recuse

3548
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:44,870
himself from voting on the retail

3549
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:47,359
marijuana issue specifically so that

3550
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:49,550
Grier can vote in favor where said that

3551
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:51,439
is not true I have not made up my mind

3552
02:21:49,549 --> 02:21:53,719
on that Grier said that is why we have

3553
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:55,520
public hearing when clarifying the May 7

3554
02:21:53,719 --> 02:21:56,779
meeting minutes catch Maher said during

3555
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:58,100
that meeting he thought it looks like a

3556
02:21:56,780 --> 02:22:00,079
good idea to send the issue to voters

3557
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:02,809
but at this point he does need to

3558
02:22:00,079 --> 02:22:05,090
abstain I don't know if it's going to be

3559
02:22:02,809 --> 02:22:08,228
kicked back he said I'm really not sure

3560
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:11,239
where we are going with it at this point

3561
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:13,398
all right so there's no certainty in the

3562
02:22:11,239 --> 02:22:15,889
future of recreational marijuana in

3563
02:22:13,398 --> 02:22:18,019
Canyon City if you guys are in Canyon

3564
02:22:15,889 --> 02:22:19,250
City do what you got to do to get out

3565
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:21,500
there and vote get out there and wave

3566
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:23,959
signs encourage your your Congress

3567
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:25,129
people we got to get some recreational

3568
02:22:23,959 --> 02:22:26,379
cannabis for you guys out there in

3569
02:22:25,129 --> 02:22:27,938
Canyon City

3570
02:22:26,379 --> 02:22:29,369
I got another news article up here and

3571
02:22:27,939 --> 02:22:33,000
then we're gonna get into the hash

3572
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:36,760
section of the show as promised

3573
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,200
do a little hash 101 and speaking of

3574
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:40,750
hash that brings me into our next news

3575
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:42,909
article this article is written by mr.

3576
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:45,189
William breeds the headline is new

3577
02:22:42,909 --> 02:22:49,059
Colorado hash laws signed by governor

3578
02:22:45,189 --> 02:22:51,309
the what do they actually do the article

3579
02:22:49,059 --> 02:22:52,898
says yesterday Governor John

3580
02:22:51,309 --> 02:22:55,148
Hickenlooper signed a baker's dozen

3581
02:22:52,898 --> 02:22:56,949
worth of bills on various topics but

3582
02:22:55,148 --> 02:22:58,510
arguably the two most high-profile

3583
02:22:56,950 --> 02:23:01,780
measures had to do with marijuana

3584
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:03,790
legislation to establish a one ounce of

3585
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:05,860
cannabis equivalent for concentrates and

3586
02:23:03,790 --> 02:23:09,310
a proposal to make marijuana edibles

3587
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:10,989
more identifiable a prominent marijuana

3588
02:23:09,309 --> 02:23:13,180
advocate praises these measures as

3589
02:23:10,989 --> 02:23:14,739
examples of responsible legislation even

3590
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:17,260
though it's quite unclear at this point

3591
02:23:14,739 --> 02:23:18,909
what the new laws will actually do the

3592
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:20,319
summary notes that the bill directs the

3593
02:23:18,909 --> 02:23:22,478
Department of Revenue to promulgate

3594
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:24,219
rules establishing the equivalent of one

3595
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:26,769
ounce of retail marijuana flower in

3596
02:23:24,219 --> 02:23:28,420
various retail marijuana products the

3597
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:30,399
bill authorizes the department to

3598
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:32,290
contract for a scientific study of the

3599
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:34,299
equivalency of marijuana flower in

3600
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:35,830
marijuana products but there's no

3601
02:23:34,299 --> 02:23:37,840
telling what that means in practical

3602
02:23:35,829 --> 02:23:40,319
terms as the westward outlines in the

3603
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:42,729
following excerpt

3604
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:44,710
the legislation is vague on the

3605
02:23:42,729 --> 02:23:47,199
specifics of determining just how much

3606
02:23:44,710 --> 02:23:48,699
hash is in an ounce of herb which

3607
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,320
depends on how strong the ounce of herb

3608
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:52,421
is to begin with we kind of talked about

3609
02:23:50,319 --> 02:23:54,520
that on this show once a couple episodes

3610
02:23:52,421 --> 02:23:57,671
ago what they base it on a thirty

3611
02:23:54,521 --> 02:24:00,311
percent THC og Fino or a low THC batch

3612
02:23:57,671 --> 02:24:02,291
of something like blueberries even then

3613
02:24:00,310 --> 02:24:04,720
it's unclear whether legislators want

3614
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:06,520
producers to measure total THC in an

3615
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:09,220
ounce or simply estimate how much hash

3616
02:24:06,521 --> 02:24:10,989
can can be produced from an ounce all of

3617
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:12,640
this would widely impact the amount of

3618
02:24:10,989 --> 02:24:14,800
concentrates that are legally approved

3619
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:17,529
for sale say for the sake of discussion

3620
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:20,171
that the DOR determines that there are 5

3621
02:24:17,530 --> 02:24:22,391
grams of pure THC in an out to verb that

3622
02:24:20,171 --> 02:24:24,161
could mean it's in state residents 21

3623
02:24:22,390 --> 02:24:26,229
and up would be able to purchase about 6

3624
02:24:24,161 --> 02:24:28,421
grams worth of ninety percent THC hash

3625
02:24:26,229 --> 02:24:29,921
oil since out-of-state residents are

3626
02:24:28,421 --> 02:24:31,690
transient currently limited to

3627
02:24:29,921 --> 02:24:33,431
purchasing a quarter ounce of cannabis

3628
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:35,501
they'd hypothetically only be able to

3629
02:24:33,431 --> 02:24:36,700
buy one or two grams at a time that's I

3630
02:24:35,501 --> 02:24:39,101
think that's what Kevin and I agreed to

3631
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:41,081
the last time we talked about this but

3632
02:24:39,101 --> 02:24:42,489
if the lab the state chooses bases its

3633
02:24:41,081 --> 02:24:44,261
findings on how much hash can be

3634
02:24:42,489 --> 02:24:46,239
produced from an ounce of herb the

3635
02:24:44,261 --> 02:24:47,771
amounts can be much lower we've spoken

3636
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:49,690
with several hash makers who tell us

3637
02:24:47,771 --> 02:24:51,461
that 15 that a 15 percent average

3638
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:53,860
returned from bud to concentrate is

3639
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:55,779
reasonable for vho extraction which

3640
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:58,030
means they get about 4 grams of hash for

3641
02:24:55,780 --> 02:25:00,521
every ounce of herb ice water can be

3642
02:24:58,030 --> 02:25:02,801
even lower only 8 to 10% resulting in

3643
02:25:00,521 --> 02:25:06,551
top grade smokeable hash and the rest

3644
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:09,760
suitable mostly for cooking I've seen

3645
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:11,739
people get 20 or 22 percent returns from

3646
02:25:09,761 --> 02:25:14,411
some BHO and actually I saw a guy get

3647
02:25:11,739 --> 02:25:15,819
thirty four percent return on some live

3648
02:25:14,411 --> 02:25:18,220
resin the other day but that's not the

3649
02:25:15,819 --> 02:25:20,710
point here the point is they're trying

3650
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:23,140
to figure out how much hash that they

3651
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:25,420
can sell us and how much hash is equal

3652
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:26,890
to the limit of we were actually able to

3653
02:25:25,421 --> 02:25:29,470
buy now because people are coming from

3654
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:31,479
other states I know I pick on Texas a

3655
02:25:29,470 --> 02:25:33,790
lot but they're coming from Texas and

3656
02:25:31,479 --> 02:25:37,449
Oklahoma and they're buying seven grams

3657
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:40,210
of hash and it seems sketchy to some

3658
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:41,771
people I don't think it's sketchy

3659
02:25:40,210 --> 02:25:43,270
because when the dispensaries had a lot

3660
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:44,940
of hash available that was good and I

3661
02:25:43,271 --> 02:25:47,471
was new at the hash game I would go by

3662
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:49,030
if they had the Durbin poison hash I

3663
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:50,709
would say can I have all of that please

3664
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:52,780
and I didn't think that was sketchy

3665
02:25:50,709 --> 02:25:54,309
all right that's enough for the news I'm

3666
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:54,909
gonna take a quick dab and a drink of

3667
02:25:54,309 --> 02:26:01,930
something here

3668
02:25:54,909 --> 02:26:03,129
and I am going to get into dab 101 while

3669
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:05,260
I take a DAB you guys should go check

3670
02:26:03,129 --> 02:26:06,759
out oil slick Pat calm you're dabbing

3671
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:08,889
with me you're gonna need something from

3672
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:09,430
oil slick stop getting your mom's table

3673
02:26:08,889 --> 02:26:11,959
all sticky

3674
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:15,040

3677
02:26:44,329 --> 02:26:47,940
all right stoner dudes and stoner chicks

3678
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:55,680
gather round

3679
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:58,230
it's time for dab 101 all right we're

3680
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:01,440
here for dabs 101 let's start with this

3681
02:26:58,229 --> 02:27:03,209
one what is a DAB a DAB is basically a

3682
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:06,300
hint of the cannabis concentrate which

3683
02:27:03,209 --> 02:27:07,949
is usually Pho in my world some solvent

3684
02:27:06,299 --> 02:27:11,489
list is dabble but for now we're just

3685
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:15,329
gonna focus on pho pho is short for

3686
02:27:11,489 --> 02:27:18,059
butane honey oil pho is hash made with

3687
02:27:15,329 --> 02:27:20,489
butane and the butane is then purged off

3688
02:27:18,059 --> 02:27:23,250
and the results are BHO of different

3689
02:27:20,489 --> 02:27:26,729
consistencies now I did say it's made

3690
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:28,530
with butane but after that the hash is

3691
02:27:26,729 --> 02:27:30,569
put into a vacuum chamber and heated and

3692
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:32,370
the butane is removed that way so you're

3693
02:27:30,569 --> 02:27:34,049
not dabbing any butane if it's done

3694
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:36,390
properly I'm not gonna teach you guys

3695
02:27:34,049 --> 02:27:37,679
how to make BHL because I don't want to

3696
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:40,079
be responsible for you guys hurting

3697
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,970
ourselves no matter how many times we

3698
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:43,530
say it no matter how many news reports

3699
02:27:41,969 --> 02:27:46,409
we see a people getting hurt people

3700
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:50,100
still insist on blasting hash indoors so

3701
02:27:46,409 --> 02:27:53,010
please stop making pho inside it's not

3702
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:56,190
safe alright so I'm saying we get

3703
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:57,569
different consistencies of pho some of

3704
02:27:56,190 --> 02:28:00,860
those different consistencies get

3705
02:27:57,569 --> 02:28:04,920
different names like they're shatter wax

3706
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:07,319
crumble Earl Sapp other snap and Peele

3707
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:10,049
and then also there's the new thing

3708
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:11,850
which is called live resin so I'll

3709
02:28:10,049 --> 02:28:14,459
describe them to you and I'm gonna start

3710
02:28:11,850 --> 02:28:18,149
with shatter shatter is usually amber in

3711
02:28:14,459 --> 02:28:19,859
color it's usually it should shatter

3712
02:28:18,149 --> 02:28:21,389
well if you try to break it but if you

3713
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:23,579
heat it up with your fingers it will get

3714
02:28:21,389 --> 02:28:25,229
sticky and it'll be bendable but when

3715
02:28:23,579 --> 02:28:27,270
you first pick it up it should be snappy

3716
02:28:25,229 --> 02:28:29,430
it should break like maybe like a thin

3717
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:30,200
Jolly Rancher candy or something like

3718
02:28:29,430 --> 02:28:32,579
that

3719
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:34,200
most of what you're picking up now what

3720
02:28:32,579 --> 02:28:35,760
we're finding now is shatter from the

3721
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:38,130
dispensaries and stuff like that it's

3722
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:40,380
really close to shatter

3723
02:28:38,129 --> 02:28:42,479
really close to shatter there's another

3724
02:28:40,379 --> 02:28:44,849
type that's called sap or snap and peel

3725
02:28:42,479 --> 02:28:46,709
it's really the same color of shatter

3726
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:48,870
it's that ambery gold color it can be

3727
02:28:46,709 --> 02:28:51,270
anywhere from like a dark amber it's

3728
02:28:48,870 --> 02:28:53,100
almost a bright yellow I've got some

3729
02:28:51,271 --> 02:28:57,060
right now that's really dark it was done

3730
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:57,390
with some flow and it's got some tangen

3731
02:28:57,059 --> 02:28:59,069
there

3732
02:28:57,389 --> 02:29:01,319
it's fluent and we've been calling it

3733
02:28:59,069 --> 02:29:02,909
the flange or the flange erine or the

3734
02:29:01,319 --> 02:29:05,579
tangelo we kind of [ __ ] around with the

3735
02:29:02,909 --> 02:29:07,110
names a lot but that one comes out a

3736
02:29:05,579 --> 02:29:09,510
little bit darker for some reason and

3737
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:10,800
then there's some freedom thai lemon

3738
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:12,540
baby dabs it have been being made

3739
02:29:10,799 --> 02:29:15,389
recently that are coming out really

3740
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:16,650
white light golden yellow so it's all

3741
02:29:15,389 --> 02:29:19,109
about the product and all about the

3742
02:29:16,649 --> 02:29:22,260
starting material it'll make different

3743
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:24,420
colors so the sap and the snap and field

3744
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:28,079
looked very similar in color and texture

3745
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:30,090
to the shatter but they of course SAP is

3746
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:31,649
kind of sappy its stickier when he

3747
02:29:30,090 --> 02:29:33,780
folded up in parchment paper it sticks

3748
02:29:31,649 --> 02:29:36,809
to the parchment paper sticks to your

3749
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:38,280
fingers it's kind of goopy err there's

3750
02:29:36,809 --> 02:29:41,100
something that's right between shatter

3751
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:43,350
and SAP I call it snap and peel it

3752
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:45,059
doesn't shatter like shatter does and it

3753
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:46,829
doesn't stick but it kind of breaks off

3754
02:29:45,059 --> 02:29:48,930
it's sort of like a Laffy Taffy kind of

3755
02:29:46,829 --> 02:29:50,549
like the Laffy Taffy of hash so you can

3756
02:29:48,930 --> 02:29:52,079
pull off enough to get a good dab you

3757
02:29:50,549 --> 02:29:54,959
can mess with it long enough to get it

3758
02:29:52,079 --> 02:29:56,969
on the dabber and handle it but it

3759
02:29:54,959 --> 02:29:58,319
doesn't break off and it doesn't stick

3760
02:29:56,969 --> 02:29:58,859
so it's kind of nice that's one of your

3761
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:00,539
better ones

3762
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:01,950
it's the snap in feel and I also think

3763
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:04,771
that it's higher quality most of the

3764
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:06,630
time when it's the snap in peel that

3765
02:30:04,771 --> 02:30:08,659
style usually seems to have a lot of

3766
02:30:06,629 --> 02:30:11,909
flavor to it in my opinion

3767
02:30:08,659 --> 02:30:13,649
so there's also wax wax is real popular

3768
02:30:11,909 --> 02:30:16,289
in the dispensaries and it's kind of

3769
02:30:13,649 --> 02:30:17,789
easy to make a lot of the wax people are

3770
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:20,250
skipping a step and they're doing the

3771
02:30:17,790 --> 02:30:22,470
whip part too soon but that's the main

3772
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:24,750
difference between shatter and wax right

3773
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:26,399
towards the end there you basically whip

3774
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:28,649
it like it's a cake battery stir it up

3775
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:30,600
real good and that adds air to the hash

3776
02:30:28,649 --> 02:30:33,659
which makes it fluff up and it gives it

3777
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:35,909
a waxy texture I like wax a lot because

3778
02:30:33,659 --> 02:30:37,739
it's easy to handle and it also it seems

3779
02:30:35,909 --> 02:30:39,629
to give a big fat hit like when you take

3780
02:30:37,739 --> 02:30:41,219
a fat chunk of wax and you hit that you

3781
02:30:39,629 --> 02:30:44,279
really feel that in your lungs like a

3782
02:30:41,219 --> 02:30:46,319
kick it's not for some reason shatter

3783
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:48,000
feel smoother to me and the wax hits

3784
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:49,770
harder which sometimes I like you know

3785
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,318
sometimes you like a shotgun to the head

3786
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:54,988
you're in the mood for it there's some

3787
02:30:52,318 --> 02:30:56,698
wax that doesn't stick together and

3788
02:30:54,988 --> 02:30:59,250
that's just because of the texture of

3789
02:30:56,699 --> 02:31:00,510
the plant material or there are a lot of

3790
02:30:59,250 --> 02:31:03,059
things that can contribute to that but

3791
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:05,460
the Trumbull is basically wax that won't

3792
02:31:03,059 --> 02:31:07,049
stay together it crumble apart there's

3793
02:31:05,459 --> 02:31:09,059
nothing wrong with it it just won't

3794
02:31:07,049 --> 02:31:11,519
stick together for some reason it could

3795
02:31:09,059 --> 02:31:14,519
be moisture it could be a lot of oil in

3796
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:18,630
the in the hash itself so bets shatter

3797
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:20,039
wax crumble Earl we just call a lot of

3798
02:31:18,629 --> 02:31:22,709
the stuff that we smoked Earl

3799
02:31:20,039 --> 02:31:25,590
my name is Earl you know everything is

3800
02:31:22,709 --> 02:31:27,799
Earl nowadays there are a lot of other

3801
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:34,529
cool names for it I also talked about

3802
02:31:27,799 --> 02:31:36,358
live resin so when you're making BHO you

3803
02:31:34,529 --> 02:31:38,310
can either use nugs or trim and i

3804
02:31:36,359 --> 02:31:39,479
believe that the better you put in the

3805
02:31:38,309 --> 02:31:41,459
better quality you put in the better

3806
02:31:39,478 --> 02:31:44,010
quality you get out but some people now

3807
02:31:41,459 --> 02:31:46,379
they're taking a plant that is ready for

3808
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:48,600
harvest you cut it down you let it dry

3809
02:31:46,379 --> 02:31:51,448
for three or four hours then at that

3810
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:54,180
point they put it in the freezer and you

3811
02:31:51,449 --> 02:31:56,210
let it get nice and frozen once the

3812
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:58,529
whole plants frozen they put it into a

3813
02:31:56,209 --> 02:32:00,478
closed-loop system and we'll talk about

3814
02:31:58,529 --> 02:32:02,069
that again later they put the whole

3815
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:04,438
plant into a closed-loop system and they

3816
02:32:02,068 --> 02:32:05,818
blast it with the butane that way so

3817
02:32:04,439 --> 02:32:08,010
after it comes out of the closed-loop

3818
02:32:05,818 --> 02:32:10,198
they put it into a vacuum oven and they

3819
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:12,719
purge off all the residual butane that

3820
02:32:10,199 --> 02:32:15,449
could be left in there and the hash that

3821
02:32:12,719 --> 02:32:18,629
comes out of that is called live resin

3822
02:32:15,449 --> 02:32:20,340
and it tastes delicious some of the

3823
02:32:18,629 --> 02:32:22,828
best-tasting hash I've ever had it also

3824
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:25,799
gives me an amazing high and it seems to

3825
02:32:22,828 --> 02:32:27,328
last longer in my opinion live resin

3826
02:32:25,799 --> 02:32:29,578
would retain more of the beneficial

3827
02:32:27,328 --> 02:32:33,619
compounds then hash made from dried

3828
02:32:29,578 --> 02:32:36,119
material like dried trim or dried buds

3829
02:32:33,619 --> 02:32:38,578
but it does require a closed loop and

3830
02:32:36,119 --> 02:32:41,130
it's pretty advanced tag so live resin

3831
02:32:38,578 --> 02:32:42,238
is like next-level [ __ ] I feel like

3832
02:32:41,129 --> 02:32:43,818
now's the time when I should mention

3833
02:32:42,238 --> 02:32:46,618
that you should not ever use

3834
02:32:43,818 --> 02:32:49,590
contaminated material don't ever use

3835
02:32:46,619 --> 02:32:51,750
moldy buds or moldy trim like if you had

3836
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:55,109
powdery mildew or bud rot

3837
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:57,629
don't use that [ __ ] in your BHO if you

3838
02:32:55,109 --> 02:32:59,100
had bugs I mean if you wanted if you're

3839
02:32:57,629 --> 02:32:59,819
the only one dabbing it if you don't

3840
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:01,200
care

3841
02:32:59,819 --> 02:33:03,000
for it but if you're gonna give that to

3842
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:04,471
somebody sell that to somebody if you're

3843
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,601
gonna give that to a medical patient if

3844
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:08,879
you're gonna give that to a sick person

3845
02:33:05,601 --> 02:33:11,159
don't ever make dabs with your buggy ass

3846
02:33:08,879 --> 02:33:12,659
material that's not good for anybody all

3847
02:33:11,159 --> 02:33:14,431
right please don't do that try to think

3848
02:33:12,659 --> 02:33:17,159
about your patients think think that

3849
02:33:14,431 --> 02:33:19,230
every piece of hash you ever make or

3850
02:33:17,159 --> 02:33:20,940
have or even your buds think of all of

3851
02:33:19,229 --> 02:33:23,310
that stuff imagine what would happen if

3852
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:25,319
you gave that stuff to a sick person you

3853
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:26,340
don't know where it's going so try to be

3854
02:33:25,319 --> 02:33:28,979
conscious of that that's our

3855
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:31,710
responsibility as growers is hash makers

3856
02:33:28,979 --> 02:33:32,670
as part of a cannabis community all

3857
02:33:31,709 --> 02:33:34,020
right that's what makes us the

3858
02:33:32,670 --> 02:33:35,370
difference between the people that care

3859
02:33:34,021 --> 02:33:37,829
and the people that are just in it to

3860
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:39,301
make a buck and also be very aware of

3861
02:33:37,829 --> 02:33:40,829
everything that you're spraying on your

3862
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:42,959
plants because that's going to end up in

3863
02:33:40,829 --> 02:33:45,149
your dad if you're spraying sighs

3864
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:47,669
stomach neurotoxins onto your plants you

3865
02:33:45,149 --> 02:33:49,560
will be dabbing systemic neurotoxins in

3866
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:51,000
the future you're planning on using that

3867
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:52,860
as medicine that's what dads are

3868
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,209
intended for is medicine so don't use

3869
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:56,370
your medicine as something that's gonna

3870
02:33:54,209 --> 02:33:57,959
make you sick because that's why we're

3871
02:33:56,370 --> 02:33:59,250
using cannabis in the first place is

3872
02:33:57,959 --> 02:34:00,779
because we don't want to take the

3873
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:03,690
medicine that they're forcing upon us

3874
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:04,200
that is making us sick so fight the

3875
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:07,170
power

3876
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:09,120
help yourself fight the power all right

3877
02:34:07,170 --> 02:34:11,250
so before we can do dabs we're gonna

3878
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:13,500
have to talk about a gear list this is

3879
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:15,271
where it gets fun so let's say that you

3880
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:17,851
have acquired some dad's you went to the

3881
02:34:15,271 --> 02:34:19,230
dispensary you called your guy whatever

3882
02:34:17,851 --> 02:34:21,870
happened however it happened you got

3883
02:34:19,229 --> 02:34:23,609
some high-grade dabs you're gonna notice

3884
02:34:21,870 --> 02:34:25,920
that you need some special packaging for

3885
02:34:23,610 --> 02:34:28,170
those dabs probably came hopefully came

3886
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:31,050
wrapped in parchment paper maybe it came

3887
02:34:28,170 --> 02:34:33,030
in a little silicone package if you're

3888
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:34,800
using those silicone packages I only

3889
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:37,230
recommend oil slick oil slick is

3890
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:39,750
platinum cured silicone I recommend you

3891
02:34:37,229 --> 02:34:42,270
go to oil slick pad comm and read about

3892
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:44,670
the process of platinum curing their

3893
02:34:42,271 --> 02:34:46,801
products because it's very important so

3894
02:34:44,670 --> 02:34:48,271
once you get home get those dabs get it

3895
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:49,949
out of that parchment paper get it out

3896
02:34:48,271 --> 02:34:52,409
of whatever they they sold it to you in

3897
02:34:49,950 --> 02:34:54,210
and go on oil slick pad comm and get

3898
02:34:52,409 --> 02:34:56,670
yourself a little slick stack or a slick

3899
02:34:54,209 --> 02:34:58,199
ball or a slick ball mini get a couple

3900
02:34:56,670 --> 02:35:00,120
of them then fill all those up with

3901
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:01,590
different types of dabs so now you got a

3902
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:03,420
little dab collection and a safe

3903
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:05,431
container to keep it in the cool thing

3904
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:07,379
about those slick stacks is up your

3905
02:35:05,431 --> 02:35:08,670
hatch won't stick to those you won't get

3906
02:35:07,379 --> 02:35:10,319
ripped off you always feel like if you

3907
02:35:08,670 --> 02:35:11,670
put it in plastic or glass you're gonna

3908
02:35:10,319 --> 02:35:12,799
get ripped off and don't go trying to

3909
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:14,180
scrape those last

3910
02:35:12,799 --> 02:35:16,309
dad's off the plastic because you're

3911
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:18,590
gonna end up dabbing plastic it's gonna

3912
02:35:16,309 --> 02:35:20,059
taste like [ __ ] you're gonna choke and

3913
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:22,068
that's gonna suck you're not gonna have

3914
02:35:20,059 --> 02:35:23,689
a good time all right so you got

3915
02:35:22,068 --> 02:35:26,478
yourself a slick stack you got your hash

3916
02:35:23,689 --> 02:35:28,280
stored up nice and safely now you were

3917
02:35:26,478 --> 02:35:29,799
probably gonna notice that that hash is

3918
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:32,090
real sticky kind of hard to handle

3919
02:35:29,799 --> 02:35:34,759
you're gonna need to get some dad tools

3920
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:37,309
or maybe a highly-educated dabber or

3921
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:40,040
maybe a highly-educated dabber with a

3922
02:35:37,309 --> 02:35:41,420
carb cap on it it'll stand upright for

3923
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:43,580
you but you need something to stick in

3924
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:44,898
there to handle those dabs for you

3925
02:35:43,579 --> 02:35:46,280
because it's gonna stick to your fingers

3926
02:35:44,898 --> 02:35:48,349
if your fingers are warm you got to get

3927
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:50,989
those dabs onto the under the tip of a

3928
02:35:48,350 --> 02:35:52,760
dabber somehow and then that dabber is

3929
02:35:50,989 --> 02:35:55,219
actually gonna be gonna be the key to

3930
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:56,930
your success here pretty soon and also

3931
02:35:55,219 --> 02:35:58,489
be careful the first time you go dab it

3932
02:35:56,930 --> 02:35:59,780
into a container of shatter you're gonna

3933
02:35:58,489 --> 02:36:01,549
stick your dabber right into that

3934
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:03,439
container and I've said it before uh

3935
02:36:01,549 --> 02:36:05,509
soon as you push down into that

3936
02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:07,100
container a shatter a little piece of

3937
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:08,659
that shatter is gonna go flying off into

3938
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:09,500
nowhere and you're never gonna find it

3939
02:36:08,659 --> 02:36:13,159
you're gonna be pissed

3940
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:14,600
so don't lose your first dab be gentle

3941
02:36:13,159 --> 02:36:15,739
maybe stick your thumb in there warm it

3942
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:17,180
up with your thumb rub it with your

3943
02:36:15,739 --> 02:36:19,489
thumb a little bit that'll make the hash

3944
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:20,870
a little softer it'll be more pliable

3945
02:36:19,489 --> 02:36:23,270
then you'll be able to get a dab off of

3946
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:24,979
it without wasting your first dab if you

3947
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:26,359
do a launch one off into the middle of

3948
02:36:24,978 --> 02:36:28,369
nowhere we always say that's one for the

3949
02:36:26,359 --> 02:36:30,409
dead homies like I used to pour out of

3950
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:31,970
40 no you just flick a dab off into the

3951
02:36:30,409 --> 02:36:33,530
middle of nowhere I'd be thankful that

3952
02:36:31,969 --> 02:36:36,438
it didn't go into your eye because when

3953
02:36:33,530 --> 02:36:38,090
it does it [ __ ] burns trust me all

3954
02:36:36,439 --> 02:36:39,739
right so now you've got your uh dabs you

3955
02:36:38,090 --> 02:36:41,719
got yourself some shatter or some SAP

3956
02:36:39,739 --> 02:36:44,389
you know how to get it out of container

3957
02:36:41,719 --> 02:36:46,639
without wasting it it's time to I figure

3958
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:47,809
out a little bit more of this gear the

3959
02:36:46,639 --> 02:36:51,909
most important thing you're gonna need

3960
02:36:47,809 --> 02:36:54,680
is a rig and a nail a rig is basically

3961
02:36:51,909 --> 02:36:55,189
everybody tries to call it a bong if

3962
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:56,720
you're smoking

3963
02:36:55,189 --> 02:36:59,780
Earl threw it that's your rig it's an

3964
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:01,309
oil rig so needle rig I prefer a small

3965
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:02,899
rig we'll talk about that later one of

3966
02:37:01,309 --> 02:37:05,420
the Twitter questions is why do I use

3967
02:37:02,898 --> 02:37:07,599
such a small rig I'll explain that to

3968
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:10,219
you in the future you also need a nail

3969
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:11,899
nails are either made of well they're

3970
02:37:10,219 --> 02:37:14,148
made of titanium or my favorite there's

3971
02:37:11,898 --> 02:37:17,510
also ceramic there's glass and there's

3972
02:37:14,148 --> 02:37:19,010
quartz I'm not a fan of the glass they

3973
02:37:17,510 --> 02:37:21,350
never seem to taste right to me the

3974
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:23,420
quartz is awesome however I break [ __ ]

3975
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:24,149
which is also why I don't use the

3976
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:28,351
ceramic

3977
02:37:24,149 --> 02:37:30,390
I prefer the titanium if I'm gonna buy a

3978
02:37:28,351 --> 02:37:32,011
nail I only buy a highly-educated nail

3979
02:37:30,390 --> 02:37:34,949
to tell you the truth tonight I've been

3980
02:37:32,011 --> 02:37:38,479
dabbing off of a highly-educated duality

3981
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:40,829
nail shadow two tasks thanks a lot bro

3982
02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:43,619
so I know I say this a lot but really

3983
02:37:40,829 --> 02:37:45,720
invest in your nail if you have a budget

3984
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:47,011
spend the smaller portion on your rig

3985
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,119
and the higher portion on your nail

3986
02:37:47,011 --> 02:37:50,431
because you're gonna be heating that

3987
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:51,811
sucker up to a really high temperature

3988
02:37:50,431 --> 02:37:53,489
between four and six hundred degrees

3989
02:37:51,810 --> 02:37:55,500
maybe hot or depending on how crazy you

3990
02:37:53,489 --> 02:37:56,761
are with torch but you're gonna be

3991
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:58,021
heating that up and then you're dropping

3992
02:37:56,761 --> 02:38:00,540
your medicine on to that and you're

3993
02:37:58,021 --> 02:38:02,610
smoking it off of that you're basically

3994
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:04,740
inhaling whatever is in or on that nail

3995
02:38:02,610 --> 02:38:06,960
if you've got some funky [ __ ] from China

3996
02:38:04,739 --> 02:38:08,130
they don't care about you our friends

3997
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:10,140
here at America that are making good

3998
02:38:08,130 --> 02:38:12,930
products I'll recommend hive and I'll

3999
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:16,409
also recommend highly educated they make

4000
02:38:12,931 --> 02:38:18,091
good stuff the Halen honey hole awesome

4001
02:38:16,409 --> 02:38:20,489
that's good [ __ ] right there those are

4002
02:38:18,091 --> 02:38:22,860
three products you got a quartz you got

4003
02:38:20,489 --> 02:38:25,860
a titanium and you got your ceramic so

4004
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:28,200
the hive Halen honey hole and the

4005
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:30,690
anything from highly educated highly

4006
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:32,909
educated titanium product has got my

4007
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:35,011
endorsement all day long so get yourself

4008
02:38:32,909 --> 02:38:37,050
a good nail get a rig I like a little

4009
02:38:35,011 --> 02:38:39,360
tiny break I said that before now you're

4010
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:42,239
gonna need a dabber and a torch those

4011
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:44,280
are the first few things you need be

4012
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:45,420
careful with the torch everybody gets

4013
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:47,250
scared of you when you pull out a

4014
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:49,470
blowtorch be careful where you do that I

4015
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:51,120
need a little dab torch

4016
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:52,409
I like the vector torch they're a little

4017
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:53,400
more expensive but they do have a

4018
02:38:52,409 --> 02:38:55,771
lifetime guarantee

4019
02:38:53,399 --> 02:38:57,449
I like to wrap them up in stickers I've

4020
02:38:55,771 --> 02:39:00,210
got a custom torch with the Chewbacca on

4021
02:38:57,450 --> 02:39:02,641
it it was actually a creme brulee torch

4022
02:39:00,209 --> 02:39:04,590
they came from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond that my

4023
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:06,479
buddy customized for me so if you're not

4024
02:39:04,591 --> 02:39:09,091
a big spender go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond he

4025
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:11,489
can get the $30 creme brulee torch it

4026
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:14,550
works just as well as the vector but it

4027
02:39:11,489 --> 02:39:15,989
doesn't have a lifetime guarantee so now

4028
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:17,520
you got your rig you got your nail you

4029
02:39:15,989 --> 02:39:21,390
got a torch you needed a bird a dabber

4030
02:39:17,521 --> 02:39:23,011
is basically it's a poker that you use

4031
02:39:21,390 --> 02:39:25,289
to drop your dad you just put a little

4032
02:39:23,011 --> 02:39:27,149
dab on the end of it just a little tiny

4033
02:39:25,290 --> 02:39:29,910
dab will talk about dab size in the

4034
02:39:27,149 --> 02:39:31,369
future also so you just take a little

4035
02:39:29,909 --> 02:39:33,959
dab you put it on the end of your dabber

4036
02:39:31,370 --> 02:39:35,940
you heat up your nail with your torch

4037
02:39:33,959 --> 02:39:37,470
and you don't have to go [ __ ]

4038
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:37,899
destroying this thing with heat you just

4039
02:39:37,470 --> 02:39:40,390
need it

4040
02:39:37,899 --> 02:39:41,979
enough if you put your hand over it you

4041
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:43,750
just barely want to feel your skin

4042
02:39:41,979 --> 02:39:45,100
tighten up and get a little hot you

4043
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:46,239
don't want to burn you don't want to

4044
02:39:45,101 --> 02:39:47,980
touch it but you want to like hold your

4045
02:39:46,239 --> 02:39:50,351
hand over and feel the heat you're just

4046
02:39:47,979 --> 02:39:52,779
trying to melt this hash so if you're

4047
02:39:50,351 --> 02:39:54,971
using a rig that has a dome on it you

4048
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:56,620
put the dome over the nail now and then

4049
02:39:54,970 --> 02:39:58,600
you put the hash inside of there

4050
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:59,860
directly onto the nail if you've got a

4051
02:39:58,601 --> 02:40:01,450
domeless nail

4052
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:04,301
don't drop it right down the hole put it

4053
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:06,579
in the area around the hole and if

4054
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:08,500
you've got a carb cap put the carb cap

4055
02:40:06,579 --> 02:40:10,329
over it and just inhale as soon as you

4056
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:13,329
touched that and your gonna get a nice

4057
02:40:10,329 --> 02:40:14,860
fat dab if you did it right all right so

4058
02:40:13,329 --> 02:40:16,899
now we're familiar with the rig the nail

4059
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:18,431
and the torch and the dabber I talked

4060
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:21,039
about a carb cap I'll explain that a

4061
02:40:18,431 --> 02:40:24,069
little bit later you're also probably

4062
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:26,471
gonna need like an oil slick pad or

4063
02:40:24,069 --> 02:40:30,360
possibly a rig rag or some sort of dab

4064
02:40:26,470 --> 02:40:32,800
pad you're gonna have some residual

4065
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:35,860
leftover tabs on your tab or after a lot

4066
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:37,630
of dabbing dad pad a 7/10 dab pad is a

4067
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:40,420
good place to wipe that on an oil slick

4068
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:41,920
slick pad or a slab pad is also an

4069
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:44,380
excellent place for that a slide pads

4070
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:48,610
also a good idea keeps your keep your

4071
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:50,260
rigs safe from the table is also handy

4072
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:51,909
but it's not as classy as the other two

4073
02:40:50,261 --> 02:40:55,329
just something to wipe that excess

4074
02:40:51,909 --> 02:40:57,459
damage off of also you may be you may

4075
02:40:55,329 --> 02:40:59,440
see the evening all coming out somewhere

4076
02:40:57,459 --> 02:41:01,449
the emails the electric nail let's talk

4077
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:02,860
about that there are a bunch of

4078
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:04,750
different brands available lately but

4079
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:07,870
most of them do the same thing the email

4080
02:41:04,750 --> 02:41:09,659
is basically the electric nail eye plugs

4081
02:41:07,870 --> 02:41:12,579
into the wall it's got a little box and

4082
02:41:09,659 --> 02:41:14,289
most of them look like a small like a

4083
02:41:12,579 --> 02:41:16,450
piece of musical gear a small amplifier

4084
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:18,221
or something you know like it looks just

4085
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:19,601
like my little focus right audio

4086
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:21,789
interface here is about what most of

4087
02:41:19,601 --> 02:41:23,319
them look like little box with a couple

4088
02:41:21,790 --> 02:41:25,660
switches on it and then a cord coming

4089
02:41:23,319 --> 02:41:26,979
out of it and the cord attaches to a

4090
02:41:25,659 --> 02:41:31,329
nail most people are using the

4091
02:41:26,979 --> 02:41:33,850
highly-educated infinity nail so you put

4092
02:41:31,329 --> 02:41:35,950
this heat element onto your nail and

4093
02:41:33,851 --> 02:41:37,301
that sits on the rig and it always stays

4094
02:41:35,950 --> 02:41:39,641
hot at the perfect temperature so you

4095
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:41,859
could drop that down to a nice low temp

4096
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:43,569
you can set your dab on there then you

4097
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:44,950
throw the carpet the carb cap up on top

4098
02:41:43,569 --> 02:41:46,511
of that and you let it sit for just half

4099
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:48,551
a second and then you start dabbing it

4100
02:41:46,511 --> 02:41:51,101
and you really get a nice flavored

4101
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:54,100
perfect heat dad

4102
02:41:51,101 --> 02:41:55,659
I think it's great it does make me over

4103
02:41:54,101 --> 02:41:56,829
dab a little bit honestly when I have it

4104
02:41:55,659 --> 02:41:58,659
sitting on the table I tend to take

4105
02:41:56,829 --> 02:42:01,030
extra dabs because I don't have to sit

4106
02:41:58,659 --> 02:42:02,380
there and heat the nail but when you're

4107
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:03,730
having a social gathering and there are

4108
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:05,439
a lot of dabs going around it's really

4109
02:42:03,729 --> 02:42:06,579
helpful because I find the torch to be

4110
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:08,290
slightly abrasive when there's

4111
02:42:06,579 --> 02:42:11,261
conversation going on that's just my

4112
02:42:08,290 --> 02:42:14,051
opinion so when you're balling get

4113
02:42:11,261 --> 02:42:16,149
yourself an email it's worth the cost in

4114
02:42:14,050 --> 02:42:19,829
butane alone you'll save so much butane

4115
02:42:16,149 --> 02:42:23,440
from heating up the rig a lot of people

4116
02:42:19,829 --> 02:42:25,390
talk about hitting a vape pen I'm gonna

4117
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:26,440
piss a lot of people off here a pen hit

4118
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:29,649
is not a dab

4119
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:30,940
that's not dabbing that's cool for if

4120
02:42:29,649 --> 02:42:33,011
you're at the movie theater or maybe

4121
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:37,360
it's cool for your girlfriend but just

4122
02:42:33,011 --> 02:42:38,771
get a break and take a DAB all right so

4123
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:40,601
we should have a basic understanding of

4124
02:42:38,771 --> 02:42:42,250
what dabs are we should know what the

4125
02:42:40,601 --> 02:42:44,560
gear is should know how to handle your

4126
02:42:42,250 --> 02:42:46,601
dabs by now seems like there's only one

4127
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:49,091
thing left to do let's take a fat dab

4128
02:42:46,601 --> 02:42:51,400
together but put a nice sticky dab of

4129
02:42:49,091 --> 02:42:54,101
some shatter under this highly-educated

4130
02:42:51,399 --> 02:42:56,709
carb cap with the dabber on it I like

4131
02:42:54,101 --> 02:43:00,670
the flat tip the best I've learned and

4132
02:42:56,709 --> 02:43:02,169
I'm gonna grab my torch here nail this

4133
02:43:00,670 --> 02:43:04,300
nail I usually have to give it about a

4134
02:43:02,170 --> 02:43:06,670
10 or 12 count I'm gonna hold it away

4135
02:43:04,300 --> 02:43:10,329
from the microphone I usually go one two

4136
02:43:06,670 --> 02:43:14,351
three four I'm sure you guys can count

4137
02:43:10,329 --> 02:43:16,931
to 12 right so it should be getting

4138
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:18,460
pretty close all right

4139
02:43:16,931 --> 02:43:19,750
I think it's me about there I can tell

4140
02:43:18,459 --> 02:43:20,770
that it's hot enough by looking at it I

4141
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:23,261
can see that it's slightly getting

4142
02:43:20,771 --> 02:43:25,631
orange let it cool for just a brief

4143
02:43:23,261 --> 02:43:29,250
moment here now there's where I take a

4144
02:43:25,630 --> 02:43:29,250
nap take a dab with me guys please do

4145
02:43:45,879 --> 02:43:49,909
all right now I'm gonna call for a

4146
02:43:47,899 --> 02:43:51,440
couple of seconds then we'll come back

4147
02:43:49,909 --> 02:43:53,299
and answer a couple of quick Twitter

4148
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:55,130
questions hey don't be afraid to cough

4149
02:43:53,299 --> 02:43:57,049
and turn red and sweat and [ __ ] after

4150
02:43:55,129 --> 02:43:58,728
your first couple of dabs we expect that

4151
02:43:57,049 --> 02:44:00,019
of you if you're not choking and

4152
02:43:58,728 --> 02:44:01,760
coughing you're not taking big enough

4153
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:02,300
dabs give me a minute to get my [ __ ]

4154
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:04,159
together

4155
02:44:02,299 --> 02:44:13,459
welcome back and work on these Twitter

4156
02:44:04,159 --> 02:44:16,520
questions I hope everybody survived

4157
02:44:13,459 --> 02:44:18,379
their dabs all right so let's get to

4158
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:19,700
these Twitter questions I said earlier

4159
02:44:18,379 --> 02:44:21,769
that I was gonna answer the question why

4160
02:44:19,700 --> 02:44:24,200
do I use such a small rig somebody saw

4161
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:27,140
me post an Instagram little clip and I

4162
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:30,140
was using a little tiny mad rob rig I

4163
02:44:27,139 --> 02:44:31,760
like a little tiny rig the purpose of a

4164
02:44:30,139 --> 02:44:33,469
large bong is so that you could fill it

4165
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:34,909
up with smoke and then pull the carb and

4166
02:44:33,469 --> 02:44:37,069
then you get all that smoke it wants

4167
02:44:34,909 --> 02:44:39,559
with the dab you're just taking a little

4168
02:44:37,069 --> 02:44:41,059
tiny dab and you don't really want to

4169
02:44:39,559 --> 02:44:42,500
fill it with smoke you just want to get

4170
02:44:41,059 --> 02:44:45,350
that smoke to your head so a little rake

4171
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:47,750
takes less sucking and less air if I had

4172
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:49,850
a great big rig a great big bong I'd

4173
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:51,350
have to suck all that air through to try

4174
02:44:49,850 --> 02:44:53,450
to get that dad through it it just feels

4175
02:44:51,350 --> 02:44:54,860
like I'm sucking a lot of air because

4176
02:44:53,450 --> 02:44:56,329
you can't fill it up with smoke you can

4177
02:44:54,860 --> 02:44:57,920
only get so much dad I mean you're not

4178
02:44:56,329 --> 02:45:00,159
gonna carve it cuz you got the it's hot

4179
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:02,450
it's hot as [ __ ] the nail is really hot

4180
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:04,430
so that's why I use a small rig cuz I

4181
02:45:02,450 --> 02:45:07,460
don't want to smoke air I want to smoke

4182
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:09,139
a phat dab right to my face I want just

4183
02:45:07,459 --> 02:45:10,909
enough water to cool it down I don't

4184
02:45:09,139 --> 02:45:14,059
need a whole lot of special percolation

4185
02:45:10,909 --> 02:45:15,469
just a basic perk is cool with me cuz I

4186
02:45:14,059 --> 02:45:17,719
just need that to cool it I'm not trying

4187
02:45:15,469 --> 02:45:19,219
to get really filtered like you do with

4188
02:45:17,719 --> 02:45:21,049
your cannabis I don't want to over

4189
02:45:19,219 --> 02:45:22,969
filter it I want to cool it down punch

4190
02:45:21,049 --> 02:45:26,090
it right to my head so that's why I use

4191
02:45:22,969 --> 02:45:29,449
a small rig the other question was about

4192
02:45:26,090 --> 02:45:32,210
dab size and how much hash my smoking

4193
02:45:29,450 --> 02:45:34,130
not me myself how much hash are people

4194
02:45:32,209 --> 02:45:36,978
smoking in a dab how much is what's a

4195
02:45:34,129 --> 02:45:40,309
serving size or a dose I'd start off

4196
02:45:36,978 --> 02:45:42,409
with like about a sesame seed size dab

4197
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:44,239
maybe it's a piece of a relic a piece of

4198
02:45:42,409 --> 02:45:47,829
rice I think a piece of rice it's

4199
02:45:44,239 --> 02:45:51,648
probably about point zero two of a gram

4200
02:45:47,829 --> 02:45:53,959
so the average medical patient or the

4201
02:45:51,648 --> 02:45:57,079
average dab consumer is gonna take about

4202
02:45:53,959 --> 02:46:00,068
a point zero to two maybe like a point

4203
02:45:57,079 --> 02:46:05,420
one would be kind of a larger dab but

4204
02:46:00,068 --> 02:46:07,430
some people take up to 0.2 or 0.25 you

4205
02:46:05,420 --> 02:46:09,260
know just depends on what you're getting

4206
02:46:07,430 --> 02:46:13,309
into and how big you like to do I did a

4207
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:16,159
little bit of math there are 28 grams in

4208
02:46:13,309 --> 02:46:20,228
an ounce and if you get a 20% return

4209
02:46:16,159 --> 02:46:23,209
that turns into 5.6 grams of hash

4210
02:46:20,228 --> 02:46:25,340
basically smoking a point to dab is the

4211
02:46:23,209 --> 02:46:29,299
equivalent of smoking one gram of herb

4212
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:32,420
in one hit by yourself so you can go

4213
02:46:29,299 --> 02:46:33,619
anywhere from point two point zero 2 all

4214
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:35,478
the way up to point two with your dad's

4215
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:37,939
I've done a grand before but I wouldn't

4216
02:46:35,478 --> 02:46:39,619
recommend it don't do that my lungs are

4217
02:46:37,939 --> 02:46:41,300
still [ __ ] up from it they never will

4218
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:43,609
be the same I don't think from taking

4219
02:46:41,299 --> 02:46:45,049
too large of a dab several times not

4220
02:46:43,609 --> 02:46:49,399
just once but I didn't over and over

4221
02:46:45,049 --> 02:46:51,139
again I think I hurt myself another

4222
02:46:49,398 --> 02:46:52,909
thing to think about is it takes a lot

4223
02:46:51,139 --> 02:46:54,829
more heat to heat up a big fat dab than

4224
02:46:52,909 --> 02:46:56,539
it does to heat up a little dab so just

4225
02:46:54,829 --> 02:46:58,398
take a bunch of little dabs and it

4226
02:46:56,540 --> 02:47:00,100
requires a little bit less heat and your

4227
02:46:58,398 --> 02:47:02,629
lungs don't get all that heat in there

4228
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:04,040
yeah I say that but then I look over at

4229
02:47:02,629 --> 02:47:05,779
my dabber and I've got a big gigantic

4230
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:07,189
dad sitting there waiting for me I'm

4231
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:08,780
gonna take a big dab I'll answer one

4232
02:47:07,189 --> 02:47:10,370
more Twitter question they were gonna

4233
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:13,939
give thanks and start wrapping up the

4234
02:47:10,370 --> 02:47:16,550
show all right I hope you guys enjoyed

4235
02:47:13,939 --> 02:47:18,620
that dab I sure did my last question

4236
02:47:16,549 --> 02:47:22,279
from Twitter is what is with this 7 10

4237
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:24,140
what a 710 mean well 710 is nice and

4238
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:26,630
simple if you turn the number 710 upside

4239
02:47:24,139 --> 02:47:29,989
down spells the word oil if you've been

4240
02:47:26,629 --> 02:47:31,909
listening oil is all about the dabs in

4241
02:47:29,989 --> 02:47:33,619
one of my earlier episodes I mentioned

4242
02:47:31,909 --> 02:47:37,129
that if somebody sent me a tweet with

4243
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:38,600
who coined the phrase 710 that I would

4244
02:47:37,129 --> 02:47:40,579
send them some stickers as a prize

4245
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:42,620
somebody actually tweeted me the correct

4246
02:47:40,579 --> 02:47:44,719
answer maybe it was on Instagram but you

4247
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:46,010
sent the correct answer you just need to

4248
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:48,409
give me your mailing address so that I

4249
02:47:46,010 --> 02:47:50,210
can send you those stickers the correct

4250
02:47:48,409 --> 02:47:51,869
answer was tasks Rock and the guys from

4251
02:47:50,209 --> 02:47:53,969
health stone

4252
02:47:51,870 --> 02:47:55,579
so now we're gonna give thanks and then

4253
02:47:53,969 --> 02:47:57,688
we're gonna wrap up the show here we go

4254
02:47:55,579 --> 02:48:00,629
this episode we're gonna give thanks to

4255
02:47:57,689 --> 02:48:02,189
my friend Big D Daniel Desai I don't

4256
02:48:00,629 --> 02:48:03,539
think the hash movement and the 7:10

4257
02:48:02,189 --> 02:48:06,030
community could be where it is today

4258
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:08,040
without the help of Big D Big D was the

4259
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:09,540
founder of top shelf extracts he's a

4260
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:11,430
cannabis Cup winner

4261
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:14,460
Big D actually gave me my very first

4262
02:48:11,430 --> 02:48:16,170
real dab at the Cannabis Cup at the

4263
02:48:14,459 --> 02:48:18,929
Broadway wellness booth when we had the

4264
02:48:16,170 --> 02:48:21,510
first cup here in Denver at the expo so

4265
02:48:18,930 --> 02:48:22,889
I wouldn't be the dabber I am today I

4266
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:24,750
wouldn't be able to give you this info

4267
02:48:22,889 --> 02:48:27,719
today without the inspiration and the

4268
02:48:24,750 --> 02:48:30,059
help from Big B Big D is the host of the

4269
02:48:27,719 --> 02:48:31,349
secret cup the secret cup is a secret so

4270
02:48:30,059 --> 02:48:33,840
I'm not gonna tell you too much about it

4271
02:48:31,350 --> 02:48:37,020
but it is a dab competition they host

4272
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:38,280
regional competitions they have a Finals

4273

and then they also have the national

4274
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:43,560
championships as a hash competition bush

4275
02:48:40,950 --> 02:48:45,329
it's a secret that's going on right now

4276
02:48:43,559 --> 02:48:47,369
Big D's in California working his ass

4277

thanks much love one year four seven ten

4279
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:55,649
Big D hosted an event called the dads of

4280
02:48:52,770 --> 02:48:57,149
Denver he had a bunch of raffle items to

4281
02:48:55,648 --> 02:48:58,769
give away and he sold raffle tickets

4282
02:48:57,148 --> 02:49:00,148
they threw a big fat show at the

4283
02:48:58,770 --> 02:49:01,979
oriental theater where we were able to

4284
02:49:00,148 --> 02:49:03,809
dab out and have a real community event

4285
02:49:01,978 --> 02:49:05,429
there were a bunch of people there that

4286
02:49:03,809 --> 02:49:08,039
night and there was also a huge raffle

4287
02:49:05,430 --> 02:49:09,780
and Big D donated all the proceeds to a

4288
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:12,180
local care center so that they could buy

4289
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:13,770
a van to get all of the disabled folks

4290
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:15,200
to their doctor's appointments to let

4291
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:17,430
make their lives a little bit easier

4292
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:19,829
that's just one example of the awesome

4293
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:21,569
