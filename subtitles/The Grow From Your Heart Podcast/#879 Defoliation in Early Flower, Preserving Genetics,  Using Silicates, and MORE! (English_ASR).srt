420 sale at erirect.com. Thank you. The

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,840

dgccup.com for all the information. Now,

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,120
let's work our way into the question and

71
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
answer portion of today's podcast. I

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
don't know if you can hear it in my

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,318
throat and in my voice. I don't want to

74
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,119
talk about it too much because if you

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,039
didn't notice, it's not a big deal. But

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
got a little bit of a sinus head cold

77
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,039
throat thing going on here. This is the

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,360
episode I'm recording after the 420

79
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,919
weekend. Humble brag here. I got to go

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,959
see Sublime. Uh yeah, that's right, bro.

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,878
Sublime with Bradley's son, Jacob. Uh

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,878
doing the front job there. I got to go

83
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,158
see Sublime at a small club in Denver.

84
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,399
Mike and I got to go. It was really

85
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,120
random. Sublime was scheduled to do a

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,280
show here at Red Rocks on 4:18, I

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,039
believe, and the weather uh [ __ ] that

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,439
all up. So, they postponed the show for

89
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,199
three or four days. Sublime was in town.

90
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,359
They were bored. They wanted to play.

91
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,759
They threw a kind of a surprise show at

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
a

93
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,039
smaller Once again, excuse all that.

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
They threw a a show at a smaller venue

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,359
in Denver. And uh I got to go see

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Sublime at a small show, a small club in

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Denver with Mike. That was on 419.

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,719
That's when all of this uh throat and

99
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,479
sinus chaos began. We smoked two joints

100
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,479
in the morning. We smoked two joints at

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,878
night. We smoked two joints in the

102
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,199
afternoon. Uh we still didn't feel all

103
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,878
right. So there was two or more uh maybe

104
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,639
four or six more joints. There was times

105
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,878
of peace and times of war. So we smoked

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,719
then as well. Uh we smoked two joints

107
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,598
before we smoked two joints. And then we

108
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,080
[ __ ] dabbed a little bit more. So uh

109
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,399
my whole my smoking section for my whole

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
body, it notices it and it needs a day

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
off from smoking. So, I think tomorrow

112
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,399
we're going to not smoke. We're going to

113
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,919
take a little break, drink a lot of

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
water, get some juice and vitamins in

115
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,680
me, get these problems fixed. That was

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
disgusting. I kind of apologize for

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
doing that. But, uh, where what was I

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
even [ __ ] saying, dude? I don't even

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
know what I was rambling about anymore.

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,720
Um, excuse me for all this stuff in The

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,160
Voices where I think I was headed. We

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,919
got to see Sublime, dude. This is the

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
episode after 420 is where I think I was

124
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,000
going. Uh, we got to see Sublime, then

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
it was 420. Uh, then it was Earth Day

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
after that. Oh, no. Then it was

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
groundation day. If you're a Rastafari,

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
uh, you understand about groundation

129
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,959
day. I'm not going to teach you about

130
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,959
that today. So, we had Sublime on 419.

131
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,039
Then we had 420. Then we had groundation

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,879
day. Then the next day was Earth Day.

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,000
So, I went to an Earth Day celebration

134
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,918
there. Um, my my sinuses and my my whole

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,879
respiratory thing. It needs a day off.

136
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,159
Happy 420 everybody. But, holy [ __ ] we

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,199
went hard this year. I don't know what

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
the [ __ ] I was saying. I don't know

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
where I was. We're going to do the

140
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,879
question and answer portion part of the

141
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,319
podcast. Now, I've got a website. That

142
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,759
website, most of you know by now is

143
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,439
urgeetics.com. That is my main website.

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
If you go to that website, there are a

145
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,360
lot of cool places to click around.

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,800
Click around, find some cool [ __ ] Uh

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
you just got to poke around. If you

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,720
scroll uh if you scroll to the top,

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
there's a row of tabs. One of those tabs

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,960
does say uh grow help or grow questions.

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
If you click on that tab, guess what?

152
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,439
You get the option to send me a grow

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,918
question. If I read your grow question

154
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,399
here on the podcast, I will send you a

155
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,120
coupon code for a free pack of seeds off

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,038
of my vending website, ire redirect.com.

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,038
That's right. There's two websites. Lots

158
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,719
of reasons for that. But today's first

159
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,199
question that came off of the growhelp

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
tab at ire redirect.com came from our

161
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,360
friend who wants to be called Krispy.

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
What up Krispy? Uh I have never related

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,319
more with the name. I feel crispy today.

164
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,359
Not complaining, but wow. Feel crispy.

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,879
We're gonna make a quick show. We're

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
gonna make it sound good. Krispy's

167
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,038
question is a two-part question. The

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
first part I answered on a recent

169
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,399
episode. The second part, we're going to

170
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,680
touch on this and I'm going to get a few

171
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,279
questions out pretty quickly today.

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
We're going to not try to dwell on these

173
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,359
questions too long. Let's get into it. I

174
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,120
know guys, I'm rambly today. Uh you're

175
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
welcome. The question goes, "What up,

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
Rosta Jeff? Two questions. Uh do you

177
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,758
count week one of flower as soon as you

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
flip?" Yes, we've covered this. Uh just

179
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
in case you weren't listening, uh this

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,439
person is asking, "When is day one of

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,680
flower?" uh we're switching the light

182
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:34,399
from 1212 or from 186 or 195 or 24 going

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,478
to flip it to 1212. The day you do that,

184
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,399
that is day one of flower. That is day

185
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
one. The day you change the timer, uh

186
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,839
the first night that those plants get a

187
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,079
short night or a long night, a short

188
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,638
day, that is your first day of flower.

189
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,839
We've covered that. Day one is day one.

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:54,160
The second part, what is your opinion on

191
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,959
defoliation? My answer is yes, do that.

192
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,520
do that with strategy. I defoliate

193
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,959
semiheavily in my opinion. Honestly,

194
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,879
I've been a little bit lazy. I've been

195
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,879
defoliating medium. I should go much

196
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,319
harder, but it is time consuming and

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,319
there's a couple plants in the back my

198
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,000
big ass can't really get to right now to

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,120
defoliate them the way I would like. So,

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
they're a little bit furry. It looks

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,879
like a 70s bush in there. I like to

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
defoliate. I recommend in a commercial

203
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,319
environment, I defoliate quite heavily.

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,840
Um, don't hit one plant and strip it at

205
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,080
a level 10 and then move to the next

206
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,079
plant and strip it. Go in a spiral

207
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,918
around the entire grow. Do this plant at

208
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,159
a level two. This plant at a level two,

209
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,079
this plant level two. Get them all at a

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
level two. Then go back through and do

211
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,120
them all to a level four, level five.

212
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,519
Strip them pretty good. As much as

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,598
you're comfortable with. Any leaf with a

214
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,758
big purple pedial comes right off. Any

215
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,918
leaf I can strip off easily comes right

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
off. Any leaf blocking light from

217
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,439
getting to a lower bud site probably

218
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
comes right off. I don't need that much

219
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,839
blockage, that much shade in there. So,

220
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
I do a lot of defoliation. The reason

221
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,079
I'm telling you to do it in a rotation

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
is because if you, and this is going to

223
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,120
vary on the size of your room, the

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
amount of plants, keep in mind I have a

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,038
commercial cultivation background, so I

226
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
think on a larger scale sometimes, but

227
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,639
if you go and you strip row one down and

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,960
rows three and four are still looking

229
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,680
like a 70s bush, you're going to have a

230
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,519
huge fluctuation in humidity levels in

231
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
that room. This plant is going to have

232
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,959
this section is going to be a lot more

233
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,720
damp, a lot more humid in the room. The

234
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,399
VPD is going to be funky. Over here,

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
it's going to be drier. you're going to

236
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,598
have different effects on the plant. If

237
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,959
you've got sensors hanging in the room,

238
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,639
now your equipment's going to be coming

239
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,159
off and going on all random. It's not

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
sure what's happening because you've

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
created microclimates. You need more

242
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,038
fans. You need to adjust things. Still

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
going to be a little bit of a struggle.

244
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,759
So, I do defoliate and I do it heavily,

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
but I do it in a rotation and I do it

246
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,759
with strategy. I will lollipop the

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,918
bottoms of the plants. Clean them up

248
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,600
depending on the room, the light.

249
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,199
There's a lot of [ __ ] factors in

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
there. Clean up the bottoms. Do some

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
lollipopping. then do some pruning of

252
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,958
those sticks. Um, I'll clean off the

253
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,479
bottom, shave the legs, then I'll go and

254
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,159
start at the top and I'll do a heavy

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
defoliation and try to get that light

256
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,958
all the way through the canopy, uh, into

257
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,278
all of those buds. So, uh, what's your

258
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,359
opinion of defoliation? Quick answer,

259
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,439
[ __ ] do it. Second answer, do it with

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
strategy. Uh, work your way around the

261
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
room. Don't hit one plant and then leave

262
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,959
the rest real furry. Try to work with

263
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,519
some strategy. That is my advice.

264
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,278
Anything with a big pedial, take it off.

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
Uh these plants can take a lot of

266
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,039
defoliation. I will do it uh right at

267
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,919
the start of flower. I'll do it on day

268
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:27,439
one, day 21, uh sometimes day 42, and

269
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,879
then keep going because now you're just

270
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
getting ready to harvest anyway. And why

271
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,320
not start pulling off leaves because we

272
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,000
don't need all those [ __ ] leaves

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
there for harvest. Uh there are a lot of

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,679
benefits to taking off these leaves. It

275
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,000
will slow down some processes. It will

276
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,599
help with the VPD and that's where the

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,519
powdery mildew will go. That's where the

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,839
spidermitites will go. Uh if you don't

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,240
have hotels, then the people won't go

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,880
stay in the hotels. So that is my

281
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
opinion. Uh my dude Chrisy, uh thank you

282
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,159

298
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,440
question also came from that growhel tab

299
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
on

300
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,920
ienetics.com. Thank you guys for

301
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,239
visiting the website. This question

302
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,639
says, "I have a plant I want to preserve

303
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
in seed form." Oh, this came from our

304
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,759
friend Slick Rick. I should have said

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
that. Slick Rick, check your inbox

306
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,600
because you've got a coupon code for

307
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,159
free seeds, my dude. It says, uh, I have

308
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,000
a plant I want to preserve in seed form.

309
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,759
This makes sense. You've got a plant.

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
Um, perhaps you've got to move. You've

311
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,759
got to take a break from growing. You

312
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
want to preserve this plant in a seed

313
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,879
form. Maybe you just want it in the uh

314
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,799
the box so that when the end of the

315
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,639
world comes, still have this plant in

316
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,639
seed form. Whatever reason, I

317
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,439
understand. It says, "I don't keep a

318
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,000
clone, but I have 40 regular seeds of

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
this cross. How would you recommend I go

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,799
about this? We've got a couple of

321
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,040
options here. Um, I am trying to not

322
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,519
have to keep the mom and I'm okay with

323
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,000
slight variations in each seed, but I

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,560
want to avoid a lottery of phenotypes.

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,559
I've got two 2x4 tents and I can't run

326
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,599
more than four plants at a time. Please

327
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,679
help. So, you've got a plant you want to

328
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,360
preserve. You've got 40 seeds. So, do

329
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,879
you have the plant? Do you have the

330
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,639
specific plant that you want to

331
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,519
preserve? Have you found the phenotype?

332
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,120
Or have you got 40 seeds? I don't keep a

333
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
clone, but I have 40 regular seeds of

334
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
the cross. Either way, you're going to

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,919
have to grow the seeds. If you've all

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
you've got is the seeds, you've got to

337
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,879
grow them. Find your favorite phenotype

338
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
out of these seeds. I would say run 20

339
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,958
of them and find the best. And we've got

340
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,879
two options here. Find the best girl,

341
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,479
the girl that you like the most. When

342
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,399
you smoke it, that's what matters the

343
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
most. Find the female that when you

344
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,519
smoke it, you go Shazam. That is the

345
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,159
weed for me. Find that one. Then also

346
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,320
possibly potentially find a male plant.

347
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,159
That would be another suggestion if you

348
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,360
want to do it this way. Find a male and

349
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,039
a female then or see we got we got three

350
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
options here. We got I keep opening up

351
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,519
options in my brain as we do this. Um

352
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
the easiest way find a boy and a girl

353
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,159
and let them do their thing and you will

354
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,000
make more seeds. Um there will be

355
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,600
variation but you will find the traits

356
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
you're looking for in that offspring.

357
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,159
You're going to make F2. There will be

358
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
variation in your F2. Another thing you

359
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,319
could do, find a couple of females you

360
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,039
like and pollinate them with that same

361
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,639
male. That's an open pollination. You're

362
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,559
going to get the lottery you said you

363
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
don't want. Let's see. Um, I'm not

364
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,399
trying to have to uh slight don't want

365
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
to hunt a lottery of phenos. That's

366
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
going to kind of give you a lottery. So,

367
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,958
don't do the open pollination, but

368
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,799
that's the way to find the fullest

369
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,638
expression of that genotype. You're

370
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,639
going to find all the phenotypes, all

371
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,560
the different traits by doing uh one

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
male to multiple females. you'll find

373
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,319
the open pollination will give you uh

374
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
the phenotype you're looking for and a

375
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
lot of great other options. Now, here is

376
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,519
what I would do. This is probably where

377
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,839
we should have [ __ ] started, right?

378
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,000
Just jump right to it. I would grow

379
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,760
those seeds. Find the plant that you

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839
really like. Find your favorite plant.

381
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,240
That is what this all is all about. Find

382
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,320
the best

383
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,079
female. Take two clones of that female.

384
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
The same exact plant. You got two clones

385
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,479
of it. You're going to have to take

386
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,638
clones if you want this to work this

387
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
way. If you're not going to take clones,

388
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,839
the only way to really do this is to

389
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,919
male female this. But um find the the

390
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
keeper plant that you like. You need two

391
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,599
clones of that plant at this time to

392
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,959
make this work. You're going to reverse

393
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,040
one with silver thio sulfate or I

394
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,199
haven't shared this yet. I've tried a

395
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,919
product called Elite X. I have tried it

396
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,839
two times. I've got 50% success rate

397
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,679
with it. Everybody told me the one plant

398
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
I tried to re reverse was stubborn and

399
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,838
it would not work. I should have [ __ ]

400
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,078
listened. So far, I've got good success

401
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,519
with a product called Elite X. They do

402
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,599
not sponsor me. It's an expensive

403
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,679
product. I straight up pay cash for it

404
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
just like everybody else. Uh I haven't

405
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
advertised it. I haven't talked about

406
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,639
it. I haven't said that that's what I

407
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,639
use on a public forum at all before. Uh

408
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,680
it is called Elite X as a reversal

409
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,480
spray. Um either use silver thioulfate

410
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,559
or Elite X and reverse one of your

411
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,199
plants. That plant will then make

412
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,439
pollen. Put that pollen on the other

413
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,838
copy of that plant. Put it into flower.

414
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,680
put that pollen on the other clone. What

415
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,560
you're going to do, what you do now is

416
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,159
make S1 seeds of that plant. Whatever

417
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,078
this cross is that you have got that you

418
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,278
love, we're going to call it Slick Rick.

419
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:36,479
You've now made Slick Rick S1s. Um, and

420
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,480
those will show very similar phenotypes

421
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,800
to what you're looking for. Depending on

422
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,039
the plant, you'll find somewhere between

423
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,439
40 and 60% of the offspring from this uh

424
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,838
procedure will look just like the plant

425
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
that you played with. the outliers will

426
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,120
be even better. They'll be cool. Uh

427
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
they'll have some secrets you didn't

428
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
know about, but some of the phenotypes

429
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,879
will look just like the plant you

430
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
started with. So you will find what

431
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,958
you're looking for. Now the catch is you

432
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,240
said uh I don't keep clone. You didn't

433
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,679
keep a clone. So um maybe next time do

434
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,278
keep clones. So here's what you got to

435
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,799
do. Here's what I would do. You don't

436
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,759
got to do a damn thing. Here's what I

437
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,078
would do. I would run 20 of these seeds.

438
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,679
I would find my favorite one out of this

439
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,519
batch. You could find your favorite two

440
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,919
if you want, but I would focus on the

441
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
favorite one. Find your favorite two.

442
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,879
You could do three if you want. This is

443
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,800
up to you. But here's what we're going

444
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,720
to do. We're going to take your favorite

445
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,198
one. The best one. You got to pick one

446
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,399
that is the best. Reverse that. That is

447
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,559
my advice. So, you got to grow this

448
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,919
plant. Find it. Keep a clone of it is

449
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,838
the main [ __ ] thing that I skipped

450
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,679
here. Uh, grow this plant. Get a clone.

451
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
Grow all these. Get clones of them. Keep

452
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,278
your favorite. The favorite has got to

453
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
be kept. Then get two clones of that

454
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,799
one. I know I'm [ __ ] rambling. It's

455
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
been a long week, you guys. Uh, get two

456
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,958
clones of your favorite plant and spray

457
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
one and pollinate the other one with

458
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,000
that pollen. You can also put other

459
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,759
females in the room when you do this.

460
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Just in case there's another female that

461
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
you really like or another strain that

462
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
you like, even put a clone of that in

463
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,278
the room also. You're going to throw

464
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,120
pollen. Why not put pollen on two,

465
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,278
three, four, five other plants and see

466
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,879
what you create? I know you want to make

467
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,320
the preservation. That will happen. But

468
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,720
also by pollinating other plants, you

469
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,800
get to do something that I find is fun.

470
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
When you pollinate plant, let's say I've

471
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,399
got a mango drink here in front of me.

472
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,399
Let's just say we took strawberry and we

473
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
pollinated mango. We're going to get

474
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
strawberry mango, right? We should.

475
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,799
Maybe it's more strawberry. Maybe it's

476
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,279
more mango. We're going to find out. We

477
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,120
don't know really what that male plant

478
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,120
is doing in that mix other than giving

479
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
us strawberry flavor. And the female

480
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,799
gives us mango. That's what we get. If I

481
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
take that strawberry and mix it to

482
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,120
mango, chocolate, and lime, and then we

483
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,039
grow all of those, we can find the

484
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,039
commonalities among the amongst those

485
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,799
phenotypes, and that's coming from the

486
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,719
male, that's coming from the strawberry.

487
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,838
If all three of these plants hold a

488
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
similar trait, it couldn't have came

489
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,120
from the females. They were different

490
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,039
females. That's what the male is

491
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,399
contributing to this breeding project.

492
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,078
So, that's why I like to pollinate

493
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,600
multiple females when I'm doing it. I'm

494
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,198
off on a side tangent. That's not what

495
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,279
you asked at all, but that's part of

496
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
what I would do if I was doing this. Um,

497
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,480
when I'm pollen chucking, when I'm

498
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,880
making plants, why not put something

499
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
new, experimental, brand new, what the

500
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
[ __ ] in there every time, and see what

501
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,799
happens. Uh, most of what I do is really

502
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,240
thought out. Sometimes it's a, well,

503
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,480
let's see what this one [ __ ] does.

504
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
Just curiosity just because. And

505
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,959
sometimes, you guys, those are the

506
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,600
[ __ ] winners. So, um, you want to

507
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,360
preserve a plant, easiest way, uh, make

508
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,879
S1 seeds out of it. That's what I should

509
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,558
have said in the beginning. Thank you

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
for letting me ramble, my dude. Uh,

511
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,720
Slick Rick, I've got your your email, so

512
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,799
check your inbox for a coupon code for

513
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,440
free seeds from

514
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:44,879
ireieirect.com. All right, I know I'm

515
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,480
rambly. I know I'm high as giraffe

516
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
[ __ ] but we're going to keep this show

517
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,319
going. Um, this one also came from the

518
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,480
growhelp tab on IDirect. This one came

519
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,720
from somebody who wants to be called new

520
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,319
to growing. Welcome to growing, bro. I

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
hope it's going well for you. The

522
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,119
question goes a lot like this. It says,

523
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,759
"Are silica additives like armor sigh

524
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,959
and rhino skin necessary in a drainto

525
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,720
waste cocoaquar? And if they are, how

526
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
should they be used?" I'm sorry if this

527
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
has been asked before. Um, no. I am not

528
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,599
familiar with answering any questions

529
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
about silicates before. The question is,

530
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,240
are silicut additives are they

531
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
necessary? I don't know that uh they're

532
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,919
not required, but they definitely do

533
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,919
have benefits. You'll notice more robust

534
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
plants. You'll notice thicker stems.

535
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,640
You'll notice plants that can handle

536
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,719
stress a little bit better. If you

537
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
forget to water, they'll tolerate that a

538
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,759
little bit better. If you give them too

539
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,679
much heat, they will tolerate that a

540
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,919
little bit better. So, uh, the reason

541
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
they're called [ __ ] like armor and rhino

542
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,600
skin is because they make the plants a

543
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,759
it's armor. It makes them a little bit

544
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,079
tougher. So, not required, not

545
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,480
necessary, but beneficial if you do it.

546
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,839
If it's in the budget, go for it. Uh,

547
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
next part of the question, how would

548
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,279
they be used? Uh, I would recommend the

549
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,759
first piece of advice when you have your

550
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,599
your reservoir, your bucket, your water,

551
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,400
whatever you're mixing into, the

552
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,079
silicate product goes first. Put that

553
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
product in there first. Whatever amount

554
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,319
you choose to use, uh, whatever dilution

555
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,720
solution rate you're putting in there.

556
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,119
Uh, the first thing to do is put in the

557
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
silicate product very first. Put that in

558
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,479
there and then stir it. Are we stirring

559
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
it? I don't remember. I was told which

560
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
way. I think we go clockwise. Stir it

561
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,640
clockwise a few times. Get it moved up.

562
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
Then stir it counterclockwise a couple

563
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
of times just to get it in there. That

564
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,879
does something ionically. All you uh

565
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,639
organic chemistry nerds, fill me in. I

566
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
pay attention, but it doesn't all stick,

567
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,038
you guys. Uh so, put the silicut product

568
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,879
in first. Stir it. Stir it the other

569
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,160
way. Then start adding your other

570
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
products after that. Then I would go

571
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
with my base nutrients. Uh probably calm

572
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
mag or not calm mag after that, liquid

573
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,720
karma is what I would do after that. But

574
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,360
work your way down the line. Uh but the

575
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,360
potassium silicates go first. Then the

576
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,079
next thing I would think about is the

577
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,399
recommended dosage. Uh depending on what

578
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,079
product you're using, uh some of the

579
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
brands I would use the recommended

580
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,038
dosage. Some of them are pretty strong

581
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,759
and I would use 50%. Maybe start off

582
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,160
with about 50% of the recommended dose.

583
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,319
Feed your plants that uh see what it

584
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,400
does. If it's not giving you any

585
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,519
response, increase to 75. If you don't

586
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,038
see any response, maybe go to 85. But by

587
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,160
the time you get to 100, you'll see if

588
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,000
you're burning them and they'll start

589
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,360
acting weird. Uh the ends of the leaves

590
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,960
will turn a little crispy brown. The

591
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,279
leaf tips will start pointing straight

592
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,798
up. Uh they might curl up a little bit.

593
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,038
So if you're using too much silicates,

594
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,359
the plants will let you know. Uh so

595
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,919
start off with maybe 50 and then slowly

596
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,759
increase the application rate from

597
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,038
there. All right, my dude. New to

598
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,400
growing. I hope I answered your

599
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,200
question. Um it's not necessary, but it

600
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,480
helps. and uh add it to the res first

601
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,159
and start with a 50% of the recommended

602
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,079
dosage. All right, I've got a good

603
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,919
momentum going here. I like giving away

604
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,199
free seeds. Uh how long have we been

605
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,720
going? We haven't even been going that

606
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,960
long. We got time for a lot more, you

607
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,759
guys. This one also came from that

608
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,038
growhel tab on i redirect.com. This one

609
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,640
came from our friend who wants to be

610
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,119
known as cloud. I like that name. It

611
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
makes me think of Final Fantasy. Um use

612
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,399
the material, bro. Anyway, the question

613
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
goes like this. It says, "Hey, Rosta

614
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,240
Jeff. I love the show. Thank you, man.

615
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
I've learned a ton watching you and the

616
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,159
dude grows. Big shout out to the dude

617
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,439
grows. Make sure you check

618
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,600
dgcup.com. Come say hi to me at the dude

619
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,519
grows show. The dude grows cup. It says,

620
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,079
"First, I want to say thank you, sir. I

621
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,240
wouldn't be where I am now without our

622
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,480
without your guidance and knowledge."

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,679
Bro, thank you. Uh, I know I read a lot

624
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,519
of comments and stuff like that and I

625
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,880
blow right past it. That does stick.

626
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,639
That does mean a lot to me. So, thank

627
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
you. That's that's a recharge. That's

628
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,038
some potassium silicate. That's a bloom

629
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,678
booster for a podcaster. So, thank you.

630
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,319
Uh, there's more. It says, "My question

631
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
is, I bought a ton of nutrients at a

632
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,240
grow store that was closing down." All

633
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,880
right, that's a good deal. Um, and now I

634
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,960
wonder um how long I will be able to get

635
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
away with how long I will be able to get

636
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,038
away with storing these nutrients before

637
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
I see negative effects on them. Do the

638
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,798
products we use have a shelf life or is

639
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,840
it a chemical that will be good for a

640
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,839
decent amount of time? Big up. Keep the

641
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,959
knowledge going. My bro Cloud, thank you

642
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,279
for the good question. And this is

643
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,480
something that uh people often overlook,

644
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,279
something that probably should have been

645
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,919
brought up a very long time ago. Um

646
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,839
those products all have a shelf life. I

647
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
wouldn't recommend uh more than a

648
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,199
one-year life on those products. They

649
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,480
are uh sold in different bottles for a

650
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,000
reason. They are um and I was told I say

651
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,640
this word wrong, but I learned it from a

652
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,798
Canadian. So um they are buffered and

653
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
keelated. Are they ladated or keelated?

654
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,200
Somebody [ __ ] you can't do it because

655
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,279
you're just going to type it. I'm never

656
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,960
going to know. Is it key or she? Tell me

657
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,480
in the [ __ ] comments because somebody

658
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
always tells me I'm saying it wrong. If

659
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
I say it either way, it's wrong. So,

660
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,879
we're going to say keelate because it

661
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,319
sounds better to me today. But they are

662
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
buffered and keelated inside that

663
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,798
bottle. If I'm saying it wrong, I feel

664
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,240
fully rworded right now. Um, but they

665
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:55,679
are not meant to sit around for a long

666
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,079
time and they're especially not meant to

667
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,759
be uh together for a reason. They will

668
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,079
bind. They will get chunky. Those things

669
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,519
will start to fall out of solution. Have

670
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,439
you ever grabbed a bottle of nutrients

671
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,960
and shaken it up to use it and it

672
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
sounded like there was little bottles or

673
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
little chunks of salt in the bottom of

674
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,759
the bottle? There are chunks of salt.

675
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,000
That is your nutrients. All the stuff

676
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,440
you paid for is now bonded up at the

677
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,599
bottom and made a little cake and now

678
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
you're pouring colored water into your

679
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,839
feed mix. That's all you're getting. So,

680
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,919
uh, yes, there is about a oneyear shelf

681
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,439
life on most of those products. And

682
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,759
depending on how long they've been

683
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,000
sitting on that shelf, the time may be

684
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,558
ticking. Who knows? I'd like to say a

685
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,159
year from when you open it, but how long

686
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,839
has it been sitting there? Maybe that

687
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,280
that like I said, the time is ticking

688
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,678
from the minute they make that [ __ ] and

689
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,038
start shipping it. The time is ticking.

690
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
So, I wouldn't keep it around for more

691
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,200
than one year. Um, give it a sniff. If

692
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,720
it smells bad, it's getting fun. Well,

693
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
some of that [ __ ] smells bad the day you

694
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,000
open it. If your photosynthesis plus

695
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,759
smells good, it has gone bad. That's Oh,

696
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,839
man. That one smells terrible. But give

697
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,079
it a smell. It should smell familiar. If

698
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,319
it gets chunkier than it was, it's

699
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,480
probably got a problem to it. So, that

700
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,240
is my advice. Uh, and I am sticking to

701
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,839
it. My dude cloud, make sure you check

702
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,599
your inbox because like all of the great

703
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,000
folks before you, you've got a coupon

704
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,959
code for free seeds at

705
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,480
ireiedirect.com. Boys and girls, I have

706
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,079
enjoyed the rapid fire pace of this

707
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,599
show. If you like it, uh, leave some

708
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,678
comments down below. I do like your

709
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,599
comments. Uh, tell me go faster, go

710
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
slower. Uh, let me know if you could

711
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,158
tell that my voice just sounds terrible

712
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,079
in the headphones. Um, but we do not

713
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,159
miss uploads. All right, here we go. Uh,

714
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,759
this one came from our friend Lazy Boy.

715
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
Shout out to my buddy Lazy Boy. I know

716
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,240
the feeling today, bro. The question

717
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,439
says, um, "How you doing, Rost Jeff? I

718
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,440
love the page." And, uh, my question is,

719
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,159
can you make seeds in a tent or is it

720
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,919
better to make seeds outside in the sun

721
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,720
or does it matter at all where you make

722
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,919
the seeds? Well, um I would say make

723
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,480
your seeds wherever you can, but indoors

724
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,400
in a tent is my preferred environment.

725
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
Um because I can control everything in

726
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,640
there. I'm a control freak when it comes

727
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,960
to growing outdoors. I don't know if

728
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
somebody in my block in my neighborhood

729
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,360
um four miles away is growing cannabis

730
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,759
and put a male outside or maybe there's

731
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,000
a hemp farm with the male outside and my

732
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,679
crop got pollinated with that random

733
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
stray pollen. There's no way to prevent

734
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,480
that, detect that. Um, I don't know

735
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,400
that. So, I don't like growing um

736
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,120
outside for seed. I would prefer to do

737
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,080
that indoors in a tent environment. I

738
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,918
have, however, had amazing success

739
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,158
breeding plants outdoors in a

740
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,320
greenhouse. Um, I rented a greenhouse

741
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,840
from a friend two years in a row. We put

742
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,240
a few plants out there and we made

743
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,079
impressive amounts of seeds. The seeds

744
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,759
that came from the greenhouse, those

745
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,759
seeds were fatter. They were more

746
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,319
robust. They had a better germination

747
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,558
rate. and there were a [ __ ] lot of

748
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,240
them. Um, and it was basically free to

749
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,678
grow it out outdoors. We had to do

750
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,440
maintenance and care and we had to be

751
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,120
there and I had to rent the space. Uh,

752
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,720
but there was no electrical cost and

753
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,199
that was huge cuz the lights are the

754
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
most expensive part. But the reason I

755
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
enjoyed that is because I was in a

756
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
greenhouse and we had fans and we had

757
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,039
air air exchange system to prevent

758
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,959
pollen from coming in. No pollen would

759
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,960
come in, air was going out. We had

760
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,798
negative pressure blowing the air out.

761
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,240
Uh, so uh that way we couldn't get

762
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,359
accidental pollination. So, if you're

763
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,440
going to breed uh other than indoors, I

764
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,759
recommend some sort of control, some

765
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,000
sort of greenhouse environment, but my

766
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,839
favorite is indoors. That outdoors was

767
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
awesome because uh it was very

768
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,079
profitable. It made a lot of seeds, but

769
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919
also it was very easy to get problems

770
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,319
out there. So, most of my stuff is

771
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,159
indoors. N I think 99% of what I've ever

772
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,639
sold has been bred indoors. There were

773
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
two crops of outdoor seeds, and I know

774
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
there was no pollen contamination there

775
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,918
because first of all, all the progyny

776
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,678
looked right. And first of all, we made

777
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,320
precautions to make sure no pollen would

778
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,919
get in. All right. Uh my dude lazy boy,

779
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,038
don't be too lazy because you got a pack

780
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,960
of seeds coming. You're gonna have to

781
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,480
get up and go to the mailbox and get the

782
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
mail because you've got a gift from

783
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,919
Rosta Jeff. All right, ladies and

784
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,640
gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes,

785
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,880
friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone

786
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
cutters, pollen chuckers, um all you

787
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
healthy people, and all of you folks

788
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,278
with head colds. I want to thank

789
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,879
everybody for listening to this podcast.

790
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,798
I do apologize for sounding a little bit

791
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,080
funky. I tried to put out a decent

792
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,319
quality show. It might be a little bit

793
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,678
short. I'm not even sure. But thank you.

794
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,960
Thanks for all the support. Thank you

795
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,000
your question on today's podcast, please

807
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,600
do not feel discouraged. I have got

808
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,519
reams of paper over here that I've

809
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,439
printed out with amazing grow questions.

810
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,599
I cannot get through them all, but I

811
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
will do my best. Maybe your question

812
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,439
will pop up on the next episode. If

813
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,959
you've got questions, please send them.

816
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559

817
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,319
with fresh new content. I want to give a

818
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,319
big shout out to my buddy OG Purple

819
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,399
