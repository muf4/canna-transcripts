10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,490
by talking about what I'm smoking today

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,410
I've been taking dabs of watermelon

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,868
gelato ambrosia from our friends at

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,570
apothecary farms the potency label says

14
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,630
that this product contains sixty four

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,090
point six percent THC and seventy six

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,010
point seven percent total cannabinoids

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm gonna crack the jar open now so we

18
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,030
can give it a little smell I really

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,120
enjoy the aroma and flavor of this

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,399
concentrate immediately I am punched in

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,369
the face by a sweet watermelon flavor

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,679
followed by a light gas eNOS that I

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,349
really enjoy it as a watermelon sweet

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,628
gassy flavor when you dab it that

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,730
watermelon flavor just coats your mouth

26
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,009
when you exhale that gas eNOS kind of

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,679
sticks in a little bit and then the room

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,260
is left with a delicious watermelon

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,740
candy sort of an aroma I really enjoy

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,868

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,539

to www.redcross.org

53
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:19,169
and I keep seeing in social media

54
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:23,849
recently Mike Tyson was quoted saying

55
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:26,939
that he smokes approximately $40,000 a

56
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,979
month in cannabis and cannabis products

57
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,079
now I don't think he meant himself

58
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,959
personally I think that that is him in

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,930
his entourage or his crew but imagine

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,060
what 40,000 dollars in cannabis products

61
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,500
would look like now cannabis pricing

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,780
does change throughout the country and

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,419
absolutely around the world Mike Tyson

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,699
has a ranch in Northern California where

65
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,699
prices were quite stable we're going to

66
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,159
give a rough guess but for good quality

67
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:56,729
product in my Tyson's area he's probably

68
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,310
paying around $2,000 a pound for the

69
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,259
product he is smoking it could be 15 it

70
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,000
could be 25 I don't know what's going on

71
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,139
in Cali right now we're gonna guess he's

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,189
paying $2,000 a pound and he's smoking

73
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,699
40,000 dollars worth of product that is

74
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,859
20 pounds of cannabis every month for

75
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,599
Mike Tyson and his crew I don't know how

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,390
many people are in that crew but they

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,030
are 11 it up if you think about that if

78
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,899
you break that down into retail terms if

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:28,919
you look at $40,000 worth of cannabis at

80
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,510
$25 an eighth that is 1608 so how many

81
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,280
eighths do you smoke if you're a flower

82
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,409
smoker how long does an eighth last you

83
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,479
how long does a quarter last you if you

84
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,639
smoke by the quarter that is 800

85
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,799
quarters how long would that last you

86
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,389
how long what 800 quarters last you a

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,640
lot of people I'm not sure where you're

88
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,859
from it depends on your location your

89
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,019
budget and the availability but most

90
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,930
folks tend to smoke about a gram a day

91
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,880
seven grams a week seems to be expected

92
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,590
a half ounce a week for some a little

93
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,269
heavier smokers and then in the legal

94
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,650
states an ounce a week is not a problem

95
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,930
but these people are smoking $40,000

96
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,670
worth of cannabis and a month so they

97
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,200
claim and it could have been a joke it

98
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,789
was Mike Tyson he could have been just

99
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,009
laughing and telling a joke when he said

100
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:13,079
it a lot of times people like to speak

101
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,729
in hyperbole especially stoners

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,199
especially when we're talking about our

103
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,988
plants and our product there may be a

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,449
little exaggeration there but that man

105
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:25,259
went on a public forum and said we

106
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,879
smoked 40 grand in cannabis every month

107
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,719
and just for a concentrate smoker for

108
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,659
concentrates depending on whether you

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,460
shop some places it's 30 grams some

110
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,680
places it's 50 grams so I'm gonna go

111
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:40,849
with the $40 a gram mark and we're gonna

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,759
say that is 1,000 grams of concentrates

113
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,580
in a month that means I get to smoke 30

114
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,889
grams a day right I get to smoke 33

115
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:53,029
grams of concentrates every day if we

116
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,650
were smoking 40 grand and product so if

117
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:57,500
these guys are smoking concentrate bear

118
00:04:54,649 --> 00:05:00,560
smoking thirty-three point three grams

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,060
every single day on the Tyson ranch I

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,699
don't know how many people that is if

121
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,280
that is ten people that's pretty heavy

122
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,620
consumption if there are 20 people

123
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,119
you're smoking down if you got 30 people

124
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,370
there that's about a gram a day per

125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,139
person and that is acceptable maybe one

126
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,519
person's hit and a half a gram maybe you

127
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,560
got a guy like me over there smoking 2

128
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,120
grams a day but if you've got more than

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,069
30 or so people over there that is not

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,050
heavy consumption you're just smoking a

131
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,490
lot of people out and of course Tyson

132
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,199
does have a ranch where people come and

133
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,759
visit they can hang out on the ranch

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,370
it's like a vacation destination for

135
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,349
some folks I am sure that some of that

136
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,269
product is being shared and consumed

137
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,970
with his guests and visitors because

138
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:40,879
Mike Tyson is a polite and kind dude so

139
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,320
I hope he's sharing some of that $40,000

140
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,689
worth of product with all of his friends

141
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,060
over at the Tyson ranch you guys if I

142
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,978
had thirty three point three grams of

143
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,509
concentrate to smoke today would you

144
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,519
want to come over and give me a hand I

145
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,899
hope I can count on you all right I just

146
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,279
wanted to mention that because I thought

147
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,739
that was very entertaining I've seen

148
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,138
that pop up on every social media outlet

149
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,060
available Mike Tyson smokes forty

150
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,728
thousand dollars in cannabis every month

151
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,069
that has been a headline I'm very amused

152
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:08,449
that that has become news all right

153
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,099
let's move into something that we can

154
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,189

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,960
read today comes from a friend in Canada

165
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,490
it does not say if they want us to use

166
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,019
their name so I'm going to skip that

167
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,329
what's up to our friend in Canada thank

168
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:41,339

169
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,439
like this much love from Canada

170
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,969
I'm three weeks into my first flower and

171
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,699
I can only wish I had stumbled across

172
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,920
your podcast earlier you are an

173
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,750
impressive person simple as that hey

174
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,850
that is a great compliment it kind of

175
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,079
made me shy suddenly that's awkward but

176
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,790
I appreciate that man thank you for

177
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,979
listening and learning and I'm glad that

178
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,350
you find my knowledge that I share to be

179
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,730
impressive it goes on to say the support

180
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,250
you showed toward the community and

181
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,590
depth of knowledge is unparalleled it's

182
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,500
not just the content but the delivery is

183
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:12,869
honest and informative that means a lot

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,870
to me because that is my exact goal is

185
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,269
to deliver in depth knowledge that is

186
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,220
unparalleled and to have honest and

187
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:23,129
informative delivery and to sound good

188
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,260
and to be a supporter and leader for the

189
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,969
community so in one short sentence there

190
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,589

192
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,959

194
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,469

195
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,569

cool so thank you there where was I lost

197
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,209
my place it goes on to say I started in

198
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:44,610
around episode 351 and it is amazing how

199
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,259
much I have learned now I'm going back

200
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,540
to the very beginning man you have

201
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,980
listened to a hundred and something

202
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,300
episodes and now you're going all the

203
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,420
way back to the beginning you were going

204
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,040
to have a very solid cannabis education

205
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,230
thank you for listening to so many shows

206
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,120
it's going to be a bit embarrassing when

207
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,120
you hear my old stuff I was not quite

208
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,680
the podcaster I have become now but you

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,930
got to start somewhere so listen to them

210
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,629
critique me also don't forget that the

211
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,420
first 19 episodes of the show are

212
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:14,519
available in a playlist on my youtube

213
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,590
channel if you go to youtube search for

214
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,299
the grow from your heart podcasts find

215
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,060
my youtube channel there's a playlist on

216
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,270
that channel called the first 20 or the

217
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,740
first 19 episodes a very long time ago

218
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,930
the podcast was called something

219
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,699
different but I was sent a a letter that

220
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,070
said I cannot use that name anymore so I

221
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,659
had to change the name of the show when

222
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,610
I changed the name of the show I created

223
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,500
a different YouTube channel things

224
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,080
change anyway the old episodes are

225
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,090
available 1 through 19 are available on

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,220
a playlist on YouTube so don't miss

227
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,139
those I'm gonna catch up in the email

228
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,000
where was I'm going back to the

229
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,309
beginning I even have my brother his

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,929
wife and mother-in-law hooked on your

231
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,899
show that's amazing you've gotten three

232
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,259
four to three other people hooked on the

233
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,449
show

234
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,970
I appreciate that then it says I've

235
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,060
worked for 13 years now as an addiction

236
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,440
counselor and it baffles me the

237
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,269
misconceptions with cannabis

238
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,760
you know I completely agree with you

239
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,740
about the misconceptions of cannabis

240
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,960
that is partly why I do a podcast I feel

241
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,789
like I sound like a mostly educated guy

242
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,220
I don't have the highest level of

243
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,289
education but I am just ah what's it

244
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,820
called naturally intelligent I guess I'm

245
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,779
a smart dude just naturally I didn't

246
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,550
have to go to school and learn a bunch

247
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,639
of stuff I can speak I can convey my

248
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:29,339
thoughts and I am also a heavy cannabis

249
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,019
user and an advocate and I feel like

250
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,450
coming on here and speaking mostly

251
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,429
articulately I present myself fairly

252
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,620
well and I feel like I represent the

253
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:39,449
cannabis community in a mostly positive

254
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,860
light some people may not like the fact

255
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,270
that I start the show off by taking a

256
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,220
couple dabs and then come on and tell

257
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,049
you what I'm smoking that may not be for

258
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,700
some people that's how I do it it works

259
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,069
very well for me but I feel like I

260
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,629
represent us in a mostly positive light

261
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,610
I feel like I speak well I feel like I'm

262
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,649
articulate enough to get my point across

263
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,509
I feel like people don't think I'm just

264
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,939
some stupid stoner when I do the show so

265
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,980
I like to come on and do a show that all

266
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,900
of the experienced growers can listen to

267
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,580
and be entertained and possibly learn

268
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,189
something then I like to have a show

269
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,780
that maybe some brand new smoker could

270
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,130
smoke with grandma and say hey listen to

271
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,629
this guy grandma he's gonna teach you

272
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:15,720
some stuff and then maybe grandma can

273
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,730
learn about CBD or grandma can lessen

274
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,200
some of her fear of cannabis maybe

275
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,389
grandma's sick and it's time for her to

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,610
consider putting some CBD in her diet

277
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,080
and maybe my show could be one of the

278
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,940
things that helps to break the ice we

279
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,320
can bring people together non consumers

280
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,090
and consumers believers and

281
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,420
non-believers maybe I can bridge that

282
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,879
gap by being a good advocate a good

283
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,559
ambassador a good spokesperson I've kind

284
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,200
of taken it upon myself to play that

285
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,119
role in my life in the cannabis industry

286
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,160
in the cannabis world in the cannabis

287
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,810
community and that's a big part of what

288
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,029
started me doing the podcast is the

289
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:50,339
misconceptions and the false information

290
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,230
that people are putting on the Internet

291
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,120
I needed to speak up I needed to say hey

292
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,039
a lot of that stuff is wrong a lot of

293
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,539
that stuff is inaccurate and I wanted to

294
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,789
come do a show that is not based on

295
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,409
selling products or lining pockets or

296
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,779
making money for anybody I want to come

297
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:05,309
teach you to grow from your heart so

298
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,259
that is a lot of what led to this

299
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,088
podcast I'm way off topic on a rant here

300
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,289
but hey it's my show you get

301
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,850
Podcast if you want to rant about

302
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:14,610
something let's get ourselves back on

303
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,499
track there is a lot more to this email

304
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,269
that I cut out because I felt that some

305
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:20,189
of this was personal and I wanted to

306
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,709
keep that between my friend and I we're

307
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:24,269
gonna catch up where it gets back to

308
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,278
where I want to share with you guys you

309
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,799
got rambley also and it says aw [ __ ] I'm

310
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,019
rambling anyway I appreciate your

311
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,349
approach keep up the good work and now

312
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,179
for my question he says I built a little

313
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,459
grow room in my garage so we've got a

314
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,188
little grow room in a garage so it goes

315
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,888
on to say I used a dryer ducting with a

316
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:46,078
four inch inline exhaust fan for air out

317
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,028
so we're using a four inch probably a

318
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,938
squirrel cage fan maybe a little blower

319
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:53,879
and some dryer ducting to duct the hot

320
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:57,028
stale air out of the room it goes on to

321
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,759
say air intake is also a 4 inch dryer

322
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:01,919
duct which pulls air directly from the

323
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,409
outside so that probably happens

324
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,938
naturally from the passive air as you

325
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:07,740
are pulling that air out of the room

326
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:09,448
with that blower you're probably sucking

327
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,370
fresh air right in through that intake

328
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:13,620
because air will travel the path of

329
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,389
least resistance every bit of air that

330
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,519
leaves that environment does need to be

331
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,549
replaced so it will naturally come in

332
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,919
through that passive vent it goes on to

333
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:25,109
say being from northern Canada it gets

334
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,818
cold as hell here in the winter that's

335
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,370
kind of an odd statement because I have

336
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:30,990
always envisioned held to be quite hot

337
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,610
but now that I think about it some of

338
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,259
the shittiest moments in my life have

339
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,178
been when I've been too [ __ ] cold

340
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,068
everybody hates to be too cold that is

341
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:41,730
miserable maybe we've got it all wrong

342
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:43,378
you guys maybe hell is ice let's get

343
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,749
back on track here it keeps going it

344
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:47,100
says I have a small space heater that

345
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:49,829
keeps the room at the desired

346
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,620
temperature but will that cold air

347
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:56,338
coming in be an issue as long as it is

348
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,899
not too close to the plants now this is

349
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,850
a very good question this brings up a

350
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,860
lot of good talking points this is very

351
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,540
similar to the last episode where the

352
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,669
guy was trying to cool his grow tent

353
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,678
we've got a couple of things to think

354
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,708
about here you were bringing that cold

355
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:13,948
Canadian winter air directly into your

356
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:16,649
grow room if that air is really cold I'm

357
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:18,208
a completely advise against that there

358
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,409
are a couple of reasons why this may be

359
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:22,229
a bad idea

360
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:23,100
I don't know how cold that air is now I

361
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,500
do

362
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,149
as soon as it snows it is too cold you

363
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,250
don't want to bring that air into the

364
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,500
room but I do have some solutions and

365
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,570
some other things to think about first

366
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,208
let's talk about ducting that cool air

367
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,040
into the room you can do that you want

368
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,989
to know if you can do it without causing

369
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,490
problems to the plants if it is too

370
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,899
close to the plants if it is too close

371
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,350
to the plants they will definitely get

372
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,839
cold and get pissed off the VPD around

373
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,550
that area is going to go haywire you're

374
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,410
gonna have cold air coming in then you

375
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:54,088
got a fan blowing around that ambient

376
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,828
air you're gonna get a lot of mixing of

377
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,769
air in that area the plants are not

378
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,778
going to like it then you are going to

379
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,299
create the perfect environment for

380
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,730
powdery mildew you are bringing in wet

381
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,620
air you were bringing in cold air and

382
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,050
you are mixing that with the warm air

383
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,720
that is already in your grow room that

384
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:15,929
is going to create the perfect condition

385
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,850
for powdery mildew wet air plus a warm

386
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:21,000
environment is going to start powdery

387
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,980
mildew wet air just coming into the room

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,009
is going to create powdery mildew

389
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,289
situations temperature swings are going

390
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,120
to create powdery mildew situations when

391
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,309
that light goes off and you're still

392
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,769
bringing in that cold canada snowy air

393
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,269
it is going to get cold really quickly

394
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,750
in there and that is going to promote

395
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,980
powdery mildew conditions also bringing

396
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,600
in that cold air may make your floor

397
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,789
ridiculously cold also your Canadian

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,110
floor is probably really cold anyway in

399
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,179
winter I would recommend getting your

400
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,950
plants up off the floor in the winter

401
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,019
you don't want your plants on the floor

402
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,180
I'm here in Colorado I don't want my

403
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,159
plants on a concrete floor imagine

404
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,509
waking up out of bed first thing you do

405
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,850
you got to put your feet on the cold

406
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,319
concrete floor in the in my story

407
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,639
there's no carpet in your house you've

408
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,829
got to go straight to the concrete floor

409
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,990
that's gonna suck you don't want to put

410
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:11,429
your feet on that frozen floor first

411
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,709
thing when you wake up that makes you

412
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,179
grouchy it pisses you off that is how

413
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,039
the plants feel they don't want to be

414
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,979
sitting on the cold floor all day long

415
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,809
either so we like to elevate them then

416
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,310
when you water them if they're down

417
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,989
there on that cold floor you put the

418
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:26,849
water in there they're even colder now

419
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,829
they're wet and cold you got cold wet

420
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,240
feet nobody enjoys that so we want to

421
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,219
get the plants up off the floor we want

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,139
to get the roots warm let's focus more

423
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,329
on bringing this cool air into the grow

424
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,129
room we're talking about bringing

425
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:40,198
cold air into the room you can do that

426
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,360
but you do have to pay attention to the

427
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,708
temperature of the air once it gets

428
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,568
beyond 65 degrees 60 degrees you may

429
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,318
need to warm that air before it enters

430
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:51,389
the room

431
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,849
in the previous episode we talked about

432
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:57,028
treating the room and then introducing

433
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,470
that air into the grow area so maybe you

434
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:00,720
can bring that air into another area

435
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,459
warm it up and then dump that air into

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,470
the grow again I don't know your

437
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,958
environment you may not have another

438
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,369
space that you can heat up now you say

439
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,198
that you've got a space heater in there

440
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:12,389
imagine what's gonna happen when that

441
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,219
cold air and that space heater start

442
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,350
colliding that hot air in that cold air

443
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,170
that's just like when you go outside and

444
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,089
you do that thing in the winter and you

445
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:22,588
see steam you were doing that [ __ ] in

446
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:24,420
your grow room where's that moisture

447
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,639
gonna go it's got to land somewhere it's

448
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,078
gonna create powdery mildew conditions

449
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,789
in that gross space you're gonna give

450
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,708
yourself the option for powdery mildew

451
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,629
now another thing we really need to

452
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,058
think about if you are just bringing air

453
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:38,819
from outside what else is coming in with

454
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:40,588
that air now it is less likely in the

455
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:42,599
cold winter conditions that you're going

456
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,369
to bring in some sort of problems but

457
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,759
there is always the possibility of

458
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:49,798
bringing in a pest or a pathogen imagine

459
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,209
if you were a bug and you're walking by

460
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:52,860
and it's [ __ ] snowing or it's about

461
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,688
to snow and it's cold and the sun's

462
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,639
going down and out of the corner of your

463
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:59,610
eye what do you see that bright white

464
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,110
glow of a grow light and you know that

465
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,058
that's warmth what are you gonna do

466
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,349
you're gonna buzz right over there and

467
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:05,939
you're gonna fly around the light and

468
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,230
then later you're gonna get hungry and

469
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,548
what are you gonna do you're gonna fly

470
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,798
down you're gonna look in those plants

471
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:12,359
for something to eat maybe just maybe

472
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,500
that cannabis plant will be the food

473
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,898
that you want and you will start

474
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,308
munching on it then what's gonna happen

475
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:19,138
if you're a little bug you're nice and

476
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:21,058
full you're chillin got a nice warm spot

477
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,648
to live probably gonna want to find

478
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,638
someone to hang out with if you know

479
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:25,198
what I mean so you're gonna go in a

480
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:27,359
little quest you're gonna go out that

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,620
ducting again and go find some ladies

482
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,298
you're gonna bring them back to the warm

483
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,798
spot then what's gonna happen you're

484
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,418
gonna make a whole bunch of more bugs

485
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,638
and all those bugs are gonna go all over

486
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,200
those plants and then guess what they're

487
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,369
gonna start making more babies and then

488
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,288
you're gonna have a whole bunch of bugs

489
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:42,989
all over your plants so it happens

490
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:44,849
really quickly that open duct you've got

491
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,038
air coming in they don't even have to

492
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,719
fly they can just passively float right

493
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,160
on in they're gonna get blown on in with

494
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,930
the wind like bodysurfing

495
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,210
right into your grow so if you were

496
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,580
going to have a vent coming in I

497
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,620
definitely recommend some sort of a

498
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:00,210
cover on the end of that ducting I've

499
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,219
mentioned on episodes before that I have

500
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,259
seen snakes and [ __ ] come in through

501
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,630
that ducting I've found the lizards in

502
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,279
grow rooms I found weird [ __ ] and grows

503
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,870
and I'm certain that he came in through

504
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,460
that ducting if not it was some sort of

505
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,739
Voodoo so I really hope it came in

506
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,600
through that duct I would put a very

507
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,190
classic move is to put some panty hose

508
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,079
at the end of the duct it doesn't

509
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,779
restrict any air flow and it will stop

510
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,000
bugs from getting in they also sell a

511
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:26,279
really expensive device called the dust

512
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,630
shroom or the shroom cover that just

513
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,180
goes right at the end of your ducting

514
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,410
that is a very noticeable piece of

515
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,450
equipment if you've got that on your

516
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,480
duct people on the outside will notice

517
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,610
that you can also use the HEPA filters

518
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,529
that they sell at Home Depot or your

519
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,479
local hardware store is just a square

520
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:44,879
and it's a filter and you can cut it to

521
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,589
the size you need I use a staple gun and

522
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,930
just staple that right over the hole

523
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,490
then run that ducting flush right up

524
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,440
against the filter put a little bit of

525
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,910
duct tape around it then anything that

526
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,470
comes in or comes out has to pass

527
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,300
through that filter you can't get any

528
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,829
bugs that will definitely limit the

529
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,809
amount of pathogens that can pass

530
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:02,339
through your ducting now if you are

531
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,839
running that ducting in the winter

532
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,359
months and you would like to cool that

533
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,929
air a good idea that you can use is to

534
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:12,089
run that air over your lights if you've

535
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,920
got vented light hoods if you've got the

536
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,419
kind of hoods that have got a duct on

537
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,759
each end where you can put ducting and

538
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,640
inducting out what's to stop you from

539
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,160
running that cool air in over one light

540
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,930
over another light to get heated up then

541
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,790
through that blower then through your

542
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,610
shroom cloud so that you're catching any

543
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:32,279
pathogens or any bugs then into the room

544
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:34,349
that sounds like a lot of equipment but

545
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,690
if you insist on bringing that cooler in

546
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:38,969
that is the safest most efficient way to

547
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,289
do it so let's talk about that again so

548
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,789
you've got your opening for your air

549
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,139
intake I don't know where your air is

550
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,420
coming in from we're just gonna say you

551
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,490
drilled a 4-inch hole directly in the

552
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,789
wall so now you've got a 4-inch hole on

553
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,440
the inside of that wall I would staple a

554
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,329
hipa filter just big enough to cover

555
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,220
that 4-inch hole maybe an inch around

556
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:58,470
each side got a little square hipa

557
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,390
filter now I would take the ducting and

558
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,700
put it flush against that wall and duct

559
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,080
tape it to the wall torn any air has to

560
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,029
go right through that filter

561
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,549
right out of the house then you run that

562
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:10,019
ducting over to the light then you put

563
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:11,700
it at the end of the sealed white duct

564
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,109
then you put the other ducting at the

565
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,430
end of the sealed white duct and if

566
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,089
you've got another light repeat the

567
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,860
process

568
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,539
repeat for as many lights as you've got

569
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,889
the more the merrier in this process

570
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,450
because now we're trying to heat up the

571
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,110
air and we're going to use the bulbs to

572
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,019
do so

573
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:27,149
so daisy chain those [ __ ] up then at

574
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,970
the end you've got your blower you need

575
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,980
your blower blowing toward the air sucks

576
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,470
through all of that ducting into the

577
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,700
room this is a very rare case most of

578
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,980
the time I want to blow the air out of

579
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,170
the room this time we're sucking the air

580
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,390
into the room then you've got your

581
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,480
4-inch blower at the open end of that I

582
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,430
would put that shroom dust cover so that

583
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,529
anything that made it past that hipa

584
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,480
filter that goes over the lights goes

585
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,399
down the line does not make it into the

586
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,279
grow it gets caught by that shroom

587
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,720
filter then in the warmer months all you

588
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,089
have to do is take off that shroom

589
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,069
filter and spin your blower around I

590
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,779
would replace the shroom filter with a

591
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,129
carbon filter at this point so now you

592
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,379
were going through the carbon filter

593
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,690
through the blower and pushing the air

594
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,640
out of the grow room this will work to

595
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,809
remove the heat and remove the humidity

596
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,720
and you've still got your four inch

597
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,190
passive duct bringing fresh air in again

598
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,769
make sure you put either that shroom

599
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,299
cover a cheap HEPA filter or even some

600
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,430
pantyhose over that so you don't bring

601
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:26,099
any crap in but this is a very

602
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:29,070
affordable and very effective seasonal

603
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,509
grow room adjustment being in Canada you

604
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:32,279
may be able to leave it set up for the

605
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,839
cold temperature all the time but you

606
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,879
may need to flip back and forth

607
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,619
occasionally you've already got the

608
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,630
four-inch blower running a little bit of

609
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:41,609
ducting won't be a challenge then all

610
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,830
you really need is probably a shroom

611
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:45,779
cover or a HEPA filter or some pantyhose

612
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,269
and then when you turn it around to blow

613
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,339
the air out I highly recommend a carbon

614
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,200
filter I don't know your location I

615
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,000
don't know your situation you may be

616
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,799
able to just blow that stink air right

617
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,079
out of the room and laugh at everybody

618
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,970
as they smell your skunky aroma I don't

619
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,470
know if that's acceptable if not I

620
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,079
certainly recommend the carbon

621
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,210
filtration so the short answer is this

622
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,159
is all based on the outside temperature

623
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,380
and the temperature of the air which you

624
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,810
plan on bringing into the grow room if

625
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,090
that air is too cold I would heat it

626
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,859
before it enters the room if that air is

627
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,589
the right temperature go ahead and bring

628
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:20,619
it in

629
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:22,720
but be sure to filter it in some sort of

630
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:24,939
a way we really don't want to invite

631
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,620
bugs we don't want to invite problems

632
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,450
and bringing air we spent all this time

633
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,069
and money to build a really nice grow

634
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,049
room and now we're just basically gonna

635
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:33,609
knock a hole and invite [ __ ] right

636
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,440
through that hole I kind of don't like

637
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,869
that idea so if it is preventable I

638
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,880
would not do that I understand sometimes

639
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,509
we are forced to work with what we've

640
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,550
got

641
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,799
you mentioned that this grow is in the

642
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,079
garage instead of running that duct from

643
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,940
the outside can you run that duct into

644
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,210
the house so you were just pulling

645
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:55,150
ambient air from the living area into

646
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,819
your grow space because that air in your

647
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,000
living area is probably more suitable

648
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:04,509
than that Canadian cold air outside and

649
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,630
it is also probably less likely to

650
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,980
contain pests or pathogens so that is

651
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,290
another option that you may explore

652
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,870
again I don't know your full situation

653
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,849
maybe you can't put a duct coming from

654
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,399
the house you could probably make it

655
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:20,859
look very inconspicuous since it's just

656
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
a four inch duct if you ran that duct

657
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,939
into the house somewhere and maybe put

658
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,799
it to where it draws air from either the

659
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,549
bathroom or the laundry room or the

660
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,649
kitchen area

661
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:32,230
you could probably disguise it to look

662
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,570
like part of the already existing house

663
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,730
airflow it could look like it is a dryer

664
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:38,919
vent or maybe an air-conditioning vent

665
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,049
that is supposed to be there most people

666
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,519
won't even notice most people that do

667
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,589
notice won't suspect there's anything

668
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,690
new if it looks like it's supposed to be

669
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:49,240
there all right I hope all of those

670
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,460
options and all of that input gave you

671
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,440
some useful information I do not

672
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,840
recommend blowing that frosty cold

673
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,700
Canadian air across those plants it will

674
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,889
bring out some beautiful colors but it

675
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,470
will give you powdery mildew conditions

676
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,960
too cold air blowing on the plants will

677
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,819
slow your growth rapidly and you just

678
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,819
will not be satisfied with the overall

679
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:11,470
condition of your finished product you

680
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:13,059
did not say if I can use your name in

681
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,009
