16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,820
start this podcast off by talking about

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,919
what I'm smoking my friend Jason was

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,350
super important to everybody at the

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,239
Green Dot labs team he was what my

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,700
friend just called a what did he call a

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,709
a coal and the fire for Green Dot labs

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,149
if you needed a motivator if you needed

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,780
somebody to cheer you up and get you

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,329
[ __ ] started Jason was the dude so

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,129
today I got myself some Green Dot labs

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,530
concentrates I may have gone a little

27
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,179
bit overboard if Green Dot has it

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,670
available right now I am probably

29
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,819
smoking some of it in honor of our boy

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,640
Jay so big [ __ ] stupid sighs

31
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,769
ridiculous Green Dot dabs for our buddy

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,689

33
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,670

34
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,099
bro I hope you're catching the clouds

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,710
I'm blowing your way now let's move

36
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,599
forward we know what we're dabbing on

37
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,069
let's talk about this kid Jason was a

38
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,228
great guy he was a couple years older

39
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,728
than me and I call him a kid because he

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,409
was a [ __ ] kid at heart he knew how

41
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,200
to do business he knew how to take care

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,060
of [ __ ] but he wasn't burdened by

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,769
adulthood he didn't let all that

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,420
business [ __ ] he didn't let all the work

45
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,250
stuff it didn't slow him down it didn't

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,540
make a smile go away he was gonna make

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,728
sure that we had a positive attitude

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,649
that we had fun that everybody had what

49
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,060
they needed the work got done and then

50
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,469
everybody got a hug and a high-five at

51
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,030
the end of the day so he was a great

52
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,459
[ __ ] kid even though he was older

53
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,530
than me he was a good [ __ ] dude

54
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,798
one thing that I've mentioned about Jay

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,239
is positive attitude that dude you never

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,680
see him there are so many pictures of

57
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,750
him on Facebook that's another thing

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
that as a testament of how awesome this

59
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,680
kid was if you look at all of the

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,209
pictures on Facebook and everybody today

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,400
has posted ten pictures of this guy

62
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,830
everybody's got photos of him every

63
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,349
picture he has got a smile from

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,710
to ear the dude doesn't stop smiling he

65
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,599
beams love he beams kindness ah as a

66
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,820
grown adult sometimes we need advice

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,109
from friends and sometimes you're kind

68
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,569
of shy on who you're gonna ask advice

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,100
from from friends because most of my

70
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,870
friends are in the same industry as

71
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,909
myself this industry can be competitive

72
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,219
a lot of my friends including myself

73
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,740
have big [ __ ] man egos and we don't

74
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:42,300
want to ask other men for advice I never

75
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,920
felt shy or ashamed to just ask Jay for

76
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,960
some guidance like hey bro here's what's

77
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,669
happening what would Jason do and he'd

78
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,900
be like bro I would [ __ ] quit being a

79
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,459
[ __ ] and I would do it like this and

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
he's like you're right I knew that

81
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,700
that's what somebody needed to say to me

82
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,439
I just needed you to say it so he would

83
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,819
motivate you he would be positive with

84
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,819
you he would give you advice he was

85
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,709
filled with kindness and even if you

86
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,030
didn't see him for a while we lived it

87
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,590
quite a ways away from each other no

88
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,569
excuse sometimes we wouldn't see each

89
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,580
other for a while when we did see each

90
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,329
other it was one of those you know you

91
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,459
do the handshake

92
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,930
it's a handshake it's a fist bump and

93
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,520
then it turns into a man hug and then

94
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,610
you back up and he kind of high-five and

95
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,600
you just talk uh it was that the moment

96
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,970
we saw each other

97
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,519
his friendship was everlasting his

98
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,500
friendship was unconditional and that

99
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,030
unconditional love that unconditional

100
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,129

basically for the friendship that is the

132
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,009
first thing I would thank him for he was

133
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,719

segue into the next portion of my show

152
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,870
there's really no smooth segue out of

153
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,240
that last part so I'm just going to tell

154

you what I want to talk about this

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,329
brought me to thinking that medical

156
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:27,269
patients are basically pioneers and

157
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:29,729
cannabis community leaders my buddy

158
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:31,349
Jason was very well-spoken for the

159
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,180
cannabis community has been involved in

160
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,220
medical cannabis since I knew him that's

161
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,889
how I met him he was a huge part of the

162
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,479
Colorado cannabis medical and

163
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,550
recreational cannabis community he was a

164
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,469
big part of the concentrate community we

165
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,590
found that a lot of the people who were

166
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,550
using cannabis for medical purposes

167
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:49,349
concentrates work very well you could

168
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,540
take one dab and you can find great

169
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,220
relief where before he may have had to

170
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,790
smoke two or three bowls to get the same

171
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,460
relief so our boy Jay was a medical

172
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,590
patient and I believe he was partially a

173
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,799
pioneer he's been making concentrates in

174
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:06,478
Colorado since we were just coming since

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,009
the market was getting huge he was there

176
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,500
he was part of it he was one of the

177
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,240
pioneers he has earned that title and by

178
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,339
being such a good dude having such a

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,160
good heart being so outgoing he also

180
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,649
became a community leader everybody in

181
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,040
the Colorado cannabis community knows

182
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:25,949
who Jason is and I feel like every state

183
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,310
that has legalized or will legalize

184
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:32,519
medical cannabis will have a person like

185
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,829
Jason in their area in their demographic

186
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,370
we're all gonna have that like outgoing

187
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:40,800
charismatic super friendly business

188
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,538
minded family oriented

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,210
of a businessperson who is also a

190
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,189
patient and an activist and an advocate

191
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,049
and a lot of times those are the people

192
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,360
who help us get the medical marijuana

193
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,370
laws started and get things put in place

194
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,620
they're the ones who stand up for us at

195
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,720
City Council they're the people who do

196
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,639
their best to hold the city and counties

197
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,710
accountable when things go wrong and the

198
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,389
rules and regulations are backfired and

199
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,489
citizens rights and patients rights are

200
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,918
infringed upon those are the people who

201
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,900
do that type of work those people are

202
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,240
crucial to our team those people are

203
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,549
critical for our cause without those

204
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,189
people helping create the rules without

205
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,168
the people doing all of the petitioning

206
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,839
without the people doing all the City

207
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:24,149
Council work the growers the

208
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,310
dispensaries the trimmers all of that

209
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:29,370
stuff is useless so those people are

210
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,408
critical to our team the reason many of

211
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,870
those people are fighting so strongly to

212
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:36,810
legalize medical cannabis and to uphold

213
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,819
the rules and regulations the medical

214
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,949
cannabis gives patients those rights

215
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,199
that we are afforded by those laws the

216
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,960
reason they fight so strongly is because

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,870
cannabis is what they have found to help

218
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,329
keep them alive or comfortable or to

219
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,259
improve the quality of their lives in a

220
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,269
significant way

221
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,610
and that is why they are out there

222
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:59,189
fighting to legalize cannabis and to

223
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,560
uphold patient rights because they are

224
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,740
patients themselves they know firsthand

225
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,329
how well cannabis works to cure ailments

226
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,918
in their lives who knows what their

227
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,628
ailments are who cares as long as

228
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,758
cannabis is making it better we should

229
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:14,310
allow them to use it so that's why many

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,979
people become activists become advocates

231
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,129
they want to heal themselves and they

232
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:22,168
want to see that healing and that

233
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:25,199
improvement in life amongst other people

234
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,750
so many cannabis advocates and activists

235
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,819
are pioneers in their area is what I'm

236
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,969
discovering and that is because those

237
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,649
people have passion and a purpose they

238
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,599
are passionate about medical cannabis

239
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,629
because it is improving the overall

240
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,669
quality of their daily life maybe they

241
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,158
don't have as much pain maybe they are

242
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,649
able to eat maybe it makes the PTSD go

243
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,629
away maybe it makes this seizure stop

244
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,149
they are improving the quality of their

245
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,189
life they have got passion and with that

246
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,929
passion comes purpose

247
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,600
animus is not legal but it makes my

248
00:08:54,929 --> 00:09:00,179
ailments go away I need to do everything

249
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,009
I can to make cannabis available to

250
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,559
myself and other people with this

251
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,629
ailment and so now you have added some

252
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,029
purpose to that passion you have got

253

passion and you've got purpose you were

254

273

committed and how dedicated you are take

274
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,459
a couple of minutes tell a couple of

275
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,570
your friends that you love them and that

276
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,720
you're grateful that they're there

277
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,270
because at any minute they may not be

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,570
there so find your passion find your

279
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,970
purpose but still make a few minutes out

280
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,590
