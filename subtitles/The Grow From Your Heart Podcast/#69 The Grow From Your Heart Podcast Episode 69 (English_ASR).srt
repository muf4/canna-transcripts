before we get too far I do need to send

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,799
you guys a huge apology I know that

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,558
there was an issue with the last episode

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
I posted the stitcher but it has since

25
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,798
been corrected I'm drop down that music

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,478
a little bit I'm going to repeat that uh

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,680
the last episode I posted to Stitcher

28
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,798
went up it went to iTunes it went to

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,560
Stitcher it went to the website

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,560
everything went perfectly but for some

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,400
reason when Stitcher grabbed it it only

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,960
took the first uh 14 or 15 minutes of it

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,640
so for the first couple of days of the

34
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,919
week you guys were only able to access a

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,519
15minute episode right when the grow

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
lesson came in everything cut off I

37
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,478
apologize for that Stitcher got it fixed

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
it took him a couple of days but

39
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,599
Stitcher did repair that for me so big

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
shout out to Stitcher uh big thanks to

41
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,359
everybody who went back and listened to

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,759
that episode if you guys uh tried to

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,959
listen and gave up because it sucked uh

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
go back and the whole episode is there

45
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,879
now it's a 30-some minute episode we

46
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,718
cover most of veg growth so now that

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,239
that's out of the way let's uh move

48
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,839
forward with the show um I received a

49
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,718
question that I want to answer it'll be

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,640
real quick somebody asked me why do you

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,798
turn off the lights during your foler

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
feeding um

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,840
when I'm using a bug spray or a foler

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,560
feed I turn off the lights because um

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,080
when you spray the plants with a liquid

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,479
it makes little bubbles on there right

57
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,280
and then you've got these high-intensity

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,000
discharge lights right above them and it

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,479
works the same way as if you took a

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,598
magnifying glass and shown the sun

61
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,679
through it uh it makes that little I

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,719
call it a reflector bubble and the

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,239
magnifying glass and the sun work and it

64
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,159
makes that little dot on [ __ ] and then

65
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,800
it burns it it'll create you can catch

66
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,239
paper on fire when I was a kid I

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,599
remember we used to burn ants and [ __ ]

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,039
with the magnifying glass using the sun

69
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:35,399
uh the bubble on your plants will do the

70
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,560
exact same thing it'll create that

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,760
magnifier bubble the light will hit it

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,318
it'll intensify the light beam into one

73
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,719
spot on your plant and it will actually

74
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,039
create a little burn mark in your plant

75
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,199
so if you're using a f your feed or a

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,318
bug spray I fully recommend you turn off

77
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,399
the lights it's ideal to do it right

78
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,560
before the lights go out if you can but

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,599
sometimes uh we have jobs and [ __ ] that

80
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,080
prevent us from doing that so that is

81
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,639
why I turn off the lights when I F your

82
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,239
feed and that's why I recommend you turn

83
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,919
off the lights when you f your feed or

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,878
bug spray let's see what's going on in

85
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,679
my world um man I was at the spot

86
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,560
yesterday I spent a couple hours out at

87
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,200
the spot dispensary in PLO West and

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,439

89
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,399

it also before we get to the grow lesson

104
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,879
I wanted to talk about how much I feel

105
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,079
like my head is improving um if you guys

106
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,518
follow the show you know that at the

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
beginning of April I hit my head I had a

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,000
serious concussion um a few episodes at

109
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,119
the beginning of April mid April were a

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,799
little bit I'm going to say they were

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
shitty in my opinion I know they were

112
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,400
not up to uh the standard I've created

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,360
they did not follow the format that I've

114
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,599
created

115
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,079
but honestly uh I was not in my head I

116
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,000
was recovering from a major head wound

117
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,159
but the good part is I feel like I'm

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,799
getting my [ __ ] together um it's been a

119
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,840
week since I sat down to record and it

120
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,879
came together the recording equipment

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,439
came together easily my podcast notes

122
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,399
came together easily uh the notes that I

123
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,360
wrote last week I brushed them up and

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,439
made a lot more sense out of them so the

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
good part is I feel like I'm getting

126

about the flowering period I've alluded

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,959
that there are three trimesters to the

166
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,199
flowering period now let me explain a

167
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,198
little what I meant by that uh for this

168
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,560
we're going to talk about a 9we plant uh

169
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,079
nwe flowering plant uh we'll use

170
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Grateful Dog as an example because it

171
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,240
likes to finish in about nine weeks so

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,360
that's perfect uh the first trimester is

173
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,240
what I would refer to as the transition

174
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,919
phase uh the second trimester is full

175
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,960
flour uh and the finishing and the third

176
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,598
trimester is the finishing and ripening

177
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,000
phase so I'm going to try to talk a

178
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,240
little bit about what the plants want

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
during each trimester and I'll do my

180
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,639
best to kind of break it down week by

181
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,439
week for you and let you know what to

182
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,079
feed and what you can be doing to your

183
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,000
plants each week uh we'll find like the

184
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,478
main important things to do to your

185
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,360
plants each week and then I'll give you

186
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,318
some ideas that'll really improve your

187
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,840
crops and then in a future episode we're

188
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,879
going to focus all about improving your

189
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,638
crops so

190
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,759
let's get on it let's start a flowering

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,360
cycle today would be day one of week one

192
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,840
of flower so you I would start on a

193
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,120
Monday that's just my preference we've

194
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,079
talked about that I would go to that

195
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,399
Monday and I would say day one of flower

196
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,000
week one day one uh then I would go

197
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,279
through and Mark that calendar week two

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,959
week three week four week five week six

199
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,799
so that it's easily easily viewable all

200
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,120
right so you want to set the lights for

201
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,960
a 1212 cycle uh that means we want the

202
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,959
lights to be on for 12 hours and off for

203
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,598
12 hours of uninterrupted Darkness every

204
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,918
day and every night uh we can't have any

205
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,800
dark during the night cycle I can't

206
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,399
stress or any light during the night

207
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,759
cycle I can't stress how important it is

208
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,799
to have total darkness for the dark

209
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,319
period of your Bloom cycle the room

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,000
needs to be totally pitch black dark if

211
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,800
you can see any light in there it's too

212
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,598
much uh if you can stand in the room and

213
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,520
put your hand in front of your face if

214
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,878
you can see your hand at all you need

215
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,000
more darkness in there uh that's

216
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,520
completely important uh it's also uh

217
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
let's see where was I it's equally

218
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,000
important not to interrupt the dark

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,839
period uh interrupting the dark period

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
will cause your plants to possibly Herm

221
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,918
and possibly make seeds uh your plants

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,240
are asleep you want to let them sleep it

223
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,680
pisses you off when I wake you up in the

224
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,478
middle of the night it' piss your plants

225
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,478
off too so running a 1212 cycle I like

226
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,560
to keep my metal halide bulbs in for the

227
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,560
first two weeks of flowering for the

228
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,478
first week of flowering all right here

229
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,120
we go for the first week of flowering I

230
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,279
would feed my vegetative base nutrients

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,360
and I would start pumping up my pnk

232
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,918
values okay and I would also keep

233
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,560
focusing on root development a little

234
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,038
bit if I were using bottled nutrients I

235
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,639
would uh use a little bit of liquid

236
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,560
Karma some Silica Blast I would use a

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,800
little bit of humble honey and some

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,560
roots zho or something similar uh some

239
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,639
kind of similar rooting powder or maybe

240
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,000
some uh like uh what was I us before ogt

241
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,478
that works some great white shark Works

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
anything like that would work for you

243
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,038
and also maybe I would add in some

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
hydrozyme uh don't expect to see a whole

245
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,240
lot of action from the plants your first

246
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,959
week of flower uh this is the start of

247
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,200
the transitional period like like I said

248
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,838
this is Transitional phase from Veg to

249
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,599
bloom and then in about 6 to 10 days is

250
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,680
where you're really going to see your

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,879
changes so let me add something here

252
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,679
while I'm thinking about it your plants

253
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,838
are going to get fed nutrients uh on

254
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,879
every Monday but they're probably going

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,240
to get uh thirsty and need a drink

256
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,838
before the next Monday so it's probably

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,600
going to be Wednesday or Thursday but on

258
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,720
that day water your plants with just

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,159
clean water phed at

260
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,639
6.5 uh you don't want to feed every day

261
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,639
because then your plants are going to

262
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,120
start to get over fertilized and they

263
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,519
are going to get what we call nutrient

264
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,639
lockout all of your bottle nutrients are

265
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,480
salt based and if we keep feeding these

266
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,399
salts to our plants they get salty and

267
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,440
they don't want to take up more salts so

268
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,200
they simply stop taking up nutrients and

269
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
that's called nutrient lockout so we're

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,278
going to feed clean water every

271
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,039
Wednesday or Thursday and prevent that

272
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,879
nutrient lockout by giving these girls a

273
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,480
fresh drink so that's going to put us

274
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,639
into week two

275
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,240
for week two I would start feeding my

276
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,559
Bloom base nutrients and I would add

277
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,039
some cow mag I would add this is if

278
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,359
you're going to use bottle nutrients and

279
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,199
this is what I would use if I were using

280
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,200
liquid Karma if you're using a different

281
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,720
brand uh all of these products are

282
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,759
easily replaceable just look at your

283
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,480
feed chart and look at your the other

284
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,439
brand and replace the bottles it'll be

285
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,839
that easy so uh for week two I would do

286
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,720
some calmag some liquid Karma Silica

287
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
Blast and I would add a little bit of

288
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,519
clex uh week two is where you really

289
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,958
need to start paying attention for m

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
plants if you started from seeds you're

291
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,719
going to start seeing uh little ball

292
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
sacks develop if you've got males in

293
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,360
there get them out uh in week two you

294
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,078
should start seeing pre- flowers and the

295
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,240
plants are starting to stretch by the

296
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,958
end of this week you should have

297
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,879
identified your males and isolated them

298
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,278
if you don't plan on breeding uh

299
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,519
definitely get those males out of there

300
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,039
cut them down uh if you put them in the

301
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,440
garage they may keep going if you put

302
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,759
them somewhere they may keep going and

303
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,800
make pollen kill them cut them down kill

304
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,000
them uh unless you plan on breeding and

305
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,078
if you plan on breeding then I don't

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,159
need to tell you what to do with males

307
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,399
you've already got that figured out so

308
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,799
for week two they're pretty much just

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,078
going to grow uh you're going to start

310
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,679
seeing flowering Set uh flower sets

311
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,159
start to develop you'll start to see the

312
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,439
sex uh if you're using femin seeds still

313
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,759
pay attention to the sex you may get

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,079
some Herm hermaphrodites some [ __ ] could

315
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,439
have gone wrong you may have gotten the

316
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,399
wrong seeds you never know pay attention

317
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,040
don't take that feminized label as the

318
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,000
complete this will be a perfect female

319
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,559
plant that could not be the case all

320
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
right so week three week three is a busy

321
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,559
week this is where we really start

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,559
getting busy you should have identified

323
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,278
your males by now uh you should have

324
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,759
pulled them hopefully if you had clones

325
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,439
of those you tossed the Clones of the

326
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,838
males also so uh if you don't have nice

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Bud sights developing by the beginning

328
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,519
of week three you may have a light leak

329
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,319
or another issue during your dark period

330
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,959
uh if you're not starting to see little

331
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,600
dandelion looking buds sits by now go in

332
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,159
the room at night and make sure you're

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,959
not getting a light leak a small light

334
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,838
leak will prevent your your plants from

335
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,799
going into flower so for week three

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,079
I would feed my Bloom base nutrients I

337
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,719
would feed calag I would introduce

338
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,039
fulvex I would use Liquid Karma I would

339
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,160
use

340
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,838
hydroplex uh clex Silica Blast humble

341
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,120
honey and hygrozyme this week uh this

342
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,000
will be the basic recipe through

343
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,759
flowering minus the hygrozyme I only

344
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,519
hygrozyme every other feed now I do add

345
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,879
a few other things to my personal mix

346
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,919
but uh this will get you guys through

347
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,159
flowering I don't want to get too crazy

348
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,240
and have you buying a whole bunch of

349
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,958
things when you're not ready for that so

350
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,480
I did get this mix from the Botanicare

351
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,479
website uh if you need help mixing up a

352
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,519
great Botanicare recipe just go to the

353
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,159
Botanicare website go to the Nutrient

354
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,639
calculator uh basically fill it in it

355
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,039
asks how many weeks you want a veg how

356
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,560
many weeks you want to flour it asks you

357
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,399
which bottles of nutrients you've got

358
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,319
you click on those and it'll tell you

359
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,198
what to feed I would recommend reducing

360
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,399
it just a little bit uh feed your plants

361
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,399
a reduced mix and see how they react you

362
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,639
can always feed more but you can't unfed

363
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,799
your plants once they've burned

364
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,480
themselves

365
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,000
so don't overdo it uh they do I like

366
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Botanicare I like the company but they

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
are a company they need you to buy more

368
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,759
so they kind of tell you to use a little

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,759
bit extra is my opinion the more you use

370
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,240
the sooner you got to buy another bottle

371
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,120
anyway let's talk more about week three

372
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,600
um yeah you can go get that on the

373
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,480
Botanicare website is where I left off

374
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,079
right all right if you're using a

375
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,680
different brand they do have a different

376
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,479
feeding chart online for you to follow

377
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,239
uh almost all the popular brands have a

378
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,759
feeding chart right now and you can

379
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,440
easily like I said you can easily swap

380
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,439
out bottle for bottle if you know if you

381
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
just read like I said liquid Karma read

382
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,519
the bottle see what's in there look at

383
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,198
whatever brand you're using and there's

384
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,399
the equivalent for your brand is there

385
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,639
it's all basically the same [ __ ] I just

386
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,000
prefer Botanicare if I'm going bottled

387
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,959
NES all right so I also like to add a

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,039
nice dose of carbs and sugars at week

389
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,319
three um we're going to start seeing

390
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,519
resin production around week uh midweek

391
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,079
three early week four you'll very little

392
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,600
resin production but it will start and

393
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,120
why not give it some carbs and sugars to

394
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,879
start contributing to that that's my op

395
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,360
opinion and I also think that carbs and

396
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,120
sugars keep the MOs in your root Zone

397
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,639
living and healthy and happy so that is

398
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,039
always a good idea to add those guys so

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,519
in week three we should really see Bud

400
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,039
sights developing this is a good time to

401
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
start lollipopping your plants what that

402
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,439
means is kind of cleaning up the bottom

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
uh little mini Buds and the sucker

404
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
branches that aren't going to get enough

405
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
light to become viable buds just get in

406
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,600
there and clean that [ __ ] right out

407
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,159
don't be afraid um we'll do a whole

408
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
lesson on lollipopping if we haven't

409
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,879
already you want to get in there light's

410
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,000
only going to P penetrate your canopy

411
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,838
about 18 to 20 maybe 24 in uh if you're

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,879
using regular th000 watt bulbs if you're

413
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,600
using lower wattage you've got even less

414
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,320
penetration so you're going to want to

415
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
get in there if your plant's 3ot tall

416
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,120
you don't need a whole 3ft stock you

417
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
want to kind of clean off the bottom 12

418
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,399
inches or so and that gives you more air

419
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,519
flow down there those buds that develop

420
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,198
down there are just going to be wispy

421
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,440
[ __ ] anyway unless you're going to make

422
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,719
hash with it clean that up send all that

423
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,839
energy up to the top of the plant

424
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,079
because you don't want to waste time

425
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,560
time trimming that bottom [ __ ] anyway so

426
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,679
we're g to lollipop clean up the

427
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,879
bottoms um also I would recommend

428
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,278
switching from metal HDE bulbs to high

429
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,360
pressure sodium bulbs at the start of

430
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,399
week three week three is the last week

431
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,480
of the first trimester and it's the last

432
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,639
week of the transition and stretching

433
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,639
phase so after this week your plants

434
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,360
will quit stretching so much week three

435
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,198
is really the super stretch and then

436
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,800
week four they'll quit stretching and

437
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,599
start working more on buds for you so in

438
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,039
week three you want a lollipop

439
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,519
and you want to change to your high

440
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,879
pressure sodium bulbs are your main

441
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,639
goals for week three and guys I know I'm

442
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,519
going kind of fast but we got nine weeks

443
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,000
to cover here and I'm only to week four

444
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,560
and we're 15 minutes in already

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,240
so uh week four I'm going to feed a very

446
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,879
similar mix that I would in week three

447
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,720
uh week four is the end of the stretch

448
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,078
phase and the start of actual bud growth

449
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,399
you'll really start to see buds

450
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:25,838
developing by now and if you don't

451
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,399
you've got a problem we need to get in

452
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,920
there and make sure you've got Darkness

453
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,639
make sure you don't have some shitty PL

454
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,078
so uh uh week four is another week to

455
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,720
lollipop you can definitely get in there

456
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,159
and lollipop a little bit more I just

457
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,720
use my thumbnail I don't trim my

458
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,318
thumbnail all the way down I just use

459
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,600
that to pick off those little sucker

460
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,360
buds uh collect them up put them in a

461
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,639
little trash can and toss them those are

462
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,159
or put them in the compost pile if

463
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,240
you're doing that those little sucker

464
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,039
buds are just that they're just little

465
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,000
suckers they all that energy could go up

466
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,318
to the top of the plant if you guys are

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,078
growing for just hash you could do

468
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,479
whatever you want with that I get it so

469
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,638
um now it's also a good time to start

470
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,199
adding steaks or some sort of supports

471
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,318
to the branches cuz we're going to get

472
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,039
some Hefty Buds and once we get into

473
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,639
week five and six we're really going to

474
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,439
need Stakes to support everything but by

475
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,360
week five and six it's such a [ __ ] to

476
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,160
maneuver those plants uh your branches

477
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,680
got long sticky colas on there and you

478
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,240
don't want to be playing with the resin

479
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,399
and getting the resin all over your

480
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
clothes you want to leave that on the

481
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,159
plant so get in there about week four

482
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,680
and I like to put a stake to support the

483
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,399
middle Cola cuz I know I'm going to have

484
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,559
a big huge fat Cola then I like to put

485
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,879
about four maybe six sticks around the

486
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,919
pot because I'm going to get some big

487
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,120
colas and I use those sticks to strap up

488
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,799
my major colas just right to the stick

489
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,278
and I do it early because like I'm

490
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,838
saying in week five and six I'm going to

491
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,399
have some buds going on that I don't

492
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
want to have to mess with so much and if

493
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,240
I got them all strapped up already I

494
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,000
don't have to worry about it when I'm

495
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,959
working with soil plants I usually don't

496
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,078
use a trellis or a screen or anything

497
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,039
but at the uh the dispensary where I'm

498
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,198
running the big row we are definitely

499
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,120
using a trellis and if you're going to

500
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,278
Trellis the you need to get that in

501
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,078
there during your veg cycle that's why

502
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,000
when I was doing the veg lesson I

503
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,519
mentioned that this is the week to do

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,558
any type of trellising and [ __ ] like

505
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,639
that that'll have to happen in veg you

506
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,720
guys because those plants are going to

507
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,160
grow up into that trellis and you don't

508
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,360
want to be bending them and folding them

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,679
and manipulating them in flower so you

510
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,318
have to be prepared for that that's why

511
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,798
we're making a schedule now before we

512
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,000
put these plants in the dirt or in the

513
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,199
Rockwall cubes so get your staks up you

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,558
guys water healthy get your staks up

515
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,440
more lollipopping that's what you're

516
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,678
doing for week four let's transition

517
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,759
into week five now this is when the fun

518
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,519
starts you guys the plants start getting

519
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,919
photogenic the buds start getting chunky

520
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,160
uh since we're getting chunky buds it's

521
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,919
a good time to stop foler feeding I

522
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,440
don't talk a lot about folar feeding I

523
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,000
will in the future um foler feeding can

524
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,279
lead to a lot of problems if it's done

525
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,319
incorrectly or at the wrong time so I

526
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,839
haven't introduced that yet but if you

527
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,759
have gone on your own and started foler

528
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,558
feeding week five is when I would

529
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,599
recommend you

530
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,678
quit uh it's also important to pay

531
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,678
attention to your humidity in week five

532
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,000
high humidity and big buds can be a

533
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,120
great way to create powdery mildew or

534
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
other mold related problems I'm sure you

535
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,158
guys that listen to the podcast they've

536
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,120
heard me talk about growing in a new

537
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,840
room I was in a basement I had a um

538
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,678
exterior wall Corner that got really

539
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,279
cold and that corner pocket right there

540
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,679
had a lot of cold air and I had a 5 O

541
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,440
White Rhino plant that I cut down and

542
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,480
discovered powdery mildew on one butt of

543
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,919
it as I was cutting it down and I threw

544
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
the entire plant away uh about probably

545
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,038
5 ounces worth of good cannabis

546
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,600
somewhere between four and 6 ounces is

547
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,798
what those plants were averaging so

548
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,000
those 5 ounces that my patients did not

549
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,440
get to enjoy because I let it get

550
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,599
powdery milw so pay attention to the

551
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,038
room don't let your room get too humid

552
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,199
uh my problem was that it was cold and I

553
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,000
was letting cold air mix with the warm

554
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
air and that created mildew in my room

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,880
um but I learned from it I learned a

556
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,439
whole lot that [ __ ] will never happen to

557
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,000
me again and guys if it happens to you

558
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,360
don't don't feel bad shit's going to

559
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,640
happen you just have to learn from it

560
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,798
it's how you deal with it is what makes

561
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,240
you the the grower so uh do your best to

562
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,839
get the humidity under control you don't

563
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,519
want too much humidity in there you do

564
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,038
not want to start getting mildew um for

565
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,279
week five I would recommend getting your

566
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:14,759
humidity right around 50% if you can get

567
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,399
it to 40 there's nothing wrong with that

568
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,599
um you don't want it too high that's

569
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,480
when you're going to get problems too

570
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,158
low of humidity your room's going to dry

571
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,000
up kind of quickly and the buds don't

572
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,880
get as sticky I don't think but uh if

573
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,038
you have the option or if you're stuck

574
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,559
with one if you have to go too high or

575
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,839
too low definitely go too low if you

576
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,038
make humidity so let's see we talked

577
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,480
about getting rid of the humidity I'm

578
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,038
reading notes as I do this um oh this is

579
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,679
where I would stop lollipopping you guys

580
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,798
week five don't lollipop anymore uh you

581
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,360
can if you want to but you should have

582
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:42,400
gotten all that taken care of by now and

583
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,399
you're just going to kind of shock the

584
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,840
plant if you keep doing it uh you may if

585
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,280
you keep lollipopping and [ __ ] with

586
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,279
the plant this far in you may cause it

587
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,720
to stress out and Herm just depends on

588
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,240
what other stress you're giv to the

589
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,240
plant so you should have a room full of

590
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,400
sexy chunky buds by now and they're

591
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,480
going to start falling over and needing

592
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,919
a attention so uh hopefully you've got

593
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,159
plenty of sticks in there you're in

594
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,120
there paying attention every day uh

595
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,080
you're going to go in there one day and

596
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,199
you're going to find a bud that you

597
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,639
didn't notice and it's going to be

598
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,240
straight sideways looking like it's

599
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,759
ready to break Don't Panic just get in

600
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
there and support it give it some

601
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,400
support that shit's going to happen to

602
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,038
you uh and you're going to learn all

603
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,360
these things over a couple of grows of

604
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,839
what to look for and you'll learn to

605
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,240
stop panicking when you see a problem

606
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,319
guys don't panic that's I know I keep

607
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,798
saying that but if you freak out you're

608
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,399
just going to make it worse when you see

609
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,720
a problem in the grow room just take a

610
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,759
minute it's a plant we can fix it

611
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,839
hopefully if not we'll just make BHO out

612
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,440
of it you're going to be okay so for

613
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,319
week five I like to add a really strong

614
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,080
dose of sugars and carbs uh one of my

615
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,720
favorite bottled products is humble

616
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,199
honey uh I use that at week three but I

617
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,400
use a nice fat dose of it again at week

618
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
five so for week five you want to make

619
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,159
sure you've got your supports in place

620
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,158
if you haven't done it in week four you

621
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,280
may need to add a few more sticks in

622
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,480
place for week five to get those bigger

623
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,079
buds up in place what I do I put a I

624
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,759
think it's a six foot tall bamboo stick

625
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,879
cuz I grow big plants you guys I put a

626
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,158
six foot tall bamboo stick uh toward the

627
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,320
outer edge of the plant because I don't

628
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,200
want to disrupt too much of the root I

629
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:15,079
just shove it right into there um then I

630
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
grab the bud that needs some support and

631
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,759
I use I've used several different things

632
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,639
but right now I'm using they call them

633
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,798
uh fuzzy sticks got them at Hobby Lobby

634
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,679
they had a whole bunch for really cheap

635
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,440
so I bought a [ __ ] ton of them it's kind

636
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,798
of like a uh it's a pipe cleaner

637
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,600
essentially it's like a really long red

638
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,639
tie that you can handle better so I just

639
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,278
take that and I wrap that right around

640
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,480
the stock of the bud that's going to

641
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,038
fall over and maybe maybe I'll do part

642
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
of the bud just depends on how heavy the

643
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,079
bud is if I feel like it'll break the

644
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,959
stick but then I take that and just wrap

645
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,759
it around the bud or the stock and wrap

646
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,038
that around the stick itself so that

647
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,000
it's just strapped right up to it like

648
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,759
you got a broken finger just give that

649
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,359
sucker some support you just don't want

650
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,640
it falling over and breaking it's your

651
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,839
whole goal uh maybe if you tip it a

652
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,480
little bit if it's at an angle it's a

653
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,558
good idea because then you can expose

654
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,880
more of that bud to the light and

655
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,678
instead of just having it completely up

656
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,720
and down if you tip it you get a little

657
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,559
more surface area for that light to hit

658
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,200
which will increase your

659
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,839
harvests so week five you want to work

660
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,278
on your supports you want to feed some

661
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,918
sugars and carbs you want to monitor

662
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,119
your humidity get it around 50 to 40%

663
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,278
and keep it there because you're going

664
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,918
to start uh getting chunkier buds and

665
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,000
you don't need mildew and you're going

666
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,000
to stop fol your feeding all right so

667
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,159
that's what's going to happen in week

668
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,679
five that's going to move us into week

669
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,600
six uh in week six I would feed a very

670
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,798
similar recipe as I did in week five I'd

671
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,599
use high amounts of pnk and lots of

672
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,599
sugars and carbs I would reduce my base

673
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,959
nutrients and focus on resin production

674
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,719
and healthy

675
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,720
plants uh week six will be our last full

676
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,120
feeding our Bud should be chunky and the

677
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,360
resin should be starting to cover the

678
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,359
buds and the small leaves uh if you're

679
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,918
growing a strain that purples up now is

680
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,678
a good time to lower the temps a few

681
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,520
degrees during the night cycles I try to

682
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,679
keep my Grow rooms about 77 or 74 to 77°

683
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,720
during the light period during the

684
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,320
period I try to get it down to about 68

685
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,919
69° at this point in week six if I'm

686
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,918
working with something that will purple

687
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,759
up a little bit like the kangi Kush or

688
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,360
the flo or the ghost OG or the Grateful

689
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:16,359
Dog I would drop the temps down just a

690
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,759
few more to like 65 degrees maybe 67 and

691
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,439
if you get to that 65 at night you'll

692
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,079
see it in a night or two those plants

693
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,840
will start to purple up the leaves will

694
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,558
turn purple for you um higher CBD plants

695
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,359
I think like more cold but that's just

696
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,599
my experience with the torab Bora and

697
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,798
the Night Nurse uh you may have a

698
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,319
totally different plant so don't take

699
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,599
that as a rule that's just my experience

700
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,399
so you might want to lower the temps

701
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,240
just a little bit if you're trying to

702
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,278
pull out the purples if you have more

703
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,359
sativa dominant plants uh th this would

704
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,400
probably piss off the Capleton the White

705
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,038
Widow would not like it lemon Jeffrey

706
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,240
would not like that don't put those in

707
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,640
the cold but cushy plants uh indic

708
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,480
dominant plants give them a little bit

709
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,480
of cold and they'll purple up for you

710
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,278
about week

711
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,240
six um you're going to have to use more

712
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,400
air conditioning so that may cost you a

713
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,000
little bit but I think it's worth it for

714
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,600
the plant that enjoys that so week

715
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,720
Seven's a great week for photography you

716
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,480
guys you got big chunky buds this is

717
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,200
however your last feeding so whatever

718
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,679
your plants are lacking or whatever you

719
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,759
haven't gotten in there this is probably

720
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,440
your last chance to do it we are going

721
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,038
to feed on week seven but we're not

722
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,360
going to feed the entire program we're

723
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,278
just going to give a little bit of stuff

724
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,240
to keep it alive and happy and healthy

725
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,558
so week six

726
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,759
uh basically work on a good feeding uh

727
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,960
lower your temps if you want make sure

728
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,919
you've got everything supported and

729
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,360
staked up make sure nothing Falls over

730
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,480
keep going through every single week you

731
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:42,678
guys and check for Herms check for males

732
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,000
check for issues uh I should say this

733
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,440
also every day if you can do it every

734
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,558
day go in your garden and grab each

735
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
plant and just grab one leaf and flip it

736
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,599
upside down and inspect the [ __ ] out of

737
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,359
it if you see any signs of bugs any

738
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,240
kinds of pests that's when we need to

739
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,678
get in there and really deal with it

740
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,759
hopefully you're not too far into Flower

741
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,399
by the time we discover a pest uh if

742
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,720
you're in flower when we discover pest

743
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,558
that's a whole another conversation

744
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,000
that's when you have to decide are these

745
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:09,599
pests going to ruin my garden before

746
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,919
Harvest time or can I eradicate these

747
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,199
pests somehow there are a lot of

748
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,520
decisions to make in that scramble mode

749
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,120
we'll talk about that in another episode

750
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:20,200
I do have a whole Pest Management

751
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:22,398
episode uh in the works so week six we

752
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,960
have uh lower the temps that's our last

753
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,558
big feeding we got chunky buds hopefully

754
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,960
he took a lot of pictures in week six

755
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,480
because week six is photogenic week

756
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,360
seven in this is when we start what I've

757
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,558
been calling the third trimester this is

758
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,519
ripening and the flush phase uh we won't

759
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,519
feed most of our nutrients this week I

760
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,359
would only use the humble honey for the

761
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,278
yucka extract and the sweetener in there

762
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,798
uh that's really going to make your

763
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,319
plant sweet it's going to make them DSE

764
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,599
up and it's going to make them taste

765
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:53,119
good and it's going to make them stanky

766
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,959
uh I would also use clex I think clex

767
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,599
really contributes to the aroma and

768
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,840
flavor of a Kush dominant plant a lot of

769
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,798
clex in cushy plants will bring out that

770
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,918
funk that feedy smell I really love it A

771
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,398
Grateful Dog loves

772
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,240
clex uh if you're grow and grateful dog

773
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,879
when you crack it open there's a an

774
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
offensive odor that comes out of it it's

775
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,399
almost foot-like it's almost armpit

776
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,640
likee and it has a scent of fuel to it I

777
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,839
think if you pump up the clex or a seelp

778
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,799
based product when you grow Grateful Dog

779
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,759
it will definitely increase that funky

780
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:29,440
ass turpine you're getting out of it so

781
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,359
we're using humble Honey C hydrozyme

782
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
also I like enzymes at this phase to

783
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,319
start breaking down uh dead material

784
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,599
dead roots that have maybe died and need

785
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,038
to be decomposed in there the hyro will

786
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,158
help eliminate that [ __ ] and speed

787
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,599
things along for the flush phase also

788
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,600
add some fulvex if you want to speed

789
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,038
things up and our friend Sean taught us

790
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,639
that you can use ogt to speed up the

791
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,480
flushing phase of your plants because

792
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,240
the rock phosphates make the plant cycle

793
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,360
too quickly it speeds up the nutritive

794
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,798
cycle so that will kind of assist us in

795
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,278
the flush phase if we like to I do not

796
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,158
use any of that [ __ ] like Final Phase or

797
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:06,919
clearex or any of that um I feel like

798
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,799
that stuff leaves a little bit of a

799
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,320
flavor in the plant and I also believe

800
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,759
that if we are growing properly and we

801
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,240
are flushing properly we don't need that

802
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,038
product that's just another product to

803
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,440
cell there is a science behind it like I

804
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,558
said earlier we are filling the plant

805
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,640
with salts and those flushing agents are

806
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,839
basically sugars and complex sugars

807
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,679
break down salts which would break the

808
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,879
bond of the salts around the N uh the

809
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,720
root base

810
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
which would allow uh cleaner absorption

811
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,480
of the roots and everything would just

812
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,039
taste better and it would flow better

813
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,399
but I don't think that they're necessary

814
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:40,278
unless you [ __ ] up at some point in

815
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,599
the grow so we're very close to harvest

816
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,558
time uh we really need to start getting

817
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,519
the excess nutrients out of our buds

818
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,319
before we cut them down and prepare them

819
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,519
so we need to start getting the nitrogen

820
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:54,720
the phosphorus the potassium the

821
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,919
maganese the uh calcium the Magnesium

822
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,399
all the [ __ ] that we've been shoving

823
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,919
into these plants we want to get it out

824
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:03,479
of there now

825
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,038
so um that moves us into week eight

826
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,679
excuse me week eight is the beginning

827
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,720
the official beginning of the flush

828
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,159
phase um what I like to do and this kind

829
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,240
of depends on your setup if you have

830
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,000
smaller pots you can move the pots to

831
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,079
the bathroom or the shower throw a

832
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,278
cinder block put something down so you

833
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,038
don't scratch up the bathtub or the

834
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,919
shower you guys put a towel down throw a

835
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,558
cinder block or a bucket right in the

836
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,480
bathtub or the shower and then if you're

837
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,440
using a three gallon pot I like to run

838
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,839
about 9 or 10 gallons of water right

839
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,880
through that pot I know that sounds

840
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,918
excessive but what you're doing you want

841
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,440
to wa you're washing the dirt you want

842
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,200
to get all of the nutrients that we've

843
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,360
poured into this plant through the past

844
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,679
seven weeks we need to rinse all that

845
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,079
[ __ ] out of the dirt now so and it's

846
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,960
also in the plant the plant has been

847
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,599
eating it so we have to kind of starve

848
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,038
the plant for the next two weeks if

849
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,119
you're using bigger pots it might not be

850
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,319
feasible or rational to drag them to

851
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,798
another room that's fine in a sgon pot I

852
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,278
usually pour about a gallon and a half

853
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:01,679
of water through it and just let it fill

854
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,640
up in that little tray and then I use a

855
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,960
shop vac a wet dry V to go suck the

856
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,519
water out of the trays I know that

857
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,440
sounds excessive but I really like to

858
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,720
clean out the plants if this method

859
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,200
doesn't work for you what you have to

860
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,360
really focus on when you're

861
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,240
flushing you want water to come out of

862
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,158
the bottom of the pot you need like if I

863
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,798
would like to say at least 10% of the

864
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,880
water I want to see that come back out

865
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:25,599
of the bottom that's how I know I'm

866
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,880
actually flushing that plant and pushing

867
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,678
something out if nothing's coming out of

868
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,640
the bottom nothing's coming out

869
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,240
you got to get water to flow to get all

870
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,038
those nutrients out and you're going to

871
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,679
want to do that without drowning your

872
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,919
plant you're going to want to flush it

873
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,278
let it kind of dry and then flush it

874
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,640
again as many times as we can until the

875
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,640
end of week nine so the week eight is a

876
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,559
start of flushing you're probably going

877
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,960
to water the [ __ ] out of it on Monday

878
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:51,119
it's not going to be ready for water

879
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,558
again until probably Thursday or Friday

880
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,678
because you watered it so

881
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,000
heavily um don't be in too much of a

882
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,278
rush to water it again because you will

883
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,798
drown the damn plant so Thursday or

884
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,319
Friday when you water it again do the

885
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,038
same thing lots of water just lots of

886
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,480
water just let it go right on through

887
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,000
just let it drain right on through if

888
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,200
you've got like a floor drain or

889
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,759
something just keep pouring water

890
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,000
through you can't over flush in my

891
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,480
opinion it's ideal to use three

892
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,079
times uh the volume of the pot so if

893
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,399
you've got a nine gallon pot or a three

894
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,918
gallon pot you want to use nine gallons

895
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,678
of water if you got a 5 gallon pot you

896
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,360
want to put 15 gallons of water through

897
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,559
that [ __ ] right is that what I said 5

898
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,918
gallon pot 15 G water three times yeah

899
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:33,000
just making sure I'm doing good math

900
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,440
here head injuri is coming back all

901
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,079
right so flush really good you guys I

902
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,038
[ __ ] a lot about cannabis because it's

903
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,720
improperly flushed um when you're

904
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,798
smoking a joint if the joint won't stay

905
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,679
lit if you have to keep relighting it

906
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,359
there's a good chance it wasn't flush

907
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,600
properly or I rolled it and I don't roll

908
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:51,759
with of [ __ ] but if your ashes are black

909
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,519
and chunky there are still nutrients in

910
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,839
there you want a nice clean white ash

911
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,359
that's nice and smooth and soft you

912
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,678
don't want chunks of it if you Ash into

913
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,798
your hand it should feel nice you should

914
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,480
almost enjoy that nice smooth texture of

915
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:08,079
the ashes if your plants were flushed

916
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,720
properly um one of my biggest complaints

917
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,960
about dispensary cannabis and I am

918
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,120
trying to fix this in my shop uh they

919
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,278
don't flush they do not flush and they

920
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,759
do not cure they pretty much say shit's

921
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,720
done cut it down and sell it and I don't

922
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,960
like that so we're going to try to

923
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,679
change that where I'm working uh

924
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,880
flushing is important you guys I can't

925
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,519
stress that so from week eight you want

926
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,559
to flush run plenty of clean water

927
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,759
through that pot week nine flushing is

928
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:35,480
in full effect uh week nine ends at day

929
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,200
63 on day 60 here's what I recommend go

930
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,759
in the grow room and start taking off

931
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,519
all of the big fan leaves any leaf that

932
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,440
has a pedial that's a stem you guys any

933
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,079
leaf that has a stem that you can get to

934
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,080
take some scissors and cut that [ __ ] off

935
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,000
really close to the bud just go in there

936
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,879
and de Leaf the entire room you don't

937
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,240
need these leaves anymore this is going

938
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,480
to save you time when it comes to

939
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,359
harvest so day 60 you walked in there

940
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,798
and you took off all of those leaves

941
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,199
boom

942
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,679
now this may sound crazy this is what I

943
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,120
do in my grows I've got three days left

944
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,519
right on the first on day 61 I reduce my

945
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,719
lights from 12:12 to 10:14 I'm on for 10

946
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,599
hours and I'm off for 14 the plants are

947
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,159
going oh [ __ ] he's going to kill us now

948
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,839
the time is near they know it the next

949
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,039
day I'll drop him down to eight hours

950
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:25,240
and on day three I'll give him 24 hours

951
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:27,079
of total darkness so day 63 no light at

952
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,679
all I'll leave them off for the entire

953
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,798
day

954
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,000
day 64 wake up bright and early nice and

955
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,558
ready go in and cut down the entire room

956
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,240
and just let them hang that's Harvest

957
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,879
day that's 63 or 64 days you guys nine

958
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,159
weeks of full flow I got through that in

959
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,480
30 minutes I did have to kind of I did

960
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,440
have to kind of skip a couple of details

961
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm going to take a drink I'm sorry I'm

962
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,278
trying to talk right through this but I

963
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,359
got a throat thing let me take a drink

964
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,119
here all right that's a little better I

965
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,319
got you guys through 9 weeks and 30

966
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,918
minutes I left some stuff out but I feel

967
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,319
like that leaves me more [ __ ] to teach

968
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,519
you guys and more tips tips to give you

969
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,759
in the future you'll survive a crop with

970
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:04,319
everything I taught you um something

971
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,200
that I should mention if you do grow a

972
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,119
longer strain I would recommend reducing

973
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,960
the light to 11 hours on and 13 hours

974
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,558
off around week nine this is only if

975
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,480
you're growing something that takes 11

976
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,240
weeks or more um some sativas won't

977
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,599
finish up without a short and day period

978
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,798
the reason is they are from an area that

979
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,439
only have a few hours difference in the

980
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,359
natural day and night cycle so we need

981
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,919
to encourage them excuse me I just

982
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,798
burped right into the microphone we need

983
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,080
to encourage these plants to finish up

984
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,599
by shortening the days uh what happens

985
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,918
when we shorten the days is the plant

986
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:43,480
realizes that winter is coming and our

987
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,000
plant's main goal is to pollinate and

988
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,440
create seeds and since it hasn't

989
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,480
received any pollen it's kind of being

990
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,798
stubborn about finishing it's like H I

991
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,319
really think it's like a dude at a party

992
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:55,158
it thinks if it hangs out late enough

993
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:56,879
there's still a chance of getting laid

994
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,240
so what we got to do is we got to start

995
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,399
messing with the lights and tell these

996
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,038
guys your time's up dude we got to turn

997
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:03,278
tell the girls actually we got to turn

998
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,919
the lights down and they'll start

999
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,599
finishing on their own otherwise some of

1000
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,918
these sativas will just keep on going I

1001
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,719
had a Durban Poison strain that went for

1002
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,078
14 weeks and then I was getting tired of

1003
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,000
that [ __ ] because I needed the room and

1004
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,399
it was I was done growing that strain

1005
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,559
and that crop and it wouldn't finish and

1006
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,838
then I thought well why don't I just

1007
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,358
reduce the lights down a little bit and

1008
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,320
speed this up and you know within one

1009
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,440
week of reducing the lights it finished

1010
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,200
I just had to tell it so

1011
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,480
so also you may want to feed for a

1012
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,678
little bit longer if you're running a

1013
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,440
longer plant I would extend the week six

1014
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,800
regimen if you have to extend anything

1015
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,519
uh just repeat week six uh until you get

1016
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,440
to the like if you have three extra

1017
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,398
weeks just do week six three extra times

1018
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,159
that's what I'm trying to say here guys

1019
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,679
