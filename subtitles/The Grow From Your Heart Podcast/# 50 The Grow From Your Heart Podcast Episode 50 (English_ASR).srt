00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,679
for uh I may have grown a couple of

223
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,198
theirs but I I've taken credit for those

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
so this is kind of a random note a lady

225
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,319
messaged me on in Instagram and kind of

226

227
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,199
I'm sure I said this but I don't

228
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,478
remember the exact words in an older

229
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,478
episode I kind of tried to cover my ass

230
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,120
legally with a disclaimer like if you

231
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,199
live in an illegal State don't grow weed

232
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,240
follow the rules and all that [ __ ] I got

233
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,840
to say that kind of [ __ ] to cover my ass

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
uh I don't know technically if I come on

235
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,799
the air and I say hey if you live in

236
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,239
Florida [ __ ] all the rules grow all the

237
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
weed you can I don't know if I'm going

238
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,680
to get in trouble for that so to cover

239
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,439
my own ass I just say follow the follow

240
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,680
the rules you guys but I think that you

241
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,000
should grow your own cannabis if you're

242
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,120
smoking cannabis if you're consuming

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,879
cannabis if you like it recreationally

244
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,639
if you like it medically grow the [ __ ]

245
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,158
out of it everywhere that's my new

246
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,400
stance on it overgrow the government

247
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,439
they can't arrest us all they might

248
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,239
arrest me for saying that but if they do

249
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,639
somebody else make a badass podcast and

250
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
keep this going for me and and I mean if

251
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,000
you are going to do

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,399
it illegally you know if you do it

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,439
somewhat responsibly and you're willing

254
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
to go to court for that then so be it I

255
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,598
mean you may be the change that your

256
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,639
state or your community yeah your

257
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,079
community is needed so plant more seed

258
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,680
you guys grow more weed I can't be a

259
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,000
hypocrite I grow a lot of cannabis I

260
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,879
think you should too but also know the

261
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,879
risks if you've got kids in the house

262
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,759
you can lose the kids

263
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,360
when they're going to shoot your dog

264
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,479
most likely when they come in the door

265
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
think about that kind of [ __ ] it's going

266
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
to be traumatizing it's going to [ __ ] up

267
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
your life if you're prepared for that if

268
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,399
you can handle that if you're a man

269
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,680
Andor woman enough if you're transgender

270
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,440
enough I'm not trying to exclude anybody

271
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,838
I'm trying to include all of you if you

272
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,160
are person enough and you can handle

273
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,200
that [ __ ] grow cannabis do your thing

274

325
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,319

326
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
would have jacked it security so so

327
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,200
shout out to that lady that kind of

328
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,440
called me out I guess I might have been

329
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,759
hypocritical but honestly encourage any

330
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,320
of that I was just trying to cover my

331
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,639
own ass is all I'm trying not to go to

332
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,519

334
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,278
Texas to grow weed and not think that

335
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,439
I'm going to get in trouble but guess

336
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,240
what if you're in Texas grow some

337
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
[ __ ] weed dude grow it grow it with

338
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
all your heart I would I would think

339
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
it'd be easy to uh figure out what our

340
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,799
opinion was but right yeah I don't think

341
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,479
you really off a role model Vibe is more

342
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,278

343

information out there for people yeah

344
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,278
yeah well she called me out and I I

345
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,120

346
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,759

414
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,759
and you keep us updated with our local

415
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,600
politics and the local [ __ ] that we need

416
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,360
to be aware of and I think that

417
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,680
reminding us about our local stuff

418
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,159
teaches our listeners that they can

419
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,198
participate too and it gets them off the

420
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,759
couch which is what we need you can be

421
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,359
an activist in so many ways but you got

422
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,319
to off the couch to do be ready to do

423
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,639
local political work if marijuana is

424
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,440
getting legalized in your state as soon

425
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,600
as it's legal at the state level all

426
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,199
sorts of nightmarish work begins at the

427
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,199
local level with the city and county

428
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,359
level and if you don't have somebody in

429
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,078
your crew ready to step up on that it's

430
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,519
not going to go the way you want it to

431
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,039

legal reasons these prizes are available

States unless you're here at the table

524
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,959

525
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,159
the show by the way I make the [ __ ]

526
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,318
rules and they can change any time I

527
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,679
decide they change mad jealous for that

528
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,240
the prize packs are sick guys I don't

529
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
even remember where I was headed with

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,318
that yeah anyway anybody can get the

531
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,240
prizes um yeah so there can't be seeds

532
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,838
in there that's what I was saying there

533
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,160
can't be seeds in there I'm sorry I will

534
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,879
make a Colorado local contest where I

535
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
can put some I seeds in there eventually

536
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,000
I just got to figure out how to do that

537
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,599
it'll just be a local thing so yeah big

538
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,519
shout out to all those guys dude MD you

539

540
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,079
need to be podcasting all the time thank

541
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,240
you yeah you're nice well I have a we

542
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,839
have a discussion table every night when

543
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,400
we take dabs we usually just have a

544
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,439
session sit down and talk for an hour or

545
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,880
two and just [ __ ] and honestly it

546
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
could be on a podcast so that's why I've

547
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,360
said it before on the show that your

548
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,400
table is part of what inspired this

549
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,199
podcast

550
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,080
uh your guys's friend uh I won't say his

551
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,159
name he used to come and pick my brain

552
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,639
for 2 hours at a time at your table and

553
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,520
then I thought I should record all this

554
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,520
a write it down and just refer him to my

555
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,240
recordings I wish I could just bring

556
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,879
thoughts back that I have like I

557
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,640
remember something we were talking about

558
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,880
but I don't remember the specifics uh

559
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,880
one time on an older podcast that I used

560
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,960
to do uh shout out to 719 the blocks uh

561
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,840
on that podcast we had a recording issue

562
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
and our whole recording got lost and we

563
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,279
decided let's just try to redo it and

564
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,759
mimic it about 10 minutes in we're like

565
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,119
this feels so fake there's no way to

566
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,919
bring back those thoughts in that

567
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,639
conversation so we just gave up we're

568
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,559
like no so remaking a talk isn't it's

569
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,520
not the most legit thing we've sat here

570
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,480
and tried to make a podcast four or five

571
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,359
times in one night and it just didn't

572
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,240
work time and time was about episode 13

573
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,158
or 15ish around that area was cut

574
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
everything's better when it's not forced

575
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,600
yeah I just I wasn't feeling it like it

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,279
was time to record and I just wasn't in

577
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,240
the mood and now I'm I'm way more

578
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,038
comfortable at it so did 5050 episodes

579
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,599
in on this show and then I did a about

580
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,359
50 with another show also so I've had

581
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,759
some time to get comfortable yeah I've

582
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,119
only been a host for 50 episodes I feel

583
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,240
like I've only been a host for about 30

584
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,719
episodes to tell you the truth it took

585
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,720
me 20 25 to get there it flew by yeah

586
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,120
yeah uh I'm thinking about doing more

587
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,558
frequent episodes because we get more

588
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,959
listens when they're more frequent but I

589
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,759
don't want to bore people also I don't

590
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
want to be that podcast information

591
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,000
disappears for three months and then

592
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,120
comes out with the show and then comes

593
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,159
out and so few of those apologizes but

594
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,839
then I also don't want you to have to

595
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,200
listen to me four times a week like Jo

596
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,079
Rogan cuz I don't even have time to hear

597
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,240

[Music]

602

that have passed on genetics you know

614
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,720
it's kind of now it's kind of something

615
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:14,519
that should be done now is you know kind

616
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,679
of share the genetics for people um

617
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,960
there's always going to be Cuts people

618
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,080
are going to hold that's just how it

619
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,360
works but you could still share at the

620
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,359
same

621
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:29,359
time sharing is um great

622
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,400
here no it's all good I just tried to

623
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,279
step in somebody was had to do something

624
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,759
here but go to take a dab and all just

625
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:41,000
look atly for my carb cap was clogged so

626
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,038
I was [ __ ] choking on it too that was

627
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,440
weak good man I'm going clean that out a

628
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,599
little bit the sharing is good here in

629
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,640
Colorado got to keep clean yeah try not

630
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,759
to be a a clone hoarder and I know

631
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,440
that's hypocritical because I'm a

632
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,960
breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder

633
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,480
everybody's going to keep your special

634
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,000
genetics but everybody's got those

635
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
couple that if you got something that's

636
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,279
high in CBD or is really good Med out

637
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,519
it's medicine share well cuts are one

638
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,399
thing seeds are another yeah yeah seeds

639
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,119
are available like I think seeds should

640
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,519
be getting get given out uh that's part

641
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,759
of why you guys are frustrated with me

642
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,319
there's not a lot of stuff at Natures

643
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,158
green remedies.com it's because all my

644
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,720
locals are getting it um there is

645
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,640
obviously a markup when you go through a

646
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,079
dealer a distributor and I'm skipping

647
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,799
that markup and getting the seeds to my

648
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,798
locals at wholesale prices cuz it feels

649

people that you surround yourself with

744
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,079
the most on purpose are who you become

745
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,200
and there are five people sitting around

746
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,918

752
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,360
completely agree with that same

753
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,519
statement I've never really thought

754
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,079
about it like that before so that's why

755
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,720
I was staring at you I was like hm I'm

years yeah uh and of course Angela would

761
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,080
be if there was another person to be

762
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,200
here that would contribute to who I have

763
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,759
have been lately Angela would be uh if

764
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,200
you two count if MD and Spence were a

765
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,919
person as we put that couple just Garden

766
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,679
of Weeden yeah if they were Garden of

767
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,320

mention it now because I I had no idea I

875
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,599
if you knew what my guess was it was

876
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,640
nothing close that that was awesome I

877
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,599
thought maybe like

878
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,440
1,500 that's what I was thinking but I

879
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,959
did I mean I don't think about the fact

880
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,679
that it's the it's the web anybody can

881
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,000
listen to it anybody anywhere I sent

882
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,679
print ads to Nature's green remedies and

883
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,519

884
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,840
3 months got my ad in the mail with

885
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,120

887
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,918

888
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,080
on printing up a new logo and bombing

889
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,720
the world with new newsletter ads and

890
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,319
stuff nice will drop them every I wonder

891
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,000
what our what our craziest location uh

892
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,798
listener is I can probably tell you by

893
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
looking at the uh the logistics on my

894
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:41,679
website it tells me where yeah I could

895
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,759
see where everybody's IP address is but

896
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,759
the problem is if people cheat on their

897
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,038
IP addresses CU they can't be looking at

898
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,359
certain [ __ ] where they're from so they

899
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,599
got to go in somewhere else and then

900
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,879

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,599
to be a rule just not applicable to you

1192
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,920
know at this moment but yeah once it's

1193
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,160
on social media it's they're definitely

1194

uh if they want to know all the rules

1195

1207
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,599
the episode it shows me how far you drop

1208

accident it was it was clearly an

1292
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,318
accident and it was clearly the straw

1293
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,240
that that broke

1438
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,318
of the people that were talking [ __ ]

1441
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,359
kidding probably the one of the least

1442
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,759
violent people I

1443
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,000

1444
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,280
minutes we should put about another 10

1445
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,358
minutes into this show anybody got

1446

1448
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,280
moments we've had on this podcast so far

1449
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:03,558
I know remember that night we s here we

1450
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,798
talked about it earlier we sat here you

1451
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:06,960
sat across the table from me and we

1452
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:08,679
tried to do a show for like three hours

1453
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,559
and I don't know if it was the dabs or

1454
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:14,719
if it was just the the

1455
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:17,119
unfocused of the group but yeah there

1456
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,000
was no podcast to that night you know

1457
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,760
like in the middle of the podcast he

1458
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,400
just walks up in the room starts yelling

1459
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,480
and screaming and it was D it was weird

1460
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,440
so there's it didn't really happen but

1461
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,240
it kind of really did happen happen you

1462
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,000
know but that was that was definitely a

1463
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:32,719
funny moment that was funny we I had a

1464
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,079
recording error to where I didn't delete

1465
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,358
one of the pre-recorded tracks from

1466
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,680
another recording session and when it

1467
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,400
came around to that that recording

1468
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:39,919
dropped into while we were talking and

1469
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,200
it was perfect it was perfect it was

1470
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,119
like cuz the guy goes hey it's me man

1471
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,399
what's going on it just starts

1472
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
talking and we like but you're not even

1473
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,798
in the room how the hell did you just do

1474
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,440
that I thought Jeff was a vental acquist

1475
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:54,079

a moment that I really really remember

1480
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,798
is when I ate the 350 migr edible on the

1481

whole hour show but I kind of remember

1483
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,838
doing it I sat here holding on to my

1484
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,440
chair just tapping my feet as hard as I

1485

1497
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:46,880
Marine Dow 70 of them I don't remember

1498
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:49,480
yeah like it's read the [ __ ]

1499
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,599
label like that's what that was the big

1500
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,159
lesson of 2014 is what happens if you

1501
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,960
legalize wheed oh is it turns out people

1502
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,118
don't read labels for [ __ ] anything

1503
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,240
ever we just assume people that don't

1504
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:01,240
even take pot like they don't even well

1505
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,639
if you think about it do you all

1506
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:04,078
remember the chips that gave you anal

1507
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,519
leakage like they were looking for fat

1508
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,640
free and it made your [ __ ] drip that

1509
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:10,639
had to be on the front of the bag and

1510
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,318
they still sold everywhere and it's

1511
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:15,358
because people don't read labels and

1512
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:17,719
with Edibles that leaves you to hugging

1513
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,960
a pair of weird jeans in a hotel room

1514
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:21,000
and then writing about it for the New

1515
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,039
York Times Orie may try not to [ __ ]

1516
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
himself on

1517
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:25,440
stage you know the meme with the little

1518
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,280
black kid that always says you mean to

1519
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,119
tell me that blah blah blah and blah

1520
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,880
blah blah but you mean to tell me there

1521
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,280
was some [ __ ] chips that caused anal

1522
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,318
leakage and people were still buying it

1523
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,319
I forgot that y'all were probably on T

1524
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:40,358
fish tour when this hit the shelves cuz

1525
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:42,119
it's the those timelines line up butra I

1526
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:44,000
think was the special oil they found a

1527
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:46,798
special oil and you could eat chips that

1528
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,199
you didn't get any calories from the

1529
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:50,880
side effect was your butt was leaking

1530
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,480
yeah all that fat your body didn't

1531
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,960
absorb was dripping out your ass so no

1532
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,480
I'll pass I will pass America was about

1533
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,920
it I don't need a snack I have to eat on

1534
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,039
the toilet see Jesse's a fellow eat

1535
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,400
anything at the gas station kid you know

1536
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,480
what the [ __ ] up no I remember making

1537
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,440
fun of my cousin for eating those yeah

1538
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,480
remember reading the package I'm like

1539
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,000
it's right on the front of the bag May C

1540
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,960
anal said anal on the front of a bag of

1541
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,599
chips and they still sold all over the

1542
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,440
country this is definitely a record time

1543
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,359
for the word anal being so so when it

1544
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,599
says 350 mli they're in a jar

1545
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,078
for people just don't even see it they

1546
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,640

01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:39,000
three bucks that came from nowhere and

1906
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,119
then I learned about something else that

1907
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,599
I may try to do in the future um it's

1908
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,358
called a money bomb is what this guy

1909
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,680
called it uh if you listen to a lot of

1910
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:47,199
podcasts you may already know about it I

1911
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,759
don't want to tell you too much about I

1912
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,919
haven't uh paid too much attention to

1913
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,359
how to do it but it sounds like a great

1914
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,159
idea to where it will give me money to

1915
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:55,920
give away to my listeners and also help

1916
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,159
fund the podcast a little and like

1917
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
Maddie said I do put some time into this

1918
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,480
uh they everybody here spent about an

1919
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,559
hour with me before we even recorded

1920
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,079
putting this show together uh I was

1921
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:07,519
thinking while you were talking what it

1922
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:09,599
would cost to get all of us in a room

1923
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,278
uhhuh uh sa for like a two-hour

1924
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,920
consultation with the

1925
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:16,199
business and it's in the thousands oh

1926
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,159
yeah I'm expensive for that kind of

1927
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:20,000
thing if you get all this at the table

1928
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:21,199
being up is upfront and honest as we are

1929
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,599
at the podcast and I'm sitting there

1930
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:26,519
thinking about the content over the last

1931
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:29,680
50 episodes and if you go back and

1932
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:32,239
cherry pick say like the outdoor grow

1933
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,239
lesson episodes or and the growing and

1934
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,838
curing and harvesting

1935
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,399
episodes

1936
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:41,000
that's like job training if you pay

1937
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,160
attention to take notes no you could

1938
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,239
fully have a career based on that

1939
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:47,078
information if you put a couple of years

1940
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:48,838
of practice into it and do your own

1941
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,760
independent research that's the found

1942
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,278
that's like a bachelor's degree in

1943
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,839
weed like not even [ __ ] around a

1944
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:59,318
little that's legit and Jesse's outdoor

1945
01:05:56,838 --> 01:06:01,358
lessons this year basically walked me

1946
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:03,400
through my outdoor this year you know

1947
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,400
like there was there was Cure episode

1948
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,720
got your weed dried and cured absolutely

1949
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,318
and then sea came and talked to you

1950
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,318
about Organics and taught you how to not

1951
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,480
go buy bottled nutrients anymore and I

1952
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,880
mean just yesterday I mixed up grok

1953
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,639
Kashi you know what I'm saying like H

1954
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,440
look out so here for a year mixing grok

1955
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:20,759
Kashi right I want to get an extract

1956
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,278
artist on here that will teach us how to

1957
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,319
make hash but at the same time that's

1958
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:26,159
risky because uh we can't teach you how

1959
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,798
to open blast cuz that's not legit and

1960
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,679
then uh nobody wants to give away their

1961
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:32,000
clothes sit around and tell you how a

1962
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:33,318
whole bunch maybe we'll get someone to

1963
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,960
come teach us how to make water hash

1964
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:36,239

01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,920
come teach you how to make water hatch

1966
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,239
