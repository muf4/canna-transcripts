to apologize that my website looks like

83
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,060
[ __ ] at the end of every episode or

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,259
actually when I tweet the episodes out

85
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,670
and a new episode comes out I like to

86

I went to I read genetics Colorado calm

92
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,598
the other day and I realized it looks

93
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,128
like a piece of [ __ ] website they need

94
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,289
some love and need some updating I

95
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,628
apologize my web guy has been distracted

96
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:21,179
I don't really put much effort or energy

97
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:22,828
into that website so it's there it's

98
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,150
gonna get fixed eventually but it does

99
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,769
look like [ __ ] and it's embarrassing I'm

100
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,000
acknowledging that it needs love and I'm

101
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,709
also admitting that it looks like [ __ ]

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,289
and I know it I'm not proud of it so

103
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,370
please don't judge me on that now you

104
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,900
guys are gonna go there and [ __ ] look

105
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,900
at it but you're right it does look like

106

114
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,840

see Jerry play on a stage Bob where spit

165
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,530
on me during throwing stones at a show

166
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,000
at the Paramount Theatre one year the

167
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,119
day before Halloween I forget what year

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,730
it was like maybe six maybe ish maybe 97

169
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,949
it was a long freaking time ago rat dog

170
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,660
did a couple nights at the Paramount

171
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,490
Theatre in Denver they did a Halloween

172
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,800
and I went to the night before Halloween

173
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,300
that was the night that the spit landed

174
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,420
on my face hose front rows [ __ ]

175
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,310
awesome but never saw Jerry you're

176
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,199
coming to see Panik this summer I don't

177
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,030
know that I'll go see Panik I'm not huge

178
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,829
into panic like I used to be at all

179
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,739
without my key and with all the changes

180
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:24,659
I lost interest in panic I saw panic ah

181
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,519
that that's one thing I can't say I saw

182
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,420
widespread panic when Michael Houser was

183
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,459
still in the band

184
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,530
I shook Michael Hauser's hand I was on

185
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,269
panic tour I was on the tour when

186
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,069
Michael quit actually when he resigned

187
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,079
and stepped down and let George

188
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,668
McConnell take over for him I was on

189
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,168
tour with panic at that time so I could

190
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,930
see a lot of panic shows I saw Mikey's

191
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,519
last show

192
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,769
I got to go to the Red Rock Shows right

193
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,209
after Michael Hauser passed away so I

194
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,789
was a huge panic fan I just kind of lost

195
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,199
interest mo is [ __ ] awesome mo is

196

198
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,560

204
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,569
car tires maybe even older stuff than

205
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,970
that but I've seen a lot of mo shows I

206

221
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,159
started talking about music music so my

222
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,719
favorite things listening to the

223
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,370
Grateful Dead is sort of a daily ritual

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,680
for myself as well I listen to a lot of

225
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,030
Grateful Dead I've got the Sirius XM in

226
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,009
the car so got the Grateful Dead radio

227
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,929
as soon as I turn on the car Jerry comes

228
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,509
on and starts singing can't get much

229
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,400
better than that used to let's do a lot

230
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,409
of Metallica Iron Maiden and rush I

231
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,310
listen to a lot I don't listen I

232
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,960
listened to a lot of Metallica Lars is

233
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,560
who I'm a drummer I've played the drum

234
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,389
since I was 14 years old I played the

235
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,889
desk at school I played the buckets

236
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,329
wherever I was I played the [ __ ]

237
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,550
walls I played the tables I played

238
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,899
whatever made noise fraught probably

239
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,970
from when I was like 7 years old and

240
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,829
tell him now but I've been a drummer I

241
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,510
was born to be a drummer and Lars is

242
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,459
kind of what triggered that now I know

243
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,800
Lars is kind of a shitty drummer I know

244
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,789
that but he's still that's what started

245
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,139
it all I didn't know that he was

246
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,160
terrible when I was 12 years old and

247
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,259
thinking that he was the coolest [ __ ] in

248
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,820
the world here's a cool weed related

249
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,468
story missile this is a good segue to

250
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,809
make this weed related part of how I

251
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,640
became a drummer I have two uncles who

252
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,989
are really cool guys shout out Ron and

253
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,519
Eric I have another uncle also but he

254
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,870
wasn't in the story Troy love you two

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,029
men love all three my uncles cool

256
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,589
[ __ ] dudes they are part of why I am

257
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,289
Who I am I've got traits of all of them

258
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,490
in me they kind of helped raise me so

259
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,458
shot at all my uncle's [ __ ] love you

260
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,740
guys but anyway Ron and Eric took me to

261
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,699
my first real concert when I was young I

262
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,649
was probably four

263
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,970
ten years old I'm gonna guess and then

264
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,709
you know what as in California and I'm

265
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,110
left California when I was 14 so I had

266
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,400
to be 13 or 14 years old not much I

267
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,820
couldn't be any older than that so

268
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,189
they'd take me to a concert the bands

269
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,080
were Jackyl and the Damn Yankees I know

270
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,120
not the best bands ever but Jackyl was

271
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,500
[ __ ] cool and the Damn Yankees they

272
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,909
could play music whatever back in the

273
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,990
day I was going to a concert I didn't

274
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,159
care who's gonna go have some fun and

275
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,620
see some boobs and hear some loud music

276
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,719
it was [ __ ] epic it was at the Long

277
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,419
Beach arena I think or the LA sport's

278
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,029
arena somewhere in LA or Long Beach in

279
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:29,649
California a small a kind of a large

280
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,970
place but they divided it in half by

281
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,980
putting up a giant curtain so it could

282
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,440
be a smaller venue for these not a level

283
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,629
bands to play but on the way there my

284
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,130
uncle had a Chevy El Camino so it's got

285
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:40,360
seats up front but then in the back it's

286
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,919
kind of like a truck bed but he had a

287
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,800
camper shell on it it was all carpeted

288
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,419
and he had some speakers back there and

289
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,159
the black album from Metallica had just

290
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,649
come out so whatever year that was

291
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,259
that's when this happened and he played

292
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:55,480
the Black Album from Metallica all the

293
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,370
way to the concert and my two uncles in

294
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,009
the front of the car smoked a fat joint

295
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,950
during the drive and I'm pretty sure I

296
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:04,269
got pretty stoned I had smoked I don't

297
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,710
know that I'd smoked yeah I had smoked a

298
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,269
couple times with my buddy Chris and

299
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,850
stuff by then but I wasn't really

300
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:11,620
smoking a lot so I got a nice contact

301
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,600
high from there their joint in the front

302
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,090
of the car we got nice and stoned and

303
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,649
went saw Metallica so yeah that's that's

304
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,870
a good weed related but that's part of

305
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,909
what that trip in the car me in the back

306
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,519
of that Chevy El Camino getting stoned

307
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:26,259
off my uncle's weed listening to sad but

308
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,689
true is where something inside of me

309
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,279
said I'm a [ __ ] drummer I am going to

310
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,660
play the drums and from then on all I

311
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,949
did was walk around an aerodrome on

312
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,110
everything and look like I was having a

313
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,030
problem just air drumming everywhere

314
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,830
doing big drum fills in the air all the

315
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,379
time play the steering wheel play the

316
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,000
car seat play it all man but anyway

317
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,500
that's part of how I got addicted to the

318
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,779
drums and it's cannabis-related

319
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,370
I was never really into Iron Maiden

320
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,669
doesn't really do it much for me not my

321
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,019
thing

322
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:51,610
but all the other stuff you listen to

323
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,679

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,590
drive around and listen to Kendrick

358
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,540
Lamar this weekend with my daughter she

359
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,720
got the new Kendrick of Kendrick Lamar

360
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,519
on her phone that was interesting that

361
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,509
is not my favorite kind of music but

362
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,500
when your kids in the car you just let

363
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,090
her listen to whatever she wants to

364
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,620
because she's [ __ ] cooler than you

365
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,970
guys and she wins anyway all right I am

366
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,100
super rambling today you guys if you

367
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,450
can't tell I've got this little head

368
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
cold thing and I took a bunch of dads

369
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,460
and it just made my brain fly out of my

370
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,769
head

371
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,269
so I'm not all focused but the [ __ ]

372
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,710
needs to be focused for a podcast all

373
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,769
right this is a cannabis podcast we can

374
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,879
be a little bit off the rails today see

375
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,230
something happening in the recording

376
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,679
software that I need to make a note of

377
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,820
around 12 minutes and 20 seconds she's

378
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,169
gonna have to fix something it's cool

379
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,940
you guys won't never notice cuz I will

380
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:32,620
have fixed it by the time this goes out

381
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,480
I think this is gonna be straight what

382
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,519
we call live to drive in the recording

383
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,170
industry I'm just gonna record it put it

384
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,850
out probably won't even edit this it's

385
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,870
gonna be a great show you guys get to

386
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,360
feel the vibe feel like you're hanging

387
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,580
out with me makes it easier alright what

388
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,500
I want to do now I've talked about I

389
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,990
apologize for my website sucking I

390
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,639
corrected three years I told you I got a

391
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,889
little bit of cold told you what my

392
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,360
friends are listening to now I think we

393
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,769
should read some iTunes comments I try

394
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,210
to read the iTunes comments about once a

395
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:59,350
month

396
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,180
people have been pouring in more iTunes

397
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,710
comments this feels like the more I read

398
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:05,349
them the more people send them so that's

399
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,730
awesome so let's start just reading them

400
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,800

called me the Joe Rogan experience of

522
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,720
marijuana I'm [ __ ] honored Joe Rogan

523
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,308
is my favorite podcaster Joe Rogan is

524
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,558
one of my favorite comedians the Joe

525
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,838
Rogan experience podcast is my most

526
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:19,519
listened to podcast probably because he

527
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,778
puts out nine to twelve hours of content

528
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,869
every [ __ ] week and you can't stop

529
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:25,730
listening but to be compared to my

530
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:27,739
podcast hero to one of my favorite

531
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,019
podcasts to probably the number one most

532
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,638
popular podcast on the planet to be

533
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:33,859
compared to Joe Rogan that's a true

534
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:35,898
honor so thank you that I could just

535
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:37,129
turn off the mic right now mic drop film

536
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:40,009
I could go home and be a satisfied

537
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,159
podcaster I won't do that to you but I

538
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,658
could so thanks this podcast is it's not

539
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,950
a lot of work but it's work you know

540
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:47,778
what I mean I got to sit here for the

541
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,759
duration of the podcast and run my face

542
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:51,289
and then there's a lot of preparation

543
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,390
I've got editing to do I've got to post

544
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,609
the show I've got a website to try and

545
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,009
[ __ ] maintain apparently there's some

546
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:00,529
work that goes into it so to hear people

547
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:02,509
say ah but I'm the Joe Rogan of

548
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,250
marijuana and for all the people at the

549
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,410
dude grows cup that told me how much I

550
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,029
helped there grows and help them succeed

551
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,220
and how much I've improved their Gardens

552
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:12,230
all of that [ __ ] makes it worth it the

553
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,970
patreon contributions those are [ __ ]

554
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,099
awesome I really appreciate those but

555
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,750
when people just say hey your words and

556
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,399
your wisdom made my garden better and

557
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,930
hey you're the Joe Rogan of cannabis

558
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,940
that's [ __ ] huge for me

559
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,130
that puts some pride inside of my soul

560
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,330
but but you guys on patreon I still love

561
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,830

562
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:29,389
don't love you that's awesome but but

563
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:31,339
giving being given praise like that

564
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,200
means a lot to me all right I've got one

565
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:35,539

00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,538
indicating that it needs a liquid so I'm

620
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,860

629

00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,740
about the Grateful dog that doesn't

640
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,148
correlate at all but speaking of

641
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,609
grateful dog somebody was asking me

642
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:03,528
about selecting male plants and I've

643
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:06,069

644
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,940

645
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:09,710

646
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,509
something that I thought was a trick up

647
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,490
my own sleeve something I didn't know

648
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,720
was so well known but I've seen it on

649
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,159
Facebook a lot of people were talking

650
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,048
about it so now I feel more comfortable

651
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,809
sharing my knowledge there are some

652
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:22,548
things I do like to keep to myself but

653
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:26,359
it is time to share this little secret

654
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:29,388
if you are looking to choose a male for

655
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,548
breeding first of all I'm not gonna go

656
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,959
over the whole criteria on how to select

657
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:37,278
a male there are a lot of things to look

658
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,159
for mainly shape structure aroma does it

659
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,499
produce trichomes rub the stem smell

660
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,090
your fingers see what it smells like

661
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:47,538
also how long does it take to draw

662
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:50,058
pollen how long will it drop pollen how

663
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,829
long from the time it starts dropping

664
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,878
pollen how long will it keep dropping

665
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:55,038
palm there are a lot of things I like to

666
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:57,498
pay attention to I could go on and on

667
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,509
about male selection there's another

668
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:03,440
trick that you can use for selecting a

669
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:05,028
male plant you can so let's say you grow

670
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,038
out of 10 pack of seeds and there are

671
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:08,329
there's gonna be five males in there

672
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,980
there's a good chance you'll get five

673
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:11,449
males I usually throw away the first one

674
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,190
the first plant to show male I don't

675
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,899
want it it's going to be two male it's

676
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,759
going to pass on too much of its genes

677
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:17,329
to the progeny and you're just gonna

678
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,240
make a cop

679
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:21,649
that male so toss that if the second and

680
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,839
third or fourth and fifth one look like

681
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,360
look like candidates what I will do is I

682
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,669
will reverse those males and turn them

683
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,059
into females and flower them and see

684
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,170
what they do as a female I'm gonna say

685
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,460
that again because I know a lot of

686
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,720
people just scratch their heads and said

687
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,360
what the [ __ ] yes

688
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,360
I will take a male plant and I will

689
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,219
treat it with silver thiosulfate and I

690
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,559
will continue to flower that plant until

691
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,710
it turns into a female that male plant

692
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,869
will turn into a female plant that will

693
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,470
happen if you treat it with silver

694
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:57,049
thiosulfate appropriately and properly

695
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,779
now I continue to flower it those male

696
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,879
flower clusters will turn in to female

697
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:05,680
flowers they will be calyxes and they

698
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,570
will form buds it will be 90 percent

699
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,340
close to what that plan is going to look

700
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:11,450
like if it were actually the female it's

701
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,889
gonna be a little funky because you just

702
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,740
[ __ ] it up but it's gonna give you a

703
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,520
very good 90 to 99 percent I don't wanna

704
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,799
tell you it's gonna be a hundred percent

705
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,779
exact it's gonna be super close to what

706
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,819
that plant would be like if it were a

707
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,680
Fiat rue female and it will show you the

708
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,409
traits now you can see does it produce

709
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,480
resin does it smell does it make big

710
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,910
chunky heavy buds does it make pretty

711
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,259
colors is it something desirable to use

712
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,050
in breeding does that have traits that I

713
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:38,869
want to pass on to make another creation

714
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,089
so yes you can reverse a male cannabis

715
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:43,129
plant using silver thiosulfate to turn

716
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:44,689
it into a female and see what type of

717
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,670
traits you are passing on to your

718
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:51,049
breeding stock I know I was quiet for a

719
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,250
long time there I know a lot of people

720
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,960
are gonna be blown the [ __ ] away by this

721
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,220
because when I started talking about it

722
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,569
on Facebook and when I saw it on

723
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,180
Facebook a lot of people had a lot of

724
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:01,429
questions now people are gonna say how

725
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,740
do you reverse a male plant or a female

726
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,870
plant a lot of people have used the

727
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,819
colloidal silver method I do not use

728
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,769
that I find that to be unreliable and

729
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,269
not effective and that's that's

730
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:13,160
redundant right unreliable and not

731
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,019
effective whatever it doesn't work well

732
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,750
enough you need to spray it too many

733
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:20,299
times I like to use silver thiosulfate I

734
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,039
order powdered silver and I think it's

735
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,329
powdered sodium thiosulfate

736
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,379
I haven't ordered it in a long time so I

737
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,579
haven't read it and it makes me feel

738
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,890
dumb that I don't know what it is right

739
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,519
away but I know what the [ __ ] is I've

740
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,680
got them

741
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,160
I ordered the two powdered containers I

742
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,400
make

743
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,290
them into jars of distilled water you

744
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,820
put so much of powder a into a jar so

745
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,680
much a powder B into a jar you shake it

746
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:41,299
with the distilled water so that it

747
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,509
really dissolves in there real well and

748
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,819
then you put 50% of Part A and 50% of

749
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,710
Part B into more water you mix them into

750
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,960
more water to make the dilution that you

751
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,730
need and each plant is going to need a

752
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,289
different concentration I have hit

753
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,210
plants with straight-up undiluted the

754
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:58,369
undiluted mix before they get real burnt

755
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,610
up but they will reverse very quickly

756
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:04,129
some plants prefer one heavy dose some

757
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,869
plants prefer a few light doses some

758
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,760
plants it's better to start hitting them

759
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,399
with the silver thiosulfate before you

760
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,730
even flour them this is going to take

761
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,840
some experimentation on your part so if

762
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,670
you want to do this if you want to

763
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,789
reverse a male or a female you need to

764
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,870
get the silver thiosulfate solutions

765
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,069
I've talked about this before and I'm

766
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,319
gonna say it again when you are playing

767
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:27,649
with these chemicals they are chemicals

768
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,240
please wear proper gloves not just

769
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,070
little latex gloves you need thicker

770
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,329
gloves you need the proper safety

771
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:34,849
equipment so that you don't hurt

772
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:36,470
yourself also you need eyewear anytime

773
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:38,599
you're playing with any chemicals any

774
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,700
pesticides anything liquid anything that

775
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,319
can just end up in your eye by [ __ ]

776
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,640
sneezing or bumping something wrong

777
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,919

protect your eyes they're the most

782
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,170
sensitive organs exposed to the elements

783
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,580
and you only got two of them and you

784
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,630
need them both you don't want to walk

785
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,669
around like a pirate for the rest of

786
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,020
your life because you made a mistake

787
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,950
please protect your eyes so get the

788
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:07,220
silver thiosulfate get it into the water

789
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,420
at the delusions I can post it on I can

790
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,559
post it on it'll be in the show notes

791
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,759
I'm gonna write it down there we go I

792
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,200
wrote it down put the delusions in the

793
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,650
show notes so you'll have to pull it

794
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
silver

795
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,400
thiosulfate powders into the liquids

796
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,139
then you mix those together into one

797
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,150
container and then you put that in a

798
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,560
spray bottle and spray your mail plant

799
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,180
or your female plant whichever point

800
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,159
you're trying to reverse spray the [ __ ]

801
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,320
out of it I soaked it make sure to get

802
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,150
this stalks not just the leaves get the

803
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,279
stems you want to get the stalks of that

804
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,730
plant also you want to soak the plant

805
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,649
with the silver thiosulfate I would

806
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,630
recommend doing it seven to ten days

807
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:44,540
before you put it into flower hit it and

808
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,440
then this is where

809
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,909
have to decide if you want to hit it

810
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,500
with undiluted silver thiosulfate

811
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,940
solution or if you want to kind of

812
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,339
dilute it a little bit some plants like

813
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,529
a 10% dilution so I'm like 50 so I'm

814
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:56,209
need a 90 if you hit it with the

815
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,009
undiluted the plants are going to

816
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,600
crinkle up and look like you kicked the

817
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,700
[ __ ] out of that you will however

818
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,139
reverse the plant you'll get the effect

819
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,730
if you're going for pollen they will

820
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,170
make pollen if you're trying to turn it

821
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,759
into a female it will turn it into a

822
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,920
female but it's gonna look like [ __ ] if

823
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,660
you want to be more gentle use a lighter

824
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,400
dilution and spray more frequently and

825
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,290
start earlier I don't know how else to

826
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,370
explain that you can go hard a few times

827
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,809
you're gonna [ __ ] up the plant and it

828
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,399
will work or you can go light more

829
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:22,879
frequently and he won't see as much

830
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:26,000
damage but it will take more more sprays

831
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,740
and more time to make it work you're

832
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,279
gonna have to experiment with golden

833
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,200
goat

834
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,299
I had to spray that [ __ ] every single

835
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,330
day to get her to reverse I was using

836
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:38,629
silver thiosulfate wait about a 30%

837
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:39,919
dilution so I would mix the two into the

838
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,240
containers of water and I was calling

839
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,250
that a hundred percent when I mixed them

840
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,460
that was 100 percent of the solution

841
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,599
then I would add water to it and dilute

842
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,430
it and that's what I was calling my

843
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,929
dilution rates my 50 to 30 percent

844
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,220
however much water I added to it that's

845
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,620
what I was calling the dilution so if I

846
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,110
had half water half my solution that was

847
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,269
a 50/50 the golden goat really needed to

848
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,039
be blasted a lot I learned that if I

849
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:03,079
started blasting the golden goat early

850
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,149
before I put her into flour like ten

851
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,189
days before I put it into flour spray it

852
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,200
every single day until I started seeing

853
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,820
male plants then it would really reverse

854
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,430
if I wasn't aggressive with it the

855
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:16,849
golden goat would not reverse what else

856
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:19,279
did I try to try to reverse the the pea

857
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:21,529
Rafi the [ __ ] reversed with like just

858
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,119
one strong spray I just hit it right at

859
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,250
the start of flower and the leaves

860
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,869
curled up all weird and then like day 14

861
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,819
of flower you could see those male male

862
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,409
plant are the male balls just building

863
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:32,240
up so it didn't take much at all for the

864
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,870
for the P Rafi now and just reversed

865
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,220
right away

866
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,779
you guys don't hear a lot about the pure

867
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,339
Fe cuz it sucked it wasn't fun to work

868
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,259
with I didn't like the progeny so it

869
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,480
disappeared sometimes you got to throw

870
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,930
[ __ ] away just how stuff works all right

871
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,240
