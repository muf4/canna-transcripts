00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,750
month of February this podcast received

over 100,000 downloads in the month of

69
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,919
February February is the shortest month

70
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,959
of the year and I broke a record in the

71
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,280
month of February thank you all so

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,469
thanks to everybody that listens on

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,640
every other service unfortunately iTunes

74
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,609
and all the other services do not

75
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,348
provide very good statistics or

76
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,879
information or data to me iTunes just

77
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,259
kind of opened up some data but it's not

78
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,289
very thorough yet it's their beta

79
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,699
stitcher gives me a lot of info so

80
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:57,378
stitcher showed me that I had a hundred

81
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,079
thousand downloads in the month of

82
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,519
February and that blows my mind so thank

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,719

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,939

about let me tell you guys about patreon

97
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,389
really quickly I'm sure you've already

98
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,730
heard about it patreon is a website

99
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,949
patreon is a service that allows you as

100
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,679
a listener to financially contribute to

101
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,719
podcasts and other content creators go

102
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,189
to patreon in maybe your favorite

103
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,689
content creator maybe there's an artist

104
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,039
on there maybe there's a musician on

105
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,469
there that you want to support but I

106
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,509
have got a patreon creator page where

107
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,669
you can financially contribute to my

108
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,679
efforts and what will happen is you'll

109
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,238
go to patreon.com/scishow from your

110
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,010
heart you read all the information about

111
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,840
the podcast you'll read my promises to

112
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,518
you you'll read my goals if you feel

113
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,439
like contributing you type in a dollar

114
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,150
amount and you can contribute to my show

115
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,280
what I will do with those funds I'm

116
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,219
going to use them to buy a new MacBook

117
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,318
Pro my computer is going slow enough to

118
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,299
have me a little bit worried I I don't

119
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,858
use it excessively anymore I don't use

120
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,290
it for things that it's not necessary

121
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,509
I've been trying just use the computer

122
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,098
just for recording purposes so it lasts

123
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:21,108
as long as possible but that is my new

124
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:23,209
goal I'm going to replace the MacBook

125
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,189
with the patreon contributions that may

126
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,199
take quite a while but I'm going to do

127
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:28,939
the best I can I will also throw in my

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,879
own funding but I'm trying to do it the

129
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:33,620
most I can from patreon it just really

130
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,569
helps me it makes my life easier

131
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,680
a new MacBook is quite pricey but that's

132
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,689
what's gonna happen with the patreon

133
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,129
contributions so anyone that contributes

134
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:42,319
to patreon thank you for the help you

135
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,149

136
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,769

137
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,388

139
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,228
now speaking of patreon one of my

140
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,509
promises on patreon is that if you

141
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:56,269

read your email on a future episode now

143
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,769
I didn't have any sort of notification

144
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,629
set up on my patreon so a few people

145
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,459
contributed and I never read their

146
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,189
emails and I realized it and I got to

147
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,629
their emails as soon as I could I

148
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,848
apologize for that if you feel like you

149
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,769
contributed to patreon and I did not

150
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:14,779
read your email that you expected read

151
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:16,759

160
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,110
to know that people were contributing

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,879
and expecting that level

162
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,889
I just wasn't I didn't have patreon set

163
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,449
up correctly to notify me so I missed a

164
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,129
couple and I'm trying to be accountable

165
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,870
and catch up and read those for you

166
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:42,730
so here is one of those that I did miss

167
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,100
and this person was polite enough to

168
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,540
reach out and say hey bro I contributed

169
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,560
and you never read it so here's a repost

170
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,930
of my email and it goes like this Wow

171
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,850
gwaan rusted Jeff what's kickin man this

172
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,800
email is a bit overdue I'm a patreon

173
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,460
supporter and a longtime listener of

174
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,470
your show

175
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,389
big up all you do for the community man

176
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,070
Babylon is plagued by ignorance and

177
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,139
oppression the wisdom and knowledge you

178
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,699
spread is our best tool to fight and

179
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,889
rise above the injustice and oppression

180
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,050
surrounding this sacred herb keep

181
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,110
educating people give thanks man that's

182
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,550
a great intro to an email thank you I

183
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,020
think it's great that you say Babylon is

184
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,120
plagued by ignorance and oppression and

185
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,039
the wisdom and knowledge I spread is our

186
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,340
best tool because a lot of what inspired

187
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,780
me to do a podcast was reading forums

188
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,149
and reading things on the internet that

189
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,739
were absolutely incorrect things that

190
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,179
were going to cause more problems for

191
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,069
people's gardens and that made me say

192
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,720
[ __ ] I need to step up and do something

193
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,610
and that I thought the best thing I

194
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,410
could do would be write a book but then

195
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,480
I realized that a book would be

196
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,100
ever-changing because the episode I

197
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,900
wrote about drying and curing two years

198
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,669
ago I've learned so much since then that

199
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,889
it would be a new book now and the old

200
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:50,229
book would be obsolete and so I think

201
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,849
podcasting is ever-evolving and I can

202
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,710
put out new content as soon as I learn

203
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,220
it so that's why I ended up podcasting

204
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:59,439
so thank you that ignorance and plague

205
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,550
of Babylon and that oppression as part

206
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,879
of what inspired this

207
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,040
I try to keep my rastafari ideas and my

208
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,629
Rasta talk and thoughts to myself

209
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,390
because I don't think that's what people

210
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:13,550
are listening to the podcast for but

211
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,560
when you say the wisdom and knowledge I

212
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,030
spread is our best tool to fight and

213
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,959
rise above the injustice and oppression

214
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:22,909
surrounding this sacred herb that really

215
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,709
speaks to me as a Rasta man and that

216
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,450
lets me know that I'm doing exactly what

217
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,189
I need to be doing and that I am right

218
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,779
where I need to be helping the people I

219
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:31,730
need to be helping the way I need to be

220
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,559
helping them so thank you it's a huge

221
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,090
compliment and it meant more than you

222
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,009
thought it would so I appreciate that

223
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,159
ah then he says keep educating people

224
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,289
give thanks yes I I love to educate and

225
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,880
I will keep it up as long as I can you

226
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,890
guys I keep promising more episodes I'm

227
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,719
almost a 300 and I see no end in sight

228
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,250
there's no reason to stop doing this as

229
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,900
long as this microphone that computer

230
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,839
and this throat work I will keep putting

231
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,209
out podcasts mm-hmm all right the email

232
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,679
keeps going you guys it goes like this

233
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:00,019
up until recently I was a grower at a

234
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,209
large state licensed medical production

235
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:03,859
facility here on the East Coast as you

236
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,419
know there's nothing like a good podcast

237
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,250
to keep you flowing and vibing through a

238
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,100
long day in the garden I would look

239
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,480
forward to your podcast each Monday

240
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,160
unfortunately the folks I worked for

241
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,740
didn't exactly believe in growing from

242
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,450
the heart and I chose to move on to find

243
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,790
an operation with more like-minded

244
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,370
values and put the patients and plants

245
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,410
above profit haiya much respect for

246
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,959
doing that and that's a challenging

247
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,020
thing to do in this industry finding

248
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,699
owners and managers and investors that

249
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,220
have the heart that the growers have is

250
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,939
one of the largest challenges I've faced

251
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,259
in this industry

252
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,120
we'll keep going at the email it goes

253
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,069
like this your podcast inspired me and

254
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,810
helped me and helped give me the

255
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,870
strength and confidence to move on and

256
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,339
follow my heart I can't thank you enough

257
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,419
and your email is huge thing so you're

258
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,280
working at it thank you

259
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:53,019
I now I work at a boutique veganic

260
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,139
caregiving operation that puts out

261
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:57,519
quality medicine above all else see it

262
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,710
looks like you worked hard II found your

263
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,799
way in you realized it wasn't what you

264
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,660
wanted you got a good background and now

265
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,269
you're where you want to be that's that

266
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:09,699
deserves props right there so good start

267
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,659
man good start it's hard to leave

268
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,270
somewhere when you've already got

269
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,699
employment like it's harder to go look

270
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,470
for employment it's easier to go to a

271
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,759
job that sucks than it is to go look for

272
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,800
a new job is what I think I'm trying to

273
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,850
say so man that took some balls to get

274
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,889
out of there and I'm doing I'm glad

275
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,330
you're at a veganic caregiving operation

276
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,929
that puts out quality medicine that's

277
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,970
what matters

278
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,649
I bet the patients there love your

279
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,810
product and I bet you love the patients

280
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,009
and now you like your job better and so

281
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,259
you're gonna put out a better product

282
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,210
and turn alright the email keeps going

283
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:39,069
it says I apologize for the long email

284
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,300
but I figured I should sneak in a Gro

285
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,760
question while I'm at it

286
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,979
hey dude no need to apologize for a long

287
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,289
email I get quite long-winded I guess

288
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,210
it's okay that you do also the email

289
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,860
continues it goes like this I really

290
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,200
enjoyed your recent episode on fire

291
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,269
safety and you guys this email was kind

292
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,460
of a long way back I just didn't find it

293
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:58,929
and so there was an email or an episode

294
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,009
about fire safety that did happen you

295
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,870
may have to go search through the feed

296
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,279
but it's there he says it got me

297
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,860
thinking about something else pertaining

298
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,809
to safety that's often overlooked would

299
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,789
you mind sharing any knowledge you have

300
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,649
in regards to eye protection in the grow

301
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:13,809
room when I worked for the dispensary

302
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,519
they provided special HPS safety glasses

303
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,039
made by Phillips like the bulb company

304
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,960
and my new garden I was surprised to see

305
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,209
everyone just rocked standard polarized

306
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,769
sunglasses I'm sensitive to bright light

307
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,780
and prefer not to [ __ ] around with my

308
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,090
eyes so I drop some dough on a pair of

309
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,649
method sevens what do you like to rock

310
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,269
for eye protection when you're at Three

311
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,639
Rivers under that sea of Gavita 'he's

312
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,919
the research I've done suggests that

313
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,289
working under HPS lights unprotected for

314
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,539
extended periods of time long-term may

315
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:43,149
cause some scary effects on eye and skin

316
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:45,759
health also do you wear long sleeves I

317
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,769
recently started to as an effort to cut

318
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,139
down on the allergic reactions on my

319
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,710
arms from being elbow deep in trichomes

320
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,600
all day

321
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,810
and I figure it also helps minimize my

322
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,310
skin's daily UV exposure any insight

323
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:00,069
would be much appreciated

324
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,329
thanks dude also I wanted to let you

325
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,399
know I've been jamming some Gregory

326
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,639
Isaac and dabbing on some key lime pie

327
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,250

and you're tuned in for the growth of

359
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:06,219
your heart podcast all right podcast

360
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,089
world I am back and I am heavily

361
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,730
medicated

362
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:13,120
this Skywalker batter is a little

363
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,190
heavier than I remembered I probably

364
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,089
should have only take one dab but I

365
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,940
think three was okay I'm giving it a

366
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,380
smell and the only way I can submit

367
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,510
describe it is it smells like Skywalker

368
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:27,009
you guys it's got like a coffee sort of

369
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,899
smell and I always say coffee I think a

370
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,669
lot of the og smell they have a hint of

371
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,740
coffee like if coffee was across the if

372
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,000
coffee is being roasted in the room next

373
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,459
door that's kind of what it smells like

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,120
roasted coffee with a little bit of

375
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:41,799
earth maybe in a hint of mud and I know

376
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,570
that doesn't sound appetizing but it's

377
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,139
that earthy houmous smell that I really

378
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,490
love

379
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,490
so it's like an earthy coffee

380
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,730
and then maybe a vanilla top maybe a

381
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,808
very light flavor of vanilla on the top

382
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,550
I love it

383
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,549
took a couple fat dabs got nicely

384
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:58,349
medicated

385
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:00,539
let's talk about the appearance here a

386
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,550
little bit it looks like somebody melted

387
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,679
a piece of golden butter in this glass

388
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,109
container the middle has a nice chunk

389
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,849
it's kind of like dark butter like if

390
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,000
the butter sat out and got kind of dark

391
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,889
it is that color and then around it it's

392
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,659
got a puddle and that puddle is mostly

393
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,029
Terps that's just where the terpenes

394
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,919
have leaked out and dissolved outside of

395
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,480
the the batter and the batter is sitting

396
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,709
right there in the middle as I tipped

397
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,180
the container a little bit I can see

398
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,220
that puddle of Terps run to the edge a

399
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,539
little bit so when I get myself a dab I

400
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,860
go in the middle and get some of the

401
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,299
battery part and then I rub it around

402
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,250
the edge and get some of the Terps on

403
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,139
there and then I get the full flavor I

404
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,940
get everything I want out of it this is

405
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,879
some some pretty good Skywalker batter

406
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm glad I was able to get that I wonder

407
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,850
if there is any more shot it to our

408
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,409
friends at the garden of Weeden great

409
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,470
work all right you guys I'm well

410
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:48,179
medicated let's get back into this email

411
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,590
this email was all about eye protection

412
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,870
and they're not asking mainly about eye

413
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,460
protection like eye safety warning eye

414
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,230
goggles from getting poked and while

415
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,480
mixing things they're asking more about

416
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,639
eye protection underneath all of the

417
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,740
grow lights we spend a lot of time in

418
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,419
grow rooms the grow rooms have thousand

419
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,519
watt high pressure sodium lights or

420
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,409
thousand watt metal halide lights and

421
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,569
we're in them all day and this guy

422
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:12,089
brought up a very good point so the

423
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,730
first thing I wanted to say is that your

424
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,830
eyes are the most sensitive organ in

425
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,500
your body that are exposed to the

426
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,490
elements all day long your eyes are

427
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,960
really sensitive that's the most

428
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,940
sensitive thing on the outside of your

429
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,540
body and it's also one of the things you

430
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,690
use the most I feel like I can survive

431
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,370
without my other senses I could get by

432
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,800
in the life safely and not feel

433
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,200
completely in danger and crippled all

434
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,449
the time but without my vision I don't

435
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,030
know that I could survive I wouldn't

436
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,530
want to think about that too much

437
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,389
that would be the one sense that would

438
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,429
make me the most vulnerable if it were

439
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:50,159
taken from me is my vision that's what I

440
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,409
think so protect your eyes and all costs

441
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,699
you guys not only under the lights but

442
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,899
when you're mixing when you grab a

443
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,640
bottle of nutrients and you're thinking

444
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,470
about mixing it put on goggles before

445
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,699
you grab it gloves and goggles they

446
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,410
should be sitting next to each other at

447
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,090
your workstation gloves and goggles

448
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,769
before you pick up the bottle because

449
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,660
when you pick up that bottle and of

450
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:08,460
pesticides or nutrients and you go to

451
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,959
shake it maybe the guy that used it

452
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,670
before he was in a hurry and he didn't

453
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,990
put the lid on all the way you pick up

454
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,269
that bottle you give it a little shake

455
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,649
those pesticides are those nutrients or

456
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:17,850
whatever it is could come flying up

457
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,799
right out of that bottle into your eye

458
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,629
you know you weren't doing anything but

459
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,799
just gonna mix it up and you haven't

460
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,210
even started applying it yet and you

461
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,359
already got to go to the eye doctor

462
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,920
so I protection is super important if

463
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,779
you're gonna spray something I

464
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:35,250
protection so this email addresses more

465
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,169
protection from the lights where some

466
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,600
sort of protective glasses he asked what

467
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,909
type of glasses do I wear when I'm under

468
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,629
the sea of Gavita 'he's at Three Rivers

478
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,670
but I've got another pair that's too

479

00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:10,169
well from the whites and I like that I

490
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,670
way the plants look I can see more of

491
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,799
the plant with my method sevens it's

492
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:34,620
more clear the colors are correct I can

493
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,569
identify things better just it the

494
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,830
colors are more clear on each plant I

495
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,650
can tell the difference between the

496
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,870
black cherry the Platinum tangi and the

497
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,340
critical mass by the colors a little bit

498
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,200
better the colors stand out I just like

499
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,790
seeing that I can identify if there's a

500
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,290
problem or if something's coming up I

501
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:51,629
can see it better with the method sevens

502
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:53,610
also I can tell they're protecting my

503
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:55,620
eyes better the man I've got one pair of

504
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,779
method sevens it was bought for me by

505
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,360
the company and they've got they say

506
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,949
method 7 and then they say HPS with a

507
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,078
plus on the little bottom of the lens

508
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,880
that plus means they've got an extra

509
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,009
coating that is designed for rooms with

510
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,310
more than 10 lights so I've got the

511
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,838
super protective method 7 glasses and I

512
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,309
can tell the difference when I do use

513
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,440
them and when I don't because honestly

514
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,119
sometimes I'm lazy and I Maris pond

515
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,190
scible and I don't use my method 7

516
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,739
glasses and when I'm driving home and

517
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,690
it's dark that's when I notice that I

518
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,069
[ __ ] up and didn't wear my glasses it

519
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,660
doesn't bug me during the day when I'm

520
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,159
working but when I get in the car and

521
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,650
it's dark and my eyes have to try to add

522
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,420
uh adjust the headlights coming toward

523
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,100
me they shine in the wrong directions

524
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,019
and do weird things and it's just

525
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,689
because I stressed my eyes under those

526
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,819
grow lights all day so I wear the method

527
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,559
sevens when I'm thinking about it if I'm

528
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,599
in a big grow I like the method 7

529
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,789
glasses that say HPS plus on them

530
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,519
because those are designed for larger

531
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,899
rooms for brighter rooms I prefer them

532
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,180
because I can feel a difference in

533
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,740
protection in my eyes I like them

534
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,080
because I can feel the difference after

535
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,120
work I like them because I can see the

536
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,599
difference in the plants and I like them

537
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:06,449
just because I feel like I can see the

538
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,949
room and the plants better overall and

539
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,720
nobody pays me to say this you guys

540
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,120
they're not I'm not sponsored by them I

541
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,029
paid cash for one pair and I was gifted

542
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,129
another pair by my company so I method 7

543
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,509
does not pay me this is just advice that

544
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,760
was brought up by somebody who cares

545
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:23,200
about your eyes as much as I do so the

546
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,509
method sevens work well

547
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,130
polarized glasses are not enough whether

548
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,930
they are expensive Oakley's whether

549
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,250
they're your ray-bans if they're the

550
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,009
cheap ones from the mall where you can

551
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,390
get six pair for [ __ ] 22 bucks

552
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:36,099
regular polarized glasses aren't enough

553
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,560
I don't know the science behind it I did

554
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:41,319
not do the research I can tell by my

555
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,779
eyes I can tell when I don't where my

556
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,759
method sevens the next night when I'm

557
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:47,200
that night when I'm driving home my eyes

558
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,059
are [ __ ] up when I wear the method

559
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,680
sevens I can see better and I don't have

560
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,809
as much of a struggle and I think it

561
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,640
effects my sleep as well I don't have

562
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,319
any science behind that but I feel like

563
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
when I close my eyes at night and I've

564
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,649
stressed my eyes my eyes feel

565
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,750
differently and I sleep better one of my

566
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,070
eyes weren't stressed all day there's no

567
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,750
science behind that either that's just

568
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:07,029
my body and what I think I've observed

569
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,359
myself so protect your eyes you guys you

570
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:13,089
only get one set of eyes if you think

571
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:16,059
about it the treatment for eye damage is

572
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:20,529
[ __ ] horrible my grams had to get

573
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:22,359
shots in his eyeballs and I could not

574
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:25,089
imagine that [ __ ] I am cringing right

575
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,740
now my toes are all [ __ ] tight my

576
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:29,319
stomach's all clenched my buttholes all

577
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,549
tight I can't even imagine taking that

578
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,169
he's got to lay his head back all

579
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,759
relaxed on this table on this chair

580
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,900
thing and they hold his eyeball open

581
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,549
with this thing and they tell him look

582
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,720
as far to the side as you can and he

583
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,849
looks way over then they stick a needle

584
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,180
in his eye dude and they put medicine in

585
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:45,189
his eyeball [ __ ] that you guys take care

586

00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,549
a good point so a couple hundred dollars

589
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,899
in sunglasses will make your eyes and he

590
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,339

591
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,620
eyes my graphs is gone now so doesn't

592
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,990
have to do that anymore but holy [ __ ] I

593
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,579
can bat couldn't imagine that that dude

594
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,519
that dude was a [ __ ] tougher man than

595
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:04,659
me by a long shot

596
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,700
anyway let's keep going with his email

597
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,080
answers ah this guy also says the

598
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,730
research I've done suggests working

599
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,099
under HBS lights unprotected for

600
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,870
extended periods of time can cause some

601
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,599
scary effects on the eye and the skin

602
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,949
yes absolutely

603
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,269
we are not supposed to be under those

604
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,009
kinds of lights all day so it's

605
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:22,930
definitely causing some sort of eye

606
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,819
problem cover your eyes in there we've

607
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,769
talked about that the skin you should

608
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:29,109
wear long sleeves you should have long

609
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,940
sleeves on all the time in the Gro email

610
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,719
also says do you wear long sleeves I

611
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,779
recently started to as an

612
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,370
to cut down on allergic reactions yes

613
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:39,440
you should be wearing socks long sleeves

614
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,029
not only because of the lights not only

615
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,769
because of the allergic reactions to the

616
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,509
trichomes like you're saying but because

617
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:46,009
there are pesticides in there and you're

618
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,750
just rubbing around on things all day

619
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:50,990
that are gonna irritate your skin and

620
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,369
just imagine you're not spraying the

621
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,538
pesticides on yourself but you're

622
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,918
spraying them on the plants and then

623
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:57,079
you're rubbing up on those leaves all

624
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,580
day every day you're absorbing a little

625
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,859
bit and a little bit and a little bit

626
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:02,689
and over a long time that little bit

627
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,750
could add up and cause a problem so yes

628
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,330
where I protect you wear long sleeves

629
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,919
wear gloves all the time when I walk to

630
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:13,009
the back of the grow where the work part

631
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,270
happens that's the gloves go on even if

632
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,798
I'm walking through with upper

633
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,529
management even if I'm walking through

634
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,879
just to do supervisory tasks to go find

635
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,069
the crew and let them know what the next

636
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,390
tasks are to go tell them hey guys 30

637
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,369
minutes to lunch you might want to start

638
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,380
wrapping up this part I'll put on gloves

639
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,759
then just in case I decide to grab

640
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,110
something back there I don't want to

641
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,538
touch anything in the grow area without

642
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:35,298
gloves because I treat the entire grow

643
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:37,220
as a pesticide contaminated area we've

644
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:38,000
applied pesticides to every plant in

645
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,679
every room

646
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,179
then we've walked through there with our

647
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,280
clothes and shoes and now we've dragged

648
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,440
all those pesticides everywhere it's

649
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,599
everywhere so I put on gloves I wear

650
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,500
long sleeves I had an incident where I

651
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,538
was mixing a 250 gallon reservoir with

652
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,650
nutrients and I spilled nutrients on the

653
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:56,000
edge of the reservoir because that

654
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,470
should happen you just drop a couple of

655
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,730
drops you don't think about it and then

656
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,460
you get a rag later and you clean it

657
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,710
right I didn't clean the rag before I

658
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,269
leaned on it to put my pH pin in there

659
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,340
to see what the pH was I just rested my

660
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:10,940
arm on there and stuck the pH pin in it

661
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:12,619
and I saw a pH is right okay let's get

662
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,220
off the ladder let's go get the rag to

663
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,259
clean it up

664
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,029
go wiped it up go cleaned up the tank I

665
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,869
said go wiped it up but whatever I'm

666
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:20,178
trying to tell you what happened I went

667
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,189
wiped it up I put the lid on the tank I

668
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,360
press go on the pump I kept working and

669
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,509
a few minutes later I was like oh [ __ ]

670
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,428
my arm is on fire I had fulvic acid on

671
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,140
my arm and it was [ __ ] burning and

672
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,759
I'd picked it up from resting my arm on

673
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,830
the top of the tank I know that because

674
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,298
I just wiped fulvic I just put fulvic in

675
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:36,829
the tank and I just wiped it off the top

676
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:38,058
where I spilled it and I'm pretty sure I

677
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:40,099
just stuck my arm in there wall is

678
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,960
adjusting the pH I just measured the pH

679
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,918
with the pH pin I used my right hand I

680
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,779
lean on the tank it would make perfect

681
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,160
sense I picked up full of the gas out of

682
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:47,720
my arm to burn myself

683
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,759
now if I had long sleeves that probably

684
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,200
wouldn't happened also if I had long

685
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,240
sleeves maybe I would absorbed more of

686
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,669
it and burn more of my arm I'm not sure

687
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,919
but long sleeves is always a good idea

688
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,509
in the grow also have a set of back up

689
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,100
clothes in the grow in case you do some

690
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:02,298
[ __ ] like I did and you are wearing long

691
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:04,159
sleeves and you stick your arm in the

692
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,720
folic acid then you can just go take off

693
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,370
the long-sleeve shirt clean your arm up

694
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,990
put on a fresh shirt and you'll be okay

695
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,969
should always have a backup change of

696
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,038
clothes in your grow all the way down

697
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,019
that you should have a pair of shoes a

698
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,730
pair of socks whatever kind of style

699
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,900
underwear you prefer I'm not getting

700
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,429
picky on you there if you're gonna wear

701
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,809
a cup do that I'm just kidding about

702
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,490
wearing a cup but some of you guys need

703
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:24,678
a cup in your grow whatever kind of

704
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,288
pants are gonna wear a fresh shirt if

705
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,940
you're a lady whatever kind of bra you

706
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:30,259
wear whatever kind of sports bra have a

707
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,179
whole fresh set of clothes

708
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,490
I've got long-ass dreadlocks I've got an

709
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:37,070
extra dreadlock hat and a whole extra

710
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,720
set of dreadlock whatever I've got I got

711
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:40,490
a [ __ ] hair tie and a hat and a wrap

712
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,929
like I could tie my hair up in six

713
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,400
different fashions if I needed to for

714
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,038
different situations it's all in the car

715
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,419
but just have fresh stuff because if you

716
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:48,500
spill something on yourself at work you

717
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,720
may need to get out of those clothes

718
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,609
quickly you don't want whatever

719
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,140
pesticide your une pesticide I don't

720
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,969
want any pesticide on me even if it's

721
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,500
something totally organic I don't need

722
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,579
that [ __ ] on me for any longer than it

723
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,529
needs to be there I need to change

724
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,798
clothes need to get that cleaned off of

725
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:02,389
me

726
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,940
like quickly I don't like that kind of

727
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,280
stuff so yeah wear long sleeves you guys

728
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,950
the pesticides are bad the lights are

729
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,210
bad I've been in gross I've been working

730
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,400
in gross for a long time and I've been

731
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,350
in the same grow I've three rivers I've

732
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,179
been in this grow at Three Rivers for

733
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,308
I'm counting time in my head and trying

734
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:21,740
to go quickly while I do it I've been

735
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:24,349
there for 13 or 14 months and I have

736
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,140
seen what a high-pressure sodium light

737
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:29,058
can do to a hydro table we've had the

738
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,130
same there's one table the mother plants

739
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:33,440
have been on the same area on the same

740
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,390
hydro tabletop like a botanic air eight

741
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,730
by four table and it's been there since

742
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,679
I started and the white is [ __ ]

743
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,450
eating this table you guys it's changed

744
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,460
it colors it's a totally different color

745
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,679
and it's starting to kind of break down

746
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,360
and deteriorate and it's not from the

747
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,679
nutrients because it's up on the top and

748
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,329
nutrients go in the bottom of this table

749
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,919
they go they may be touching there but

750
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:54,470
I'm certain it's the light [ __ ]

751
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,790
destroying this table also the tops of

752
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,710
the fans they're not the right color

753
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,509
anymore those white fans they're all

754
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,990
like this orange II it looks like

755
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:03,640
cigarettes

756
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,640
but it's just the light breaking it down

757
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,930
those grow lights are serious we're not

758
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,549
supposed to be that close to that much

759
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,200
light all day we were mimicking the Sun

760
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,059
for the plants and it's working and

761
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,410
we're using electricity and chemicals to

762
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,690
do it and then we were dancing around

763
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,800
under it all day and not covering our

764
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,990
skin that's something we should think

765
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,180
about don't get yourself any sort of

766
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,859
weird skin cancers for your grow they're

767
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,670
not gonna pay you enough for that it's

768
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,809
not worth it

769
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,480
you're trying to so now you're gonna

770
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,460
have to smoke more weed to not get

771
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,839
cancer from the cancer that you're

772
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,700
getting from the whites that you're

773
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,730
using to grow the weed that you're

774
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,289
smoking to not get cancer right that's

775
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,610
just gonna be a terrible cycle let's not

776
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,529
do that let's cover ourselves up you

777
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,119
guys this email is great I do try to

778
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:44,470
wear long sleeves however it gets hot as

779
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,839
[ __ ] in the gross sometimes when I catch

780
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,910
myself running around in a t-shirt you

781
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,379
guys this guy's got the right idea he

782
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,850
said it recently started as an effort to

783
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,740
cut down on allergic reactions to my

784
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:56,469
arms being elbow deep in trichomes all

785
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,140
day and I also figure it helps minimize

786
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,850
my skin's daily UV exposure then he said

787
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,620
any insight would be much appreciated I

788
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,389
think I gave you a lot of insight I feel

789
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,579
like I rambled on a lot about it cover

790
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,980
your eyes cover your arms also wear a

791
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:11,109
hat the top of your head is exposed to

792
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,539
those lights all day I'm 6 foot 5 you

793
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,929
guys I can feel those grow lights on my

794
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,690
head

795
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,460
I think it's funny I've got I'm 6 foot 5

796
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,990
and I've got dreadlocks to my knees

797
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,210
that's not a joke that's not an

798
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,009
exaggeration some of my dreadlocks are

799
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,440
as big around I'm looking for something

800
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:30,539
a similar size as the diameter of my

801
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,340
dreadlocks um there is big around as my

802
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,659
torch that's not even a joke I'm using a

803
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,730
blazer torch and a couple of my

804
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,980
dreadlocks are the diameter of this

805
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,390
torch it's not an exaggeration it's not

806
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,279
a joke there's a lot of [ __ ] hair on

807
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,420
my head I'll wrap my hair up in my head

808
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,579
and put it on top of my head and put a

809
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:50,410
hat on and I'll hear other people say

810
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:52,299
it's hot in this grow and I laugh I'm

811
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,070
touching the goddamn light with my head

812
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:55,930
bro you think you're hot come over here

813
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:58,329
get up on this ladder and hang out up at

814
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,710
my level it's hot bro so sometimes I

815
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:01,359
catch myself with it with just the

816
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,680
t-shirt on I catch myself without the

817
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,869
proper headgear without the proper

818
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,600
glasses and I noticed that I'm gonna pay

819
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:09,369
for it as I'm getting older and you know

820

care of yourself you're working

826
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:23,619
you're probably wearing long sleeves and

827
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,180
a hat and gloves and shoes and long

828
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:26,799
pants and you're working hard and

829
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,570

cannabis ambassadors we're all

844
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,269
representing this cannabis plant in our

845
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:00,099
own way if you are like I said earlier a

846
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,779
grower a smoker and activist or if

847
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:03,909
you're just curious about it if you are

848
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,799
here you are representing cannabis in

849
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,840
some sort of way please

850
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:10,329
let's all work together to do it in a

851
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,069
positive way let's all work together

852
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:13,779
let's stop working against each other in

853
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:16,480
the cannabis world we need to join

854
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:18,279
forces we need to be positive we need to

855
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,440
represent cannabis and a positive light

856
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,420
everywhere we go if we're going to

857
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,120
represent cannabis if that is your fight

858
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,250
stick with it don't embarrass cannabis

859
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,039
don't embarrass the rest of us do it

860
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,440
responsibly do it like an adult do it

861
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,509
carefully do it at the right place and

862
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,210
do it positively and let's all stick

863
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:38,740
together you guys and also keep in mind

864
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,049
that there is a time and place for

865
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,329
cannabis and cannabis activism and

866
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,730
cannabis speaking it's not always the

867
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:47,710
time and it's not always the place don't

868
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,259
go push your cannabis talk in the wrong

869
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,090
platform and embarrass yourself don't go

870
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:54,250
smelling like cannabis at the wrong

871
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:55,750
place and look like an [ __ ] have a

872
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,609
little bit of respect for places that

873
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,039
don't want you smelling like cannabis

874
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:02,379
there don't smoke cannabis in places

875
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,299
that would offend people yes we are part

876
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,130
of a revolution we are trying to do our

877
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:08,500
thing but we also need to keep in mind

878
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,000
that the dumb [ __ ] we do is what holds

879
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,980
us back from getting this plant

880
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,809
legalized and accepted when you

881
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,720
embarrass us and you make us look stupid

882
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:19,809
it puts us 10 steps backwards so please

883
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,480
be a positive ambassador for this plant

884
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,730
