name one of the fun things in the intro

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,349
that I always look for is the order in

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,750
which the guests are introduced

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,819
clockwise counter clockwise I try to do

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,459
ladies first but I smoke a lot of dabs

39
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,529
and sometimes I forget normal what are

40
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,118
those casualties pleasantries courtesies

41
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,179
common courtesies I forget some of that

42
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,399
[ __ ] I just get high and I try I try to

43
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,939
do I sometimes there's a method to my

44
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,560
madness

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,920
sometimes it just falls in place because

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,509
I'm high and that's how it went I'm

47

DMT you know what is the the most

124
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,109
interesting Canada's product you've

consumed anything gets your attention

126
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,949
cannabis why since last time I saw

127
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,418
there's some solvent less ice wax

128
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:35,860
floating around that is pretty delicious

129
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,959
Wow we got the sample a little of it

130
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,699
tonight but I also got the sample of it

131
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,579
somebody else got to show that off

132
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:45,639
before you yeah that's my friend that

133
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,409
for today it's a Lindsey she should be

134
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,699
here for the podcast I didn't invite her

135
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,500
we were just gonna do a little little

136
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,639
boy show tonight show nothing against

137
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,168

138
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,849
of Mike over do this sometimes I live

we'll be here by myself and I do what I

141
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,410
wanna do

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,430
my favorite aside in a while just

143
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:11,830
happened but before the ice wax it was

144
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:14,259
probably this 60% CBD shatter as well

145
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:20,550
it's its label the shatter it's at best

146
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,550
upon snap it's a little hot lately yeah

147
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,829
but yeah really really tasty so Mike's

148
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,379
talking about some ice wax uh what he's

149
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:35,478
talking about is some cream this is a

150
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,019
hundred and twenty micron ice wax made

151
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,029
from fresh frozen flowers ah this hash

152
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,219
is I say uh too much so I got a Quincy

153
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,359
buddy and that's something we gotta fix

154
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,080
I'll make a mental note we'll try to

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,460
quit doing that

156
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,379
sorry guys I apologize if I've been

157
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,299
doing that to you too much uh but uh

158
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,009
this has been heated with fresh frozen

159
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,658
material they take the fresh frozen

160
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,939
material and I don't know the exact

161
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:57,620
process but when it comes back it's

162
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,269
delivered to us in a cooler and we keep

163
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,728
it in a cooler and it looks like beach

164
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:03,288
sand and if you just take a little the

165
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,879
beach sand and throw it and I like heat

166
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,228
up the banger and throw it in the banger

167
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,939
you'll get a really good dad but I like

168
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,288
to take some and fold it into some

169
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,519
parchment paper and I heat up my carb

170
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:12,680
cap just a little bit I hit it with the

171
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,060
torch just for a second and then roll it

172
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,379
over it a couple times and mash it into

173
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,478
like a little patty and make it look

174
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,279
like a sheet of shatter or some pressed

175
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,719
rosin now they take dabs of it like that

176
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,559
and it burns a little better it burns a

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,740
little more evenly man it gets me really

178
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:32,870
wet as you can tell from this intro yeah

179
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:35,780
yeah we're both really baked yeah all I

180
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,490
don't think I've smoked any pho today I

181
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,709
think all of the smoking I've done has

182
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,918
been ice wax as the lady said your eyes

183
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:45,319
are red as the devil's dick Sun whoa

184
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,348
what lady said back of the angry lady

185
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,949
cop and pineapple Express okay that

186
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,360
makes more sense

187
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,889

226
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:22,969
tour friend Fred Garvin Fred ah loved

227
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,749
the podcast oh I got the wrong email on

228
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,158
the screen here we go

229
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:28,338
friend loved the podcast that we put out

230
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,139
recently about breeding seeds and how to

231
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:32,240
take care of his seed harvest he said

232
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,068
there's something that we left out let

233
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,209
me just read what Fred sent me instead

234
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,799
of stumbling through this he said

235
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,750
question about the last show you guys

236
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,028
mentioned moving seeded females outside

237
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,219
and some point in a run I'd like to do

238
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:45,759
that just wondering the right way to do

239
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,639
this I run my lights at 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

240
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,919
so what is the best transition time at 6

241
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:56,509
p.m. let's see at 6 p.m. when it usually

242
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,818
light on or ok or 6 a.m. when the lights

243
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,438
are off also here in SoCal we have about

244
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,750
14 and a half hours of white right now

245
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:04,639
so if I do this should I cut them off at

246
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,649
12 hours with some light dip or leave

247
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,500
them be all my outdoor plants are well

248
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,899
into flower alright so he's got some

249
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,120
he's got a process on his hands yeah

250
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,339
he's got some seeded females he's got

251
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,389
some plants that he it sounds like he's

252
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,399
got some plants that were hit with

253
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,589
pollen and they're seated and he wants

254
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,198
to take them outside to finish up but

255
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,399
he's been running his lights from 6 p.m.

256
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,929
to 6 a.m.

257
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,049
so basically when the sun's going down

258
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:32,870
his lights are coming on yep and he

259
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:36,199
wants to put these plants outside

260
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,769
your goal I he's gonna have to baby step

261
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,839
his way around the clock and me and

262
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,610
introduce them into the Sun slowly maybe

263
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,839
also I don't know how big they are and

264
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,039
how Hardy they are but I don't know if

265
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,980
putting these plants out into the

266
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:53,059
sunshine how your how slow you're slowly

267
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,920
you need to introduce them so shoot you

268
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,949
got a challenge there I would almost

269
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,588
start adjusting your indoor cycle to

270
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,379
match the outdoor cycle yeah you don't

271
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,300
want to you can't jump it can you you

272
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,189
can't do like six hours a day you've got

273
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:09,139
to do like half hour on either end right

274
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,960
I would almost and this may sound crazy

275
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:14,120
I would almost leave the lights off just

276
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,820
unplug them and tell and then reset the

277
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,528
schedule leave them off for a good 24 to

278
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,120
36 hours however you have to do that

279
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:22,460
just handle it like a power outage huh

280
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,799
yeah yeah but let it go for a long time

281
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,710
because you would rather interrupt a

282
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,579
light period than a dark period like

283
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:33,620
clouds happen Sun at night doesn't well

284
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,190
just naturally those clouds don't block

285
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,480
out the Sun is receiving they did but it

286
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,420
did not have to put the plant to sleep

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,180
but you don't want yeah you're not gonna

288
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:45,439
be able to get yeah I think your best

289
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,750
bet is just to start adjusting your

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
timer to the outside schedule I would

291
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,009
leave it off for like 36 hours just

292
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,330
unplug it leave it off for 24 to 36

293
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,549
hours so that those plants get that

294
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,570
solid 12 hours and then whatever that

295
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,250
next time

296
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,650
like if you're let's say you're turning

297
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,320
off at 6 a.m. some kind of stress is

298
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,549
that gonna do the plants though you've

299
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,320
been around when the powers gone out

300
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,729
here for a while or I've had remember a

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,230
long time ago I had an issue in a grow

302
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,940
room and I couldn't get enough power and

303
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,170
everything it just filled up and I

304
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,760
couldn't get the electrician here for

305
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,229
several days I was at the old house it

306
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,500
was at the old house actually yeah we

307
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,060
couldn't get an electrician around so ah

308
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,470
they just stayed off for like 36 hours

309
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,389
until the electrician could come on I

310
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,310
think it's better to put them in the

311
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,230
dark and just let them sleep they're not

312
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,689
going to get the sunshine or that light

313
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,980
for that day's growth but they're still

314
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,779
gonna keep developing he's got him

315
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,580
seated so he's got to hurry up and do

316
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:37,580
this within like a 24 to 36-hour period

317
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,139
he's only gonna miss one day of that

318
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,000
photo period he'll be alright

319
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,610
well he'll make that that photo period

320
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,159
of being outside the provider doesn't

321
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,629
kill ya yes that Sun energy is

322
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,208
definitely going to make up for that

323
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,819
that'll that just a very good point so

324
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:55,849
okay so the plan so far is to kill the

325
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:58,159
lights for 24 to 36 hours move the

326
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,259
indoor girls on to a light cycle that's

327
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,838
in line with the outdoor light cycle

328
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,430
that he's currently dealing with and

329
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,560
then he's gonna run them in and set in

330
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:09,138
and out every day or is they just gonna

331
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,938
go outside full time I did I just

332
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,909
overcomplicate no you're right where you

333
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:15,679
need to be yeah flip the unplug them let

334
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:17,419
them rest in the dark until you can get

335
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,489
the timer to come back on when the Sun

336
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,860
comes up so you're pretty much gonna

337
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,750
have to you're gonna need 36 hours from

338
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,240
your time schedule that sounds like so

339
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,339
unplug them wait until the Sun until you

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,139
can match the time of the Sun let them

341
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:31,879
get their solid 12 hours of sleep then

342
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,490
match the time of the Sun plug your

343
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:37,159
timer into that and then maybe every day

344
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,839
take them out for four or five hours and

345
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,370
pay really good attention to him and

346
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,810
just take my pay attention maybe if you

347
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,759
see him getting [ __ ] up take him in

348
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,739
the house and then do them for a little

349
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,149
longer next time a little longer but

350
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,068
maybe if they're big and healthy enough

351
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,208
it's Fred I know Fred Fred your plants

352
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,708
are healthy bro you could probably take

353
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,688
him out there and put them out there and

354
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,129
they'll be cool but keep an eye on them

355
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:57,019
keep a good eye on a be out there with

356
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,000
them they call it acclimating and it

357
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,399
really does work best in stages yeah

358
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,929
give him two hours for two days and then

359
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,659
three hours for two days that kind of

360
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,000
thing right in his next question next

361
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,679
part of his question he says that out

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,240
there in SoCal they have about fourteen

363
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,739
and a half hours of light right now so

364
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,169
if he does that should he cut them off

365
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,448
at 12 hours with some light depth or let

366
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,028
them be if you can cut them off with

367
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:23,750
light depth that would be awesome if not

368
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:25,490
here's uh an ED Rosenthal's book the

369
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,110
Oaksterdam course guide I don't remember

370
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,789
the exact title of the book but there is

371
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:34,250
a section about near and far red

372
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:36,649
lighting and the I'm I would have to

373
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,659
read it to be completely accurate but

374
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,578
one of those spectrums happens when the

375
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:44,088
Sun sets and Rises it happens when the

376
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:46,698
Sun sets and that red it's either near

377
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,100
or far red tells the plant to go to

378
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:51,109
sleep that triggers it to go to sleep so

379
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,050
I think you're 14 hours you may be

380
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,909
getting enough sleep time I'm not sure

381
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:59,149
your plants are waking up and going to

382
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:00,049
bed for their I think you're gonna get I

383
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:01,549
think it's gonna work out

384
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:04,338
I think I'm trying to say I think you'll

385
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,649
be alright if you can cover it do it if

386
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,060
if it's possible by all means just do it

387
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,889
make the extra effort and go for it and

388
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,189
then you're certain that it's gonna work

389
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,419
and if you can't build the outdoor hoop

390
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,420
house or whatever you're gonna use to

391
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,559
cover them lighten up area maybe wait

392
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:20,509
just a couple of weeks and you'll be

393
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,809
just fine well you'll be well into your

394
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,429
outdoor photo period just a few weeks

395
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:27,409
we're already at that point Jesus man

396
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,278

listen to the show but alright so friend

408
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,039
I hope we didn't give you just a whole

409
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,719
bunch of crap because we're both high

410
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,939
and we rambled a lot but hashtag they

411
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,709
liked it when we were amble yeah um cut

412
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,510
the time kind I kind of answered his

413
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,919
question the Fred's main problem that I

414
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,720
foresee is gonna be there's a reason

415
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:13,429
he's running at night and if he's like

416
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,259
they go off at 6:00 a.m. so leave them

417
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,569
off they would normally come back on at

418
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,189
6:00 p.m. don't turn them on then leave

419
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,720
them off until the Sun comes back up

420
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,980
around 6:00 dude that's what you got to

421
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,009
do figure out when the Sun comes up that

422
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,360
day so they're only gonna be offered 24

423
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:32,328
hours because he's turning them off at

424
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,759
6:00 a.m. okay you know what I'm saying

425
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:38,088
friend they've got at least what I was

426
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,860
getting at is like people run for

427
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,930
temperature reasons it's a lot easier to

428
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,389
cool your system you're right yeah at

429
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,458
night it's and sometimes in some places

430
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,769
powers cheaper and some people have day

431
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:52,189
jobs have to grow weed at night right

432
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:55,028
yeah right but depending on what RIT

433
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,209
Fred's reasons are for going tonight he

434
00:15:55,028 --> 00:16:00,708
is definitely gonna have some work to

435
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,659
figure out so I'm adjusting about a

436
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,909
36-hour window there to figure it out so

437
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,679
cut the timer get them on the same

438
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:08,569
schedule as the outside if you can i

439
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,028
that's the best I could tell you for

440
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,810
that part then start taking them outside

441
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:14,610
slowly or

442
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:16,399
I'm off for 36 hours and then take them

443
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,509
outside if that's what you have to do oh

444
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,100
and then if you need to put them in the

445
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,740
hoop house to get them dark do that and

446
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,649
if not I think you'll be okay but I

447
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:30,240
could be wrong to be totally honest but

448
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:32,759
I think about 13 14 hours you should be

449
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:40,409
getting enough nighttime photo period

450
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:42,330
for those plants but be careful there

451
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:44,278
yes Fred I hope we answered your

452
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,860
question I hope we helped you I hope I

453
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,588
get a couple packs of those seeds when

454
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,909

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:33,090
next part of the show we got an email

471
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,890
from a friend who he has a problem let

472
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,269
me just read the email he says hey Russ

473
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,550
- love the show maybe you can help me

474
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:40,200
recover from a huge mistake I think I

475
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:43,169
may have mislabeled two different plants

476
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,360
when I was cloning them now I think five

477
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,370
are Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] and five were

478
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,559
Master Kush how should I go about making

479
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,349
sure I clone and properly label said

480
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,690
plants then he says should I take a

481
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:56,730
clone of each plant and label them mom

482
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,970
and clone with a certain tag and do all

483
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:02,370
ten or should I make more than one clone

484
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,679
of each I know after I clone I need to

485
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:08,909
toss the moms into bloom after I see

486
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,710
roots so it sounds like this dude had a

487
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,320
mother plant and took clones took ten

488
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,990
clones and may have mislabeled those ten

489
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,740
clones he's hoping he took five and five

490
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,630
and lost all 10 labels as well basically

491
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,319
what I'm getting right I'm hoping he at

492
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,200
least had the mother plants out properly

493
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,809
and took five

494
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,460
five I'm hoping that that one yeah

495
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,779
that's that's I didn't even think about

496
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,590
that part when I read the question that

497
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,809
first time is the real answer to this is

498
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:40,059
is proper labeling from the get-go in

499
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,069
how each grower goes about that is

500
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,349
wildly different right well I'll give

501
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:45,909
him my advice in props for admitting

502
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:47,529
that you may have made a mistake but in

503
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,930
your pothead mind you probably did it

504
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:52,269
just fine dan you're paranoid but let's

505
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,460
say he asks first of all now I think

506
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,809
fiber this and fiber this how should I

507
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,990
go about making sure I clone and

508
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,789
properly label said plants okay take all

509
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,519
10 of those plants and set them in a

510
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,319
straight line of a row and then grab one

511
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,559
plant the one that's in the front of the

512
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:12,069
row and take back to an area and get

513
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,440
some white duct tape and write a on that

514
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:16,000
one and then cut as many clones as you

515
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,450
can cut from it without killing that

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,339
plant and label all of those clones very

517
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,990
clearly however you if you cut them into

518
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:26,199
rapid rooters if you cut them into an

519
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,089
easy cloner label them a and then take

520
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,850
that plant that's labeled a and put it

521
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:32,259
somewhere else now go get the next plant

522
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:34,240
that's in that straight line filled with

523
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:36,490
plants and carry it over to the cloning

524
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,650
area get that white duct tape right a be

525
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,480
on their label that [ __ ] B and

526
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,420
then take as many clones as you can get

527
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,370
off of plant that is now number B get as

528
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,710
many clones as you can and label them

529
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:49,299
carefully B that's what you got to do I

530
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,610
think my friend I think that's what's

531
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,409
got to happen it's it's all in setting

532
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,389
it up from the get-go I used to help a

533
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,640
dude clone a hundred two hundred clones

534
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,150
at a time from six eight ten different

535
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,620
strains and everything got labeled when

536
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,040
they're in that obnoxious little pup

537
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:10,239
tent cloner we'd cut little slivers out

538
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,220
of a solo cup and use those as little

539
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,900
label pegs to go in racks to the plug

540
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,759
yeah other people use little labels

541
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,200
those little just plant label sticks I

542
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,670
just use those and write on those and

543
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,100
stick them in the neoprene is how I do

544
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,810
it I've seen ones that look like it

545
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,309
almost looks like a little flag that you

546
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,759
would stick in like a sandwich or

547
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,399
something

548
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,170
a pic yeah that stick right in the plugs

549
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,660
that make it real easy how cute

550
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:38,220
but like keeping your labels good from

551
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,220
the get-go is the best way here

552
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:44,410
as long as you make sure you've got a

553
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:46,149
healthy clone from your mother when you

554
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,950
flour that out like you'll be able to

555
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,750
tell oh this one's more cushy this one's

556
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,759
right yeah hopefully within like four or

557
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,950
five to six weeks you'll know which and

558
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,849
as long as you go ahead and get your

559
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:01,990
labels right when you clone next you'll

560
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:04,119
know for sure okay um these clones are

561
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,250
definitely from plant a these clones are

562
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,929
definitely from Plan B once you [ __ ]

563
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,500
fit once you finally finish it out

564
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,600
you'll know okay plant a rusty Alaskan

565
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,710
plan well you can do so once you're

566
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,240
gonna take cuts right and you're gonna

567
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,100
have hopefully three highlights take

568
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,589
three cuts I've got OCD that works in

569
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:22,419
groups of threes so I take take three

570
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,799
cuts and then take mother plant a mother

571
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,930
plant be lining back up in the grow room

572
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,089
all pretty let your clones root as soon

573
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,710
as you see roots on there put them into

574
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,059
their next stage which is usually a cup

575
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,440
for me some people use a little one

576
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,240
gallon pot whatever you want to do put

577
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,100
it in the next step and then take that

578
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,140
one that you cut the clone from it's

579
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,179
already grown it's already big I just go

580
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,310
flower that one all right that's what

581
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,580
the plan called for I think you just

582
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,990
have to make sure he gets his genetics

583
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,579
toss the moms into bloom after I see

584
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,589
roots oh yeah yeah there you go exactly

585
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,819
bro so I think you figured out what you

586
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:54,339
got to do you have to take clones from

587
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,509
every one of them and then the best part

588
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:59,169
is now you're gonna have a bunch of

589
00:21:55,509 --> 00:22:01,000
clones to grow next time right if you're

590
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,680
if you're not sure at this point what

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,839
you're what you're about to flower out

592
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,250
is and you're not a hundred percent sure

593
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:11,169
you've got its genetics preserved in a

594
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,579
healthy clone just go ahead and take

595
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,779
another clone and then give it yeah I

596
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:15,699
mean you only have to give it a few days

597
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,690
if you only take three clones four

598
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,940
clones off of it

599
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,100
unless your mother plant is really like

600
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,259
oh I don't know if he's still got a

601
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:25,059
mother plant like the original mom that

602
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,349
these five of each clones came from I

603
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,759
don't know where that is in this story

604
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,349
so I'm just assuming he doesn't have

605
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,450
that I'm assuming all he's got are these

606
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:33,279
ten clones yep and he's gonna figure out

607
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,600
what it easily be that way hopefully

608
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,000
hopefully there's five and five

609
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,990
I watched you clone and nugget you were

610
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,380
handed wants don't tell people all the

611
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,910
like alive you can you can preserve the

612
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,000
genetics a few months we were at a

613
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,919
garden

614
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,960
somebody was trying to be nice and

615
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,059
blessed me by cutting off a fresh little

616
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,440
tiny bottom bud and I like try that out

617
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,668
and check it out cuz I wasn't gonna see

618
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,140
the guy for a while and I wasn't gonna

619
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,210
get a chance to taste the medicine when

620
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,280
it finished and he gave me it still had

621
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,919
leaves on it it still as beautiful as

622
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,690
fresh off the bud and we're driving and

623
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,280
mike said you know you should do is you

624
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,370
should try to clone that because it was

625
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,859
a plastic we really wished we had yeah

626
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:14,629
and it worked it worked i cloned it and

627
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,668
it took a long time to revert that bud

628
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,620
back into a usable plant but i was able

629
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,840
to clone that plant we had that strain

630
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:24,739
around fer and it was kind of a [ __ ]

631
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:27,259
mutant of it but it the flavor but it's

632
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,450
still with the same you know yeah but so

633
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,220
i did clone a flower but it took a long

634
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,259
time to revert it the leaves did a bunch

635
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,089
of spirally weird twisty [ __ ] but yeah

636
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,038
i've done some crazy things so dude what

637
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,808
you got to do I'm gonna recap then we're

638
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,308
gonna move on take clones from all of

639
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:42,109
them as many clones as you can afford to

640
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,970
take space wise and without murdering

641
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,589
that plant then while you're taking

642
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,029
those clones carefully shape that plan

643
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,490
to something that would flower nicely

644
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,990
then carry those to the flower room when

645
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,190

there's a list of cons that you can come

665
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:34,329
up with once we talk about this sure

666
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:38,090
so today the Colorado meed

667
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:39,980
stated that does it start today I was

668
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,359
told it started today starting today

669
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,190
well then by the time this recording

670
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,019
comes out it was harder to change this

671
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,919
rule this rule was changed in the

672
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:52,639
legislature I believe ok if I'm not

673
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,320
mistaken the the legislators wrote it

674
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,780
passed it it was signed by the governor

675
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,089
and the meed implemented it today nice

676
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,769
ok I didn't even think this is gonna

677
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:01,869
pass its

678
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:04,629
really really really nice nice little

679
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,979
gift to the industry we just built up so

680
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,850

696
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,980
today

697
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,200
out-of-state shoppers were limited to 7

698
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,769
grams of raw cannabis on their purchase

699
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,750
yep now those same shoppers folks who

700
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,039
are over 21 and have an ID that can

701
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,960
prove so if they're from out of state

702
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,079
they are able to purchase one ounce of

703
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,340
cannabis product like a stay D just like

704
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:08,589
someone that lives here you can walk in

705
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:11,769
and buy 1 ounce yeah [ __ ] that native

706
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:13,779
sticker now you're equals now we're all

707
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,879
equals you can come here and buy just

708
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,589
the same amount of marijuana as anybody

709
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,790
else yeah and you're allowed to possess

710
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:20,709
it the only problem is there's still

711
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:23,109
nowhere to smoke it that's still an

712
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,440
issue that's thank God there was another

713
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:29,349
rule that was it was passed last last

714
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,820
November it was supposed to go in effect

715
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:35,009
in January and they kick it down the

716
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:37,960
road so October that was gonna restrict

717
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:40,150
out-of-state folks uh edible wise and

718
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,769
they're gonna crank down those limits

719
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,460
quite a bit but I think all that just

720
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,259
went out the window

721
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,289
good I love it when they toss [ __ ] out

722
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:49,269

723
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:50,740

you want to put this podcast back on

809
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:31,430
some rails Colorado's miles we've been

810
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:32,750
all over the place since we started so I

811
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,580
know if you're coming from out of state

812
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,680
you can now purchase an ounce of can buy

813
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:39,230
an ounce people welcome to the club yeah

814
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,820
yeah you can eat more plastic chairs

815
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,049
little plastic table at dinner for you

816
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,279
now you don't have to drive to four

817
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,169
different dispensaries to have an ounce

818
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,769
of weed or run to your car four times

819
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:50,690
sold we made them drive around the store

820
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:52,400
legitimately caused traffic issues do

821
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,250
you think do you think people are gonna

822
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,340
try to do that buy more ounces do you

823
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,079
think that's gonna happen I think you

824
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:02,779
said you wanted a list of the the

825
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:06,230
benefits and the cons and I think that's

826
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:09,049
the con I think the [ __ ] from two

827
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,870
states over that comes here drops his

828
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:15,019
monthly paycheck drives all that home

829
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:17,809
and flips it a couple of times a year I

830
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:19,190
think that's gonna get a little or at

831
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,200
least has the potential to get a little

832
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,299
worse and the more of those idiots that

833
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,460
get caught the worst we look the more

834
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,200

838
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,480
cannabis industry is under a lot of fire

none of that exists here anymore we got

855
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:13,849
rid of all of it just go to the store

856
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,529
you like at this point if the jar you

857
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,449
like and you buy as much as you can

858
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:19,579
afford and then you go home and puff yep

859
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,080
but every time another package gets

860
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:22,970
count the mail or another putz from

861
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,559
another snake it's got with 300 plants

862
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,610
in his backyard going but I thought we

863
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:32,179
was legal here like the whole industry

864
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:33,919
takes a huge hit and if we take enough

865
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,990
of those were done and I really like my

866

891
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,310
5 6 7 8 nope gonna have to do trend 2

892
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,230
transactions so you're gonna have to

893
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:36,409
ride your car why cuz that's the rule

894
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,180
deal with it just 7 um I have ludicrous

895
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,800
metaphors to just shut people up

896
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,779
immediately with oh that this is

897
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:42,589
ludicrous how do you guys know just shut

898
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,869
up I don't want to have that

899
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:46,669
conversation or ninth time today so I've

900
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,579
got senses that just shut it down but we

901
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,170
get we get rid of all of that I hope

902
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:53,629
they leave the edibles and the

903
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,060
concentrates purchasing limits alone

904
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,370
those don't get it end up still getting

905
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:59,839
cranked down in November um it makes

906
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,039
stuff so much easier on us we're the

907
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,500
only industry on the planet where you

908
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,779
can't buy what you can pay for right oh

909
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,789
yeah when you think about what purchase

910
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,349
limits is actually mean and where they

911
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:12,289
apply elsewhere in the world it's just

912
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,250
nuts and now I think something that's

913
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:15,110
helpful is now you could try more

914
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,760
variety before you'd go and you'd get an

915
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,349
eighth of that an eighth of that then

916
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,260
that's what you got to smoke on yep now

917
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:24,980
you get a real variety with a pork or

918
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:29,060
rice on you yeah it is seven grams

919
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:31,519
instead of two eighths or a quarter you

920
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:35,059
pay a lot more you miss out on another

921
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,860
price breaks okay I'm so picking up four

922
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:38,659
eighths is a lot better economically

923
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:43,370
than picking up seven grams split four

924
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,529
ways per gram oh yeah okay leave by

925
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,329
miles all right and then you get more

926
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:50,720
herb that's one of the advantages your

927
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:52,489
weed weed store dude fewer trips you

928
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,589
have to go to and from the dispensary

929
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,879
less times even those stand in line you

930
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,500
have to don't have to do with that

931
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,420
[ __ ] security guard as many times

932
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,489
have to pull out your ID in your card

933
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,530

the ATM and pull out money as many times

935
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,590
and go see some person that doesn't

936
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:12,559

you a lot of knowledge and then of

944
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:26,480
course if your legal limit is an ounce

945
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:27,889
why can't we buy an ounce yeah like duh

946
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,809
that seems weird don't make me go to

947
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:31,129
four places to get my legal limit are

948
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,170
you just trying to make me shop at four

949
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,250
different places right do you think

950
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:39,829
places are gonna lose business because

951
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,659
the guys that are going to buy the guys

952
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:43,219
there are obviously people who come from

953
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,719
out of town or out of state to do this

954
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:47,299
they come and they just buy stuff to go

955
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,489
to that the second shop that wasn't like

956
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,650
shop a gets hit first like their

957
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:53,299
favorite shop the shop that has exact

958
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,389
price to the best selection whatever

959
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,750
that is shotty lose three quarters shop

960
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:01,460
be losses at least a second visit or

961
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,809
does he go to shop B and buy a whole

962
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,000
nother ounce cuz now it's that much

963
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,650
easier it really I think the people that

964
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,219
were doing that anyway cuz a lot of

965
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,440
shops

966
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:11,689
to make four visits so they just made

967
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,389
four visits at a maid for visits at B or

968
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,599
went to a went to be a go to a went to

969
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:19,848
be went to a damn we would have people

970
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,400
[ __ ] about like how far apart we were

971
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,260
from the others from time to time in the

972
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,579
bud room they like yeah the day I don't

973
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,900
know make the drive one more time

974
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,980
getting getting a little dizzy

975
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,910
it's like quit being a douche

976
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:38,300
don't tell us about it just do it

977
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:39,649
alright yes so we've got a little list

978
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,060
of pros and cons so I'm really happy

979
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,700
this rule passed it makes my life

980
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:45,739
simpler it has the potential to increase

981
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:47,659
business a little bit but not not

982
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:49,699
dramatically that to the people to the

983
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:51,139
better dispensaries the like we're

984
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:52,489
talking about maybe that second and

985
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,750
third tier dispensary are gonna lose

986
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:55,368
that second quarter that would have

987
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,750
gotten sold think I had money for a half

988
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:58,250
he's probably just gonna buy that whole

989
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,389
half ounce at the good shop now if he

990
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,510
was gonna buy it now it's gonna buy it

991
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:04,969
all there the the other little downside

992
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:08,960
is everyone that moved here from

993
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:12,049
marijuana had it a big incentive to go

994
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,849
get their ID changed when they went to

995
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,890
the DMV and got their ID change they got

996
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:19,369
registered to vote we make that very

997
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:23,088
easy here and that's gonna slow down

998
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:25,309
just a little bit I think um that's just

999
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:26,960
another little negative in the negative

1000
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,789
column piece there's not a lot of

1001
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,659
negatives to this it's nice I didn't

1002
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,869
think of how that went

1003
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:35,690
as long as taxes don't torpedo it forest

1004
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,369
like I'm really happy about this but

1005
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,990
yeah I've pretty much everyone I talked

1006
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:40,880
to the moved here for marijuana so I

1007
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:42,949
kept getting my ID switched registered

1008
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,930
smart that's because about for you in

1009
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:45,889
November like that's pretty helpful yeah

1010
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,480
I didn't even think of that cuz I've

1011
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,309
been a resident for so long that I never

1012
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,630
thought about who is which my ID and

1013
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:53,900
you're not dealing with the crowd at the

1014
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,640
door like I am the people I talked to

1015
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,800
were are inquiring about how to go

1016
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,989
medical Dan you work for a medical

1017
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,519
dispensary right but yeah in the grow

1018
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:03,529
even so you're not even handling

1019
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,239
patients yeah I go there occasionally a

1020
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,369
drop off product and I go purchase my

1021
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,829
own products but I spent very little

1022
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,440
time there but I see patients come and

1023
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,690
go and if I see the first wave when they

1024
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,940
get here basically I think they just

1025
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,619
enacted a new rule it starts either the

1026
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,760
first it starts on the first of July I

1027
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:21,650
think

1028
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,330
if you are trying to use your extended

1029
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,490
plant count at a medical facility you

1030
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:27,319
have to be a member of that facility now

1031
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:29,539
is that an official rule I knew that was

1032
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,250
the policy that a lot of shops had yeah

1033
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:32,719
they've made an official rule is what I

1034
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,969
think I saw on the door at one of the

1035
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:39,679
stores and they're really looking to

1036
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:41,509
crack down on some some of the abuses

1037
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,609
that can take place right uncle market

1038
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,460
they're going overboard in my opinion

1039
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:48,530
but like they've had it they've got

1040
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,820
enough really shady [ __ ] that like it

1041
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,860
I'm not surprised the regulators are

1042
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,140
pissed and cracking down Colorado people

1043
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,120
with the medical card um if that shit's

1044
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:57,829
getting close to expiring go renew it

1045
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,769
because it's taking a long time for my

1046
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:02,360
renewal to come in yep yeah and here's

1047
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:03,769
what sucks you can't shop if you don't

1048
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,599
have your actual card if your old

1049
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:08,480
cardigan you can only go get your new

1050
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,460
card 30 days before your old card

1051
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,889
expires you can't renew within 30 days

1052
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:16,159
of the old one expiring but it takes

1053
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:18,079
about 45 days for your new card to come

1054
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,420
in the mail and you're not allowed to

1055
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,639
shop in a dispensary until you have that

1056
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,809
new permanent card in the mail so

1057
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,389
there's going to be about it

1058
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:28,130
right now it's been a couple week before

1059
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:29,960
I've been able to shop depending on how

1060
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,760
you plan for it it can be a nasty gap

1061
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,010
and I see those people too I've got a

1062
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,390
regular doctor that I go to for my MMJ

1063
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,100
recommendation and I've got a schedule

1064
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,349
an appointment and he's been so busy it

1065
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:40,670
took me several days to get in there I

1066
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:42,409
couldn't get in as quickly as I wanted

1067
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,210
to I think there's about two weeks so

1068
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:46,159
that put me two more weeks behind and

1069
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,750
then yeah so that puts me six weeks out

1070
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:52,039
and it's taking about eight weeks I

1071
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:54,530
think oh I need a card sorry huh sorry I

1072
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,559
grow I do my thing luckily I'm stocked

1073
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:59,420
up we'll be all right life is good

1074
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,920
life is never bad wipes always good

1075
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,619

1076
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,220
a shitty time take a fat dab and fix it

1077
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:08,779
