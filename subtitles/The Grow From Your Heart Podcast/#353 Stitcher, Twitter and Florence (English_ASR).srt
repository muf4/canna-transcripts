29
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,379
show off by letting you know what I'm

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,570
smoking today I'm taking dabs of

31
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,339
blueberries citron Pham brochure from

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:19,228
apothecary farms in Colorado Springs

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,740
this is labeled as 74.8% THC and total

34
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,989
cannabinoids are 87.3% the remarkable

35
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,829
part about this concentrate is the aroma

36
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,899
and the flavor

37
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,789
it smells like clementines it smells

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,460
like sweet candied oranges rolled in

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,680
sugar then it also has a hint of purple

40
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,780
Laffy Taffy's in the background this

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,180
stuff smells delicious it tastes

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,400
incredible the high goes right to my

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,689
head it makes me ridiculously ramble it

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,310
was hard to sit still long enough to

45
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,219
record a podcast but I'm gonna do it

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,079
also the size of the Diamonds I bought a

47
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,118
four gram jar that's why it is labeled

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,029
Fambrough Jie it's a four gram jar of

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,609
concentrates the chunky diamonds in here

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,140
are ridiculous I hate to admit it but

51
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,090
I've had to break a couple of them apart

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,340
to dab them because they are just too

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,200
big for one dad it would be kind of a

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,540
waste and it would be the end of the day

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,819
so I'm dabbing the blueberry citron

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,590
Fambrough Jie from apothecary farms in

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,189
Colorado Springs and it tastes delicious

58
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,599
and I do approve

59
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,719
all right where do we want to go next

60
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,099
let's talk about stitcher stitcher is a

61
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,930
service where a lot of people were

62
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,759
attempting to listen to the podcast but

63
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,650
it was kind of giving us trouble people

64
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,090
who listen on Android devices weren't

65
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,969
able to listen on the stitcher

66
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,129
application while on the go I'm gonna

67
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,900
say it again with confidence I have

68
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,699
corrected all of the issues with

69
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,939
stitcher it should work on all devices

70
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:40,639
at this time I've tested it on several

71
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,590
devices mic has the exact device on

72
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,539
which stitcher was failing and both of

73
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,189
the new episodes have worked there so if

74
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,319
this one works on Mike's phone that is

75
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:50,449
three in a row I will feel like we have

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,129
solved the issue stitcher just put out a

77
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,689
brand new update so make sure you

78
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,329
download the new update on stitcher

79
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:57,969
radio and the show will work the old

80
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,010
episodes won't correct themselves

81
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:04,280
starting at episode 351 stitcher should

82
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:05,359
be repaired on all devices so I want to

83
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,219

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,589
who calls themselves morning dew 72

167
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,990
what's up bro he says would have been

168
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:15,228
cool to smoke with Robin Williams circa

169
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,939
Mork &amp; Mindy Robin Williams was always

170
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:18,589
hilarious he was extra funny during the

171
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,538
Mork &amp; Mindy years that would have been

172
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,978
a great time get stoned with Robin

173
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,288
Williams and watch him get goofy and

174
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:26,538
make those feel funny silly noises that

175
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:28,158
would have been hilarious so I really

176
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:30,829
appreciate that reply thanks for the

177
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:32,269
input morning dew 72 I've got another

178
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,490
screen shot with a whole bunch of great

179
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:36,288
replies this one says dude could you

180
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,968
imagine trippin with Jimmy Hendricks

181
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,860
that's because this person said they

182
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,550
would like to smoke with Jimmy Hendricks

183
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,509
and I was like bro

184
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,949
you're gonna hang with Jimmy are you

185
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,930
sure all you want to do is smoke some

186
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,430
weed so that conversation got a little

187
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,259
out of control but shot at the tip-top

188
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,509
Magoo we talked about smoking with Jimmy

189
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,550
Hendrix and we also talked about taking

190
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,719
it a little further with Jimmy of course

191
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,930
right if you're hanging out with Jimmy

192
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,700

193
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,170
reply comes from my friend Clint what's

194
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,439
up Clint good to hear from you bro Clint

195
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,720
says Trump today to try and figure out

196
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,250
what his game plan is that is a very

197
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,750
good reply I'm sure a lot of people want

198
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,790
to know what the [ __ ] his game plan is

199
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,339
and just to see Trump nice and stoned

200
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,290
that may change him that may may open

201
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,299
his eyes and may make him on our team

202
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,430
yeah I just realized I said it would

203
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,680
open his eyes hopefully it will make his

204
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,400
eyes droopy and open his heart that's

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,050
what I meant

206
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,959
let's move forward with Twitter replies

207
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,240
this one says from our friend Aldridge

208
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,189
it says my pops whenever and wherever

209
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,079
and never got the chance I knew a lot of

210
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,399
people would reach out and say they wish

211
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,050
they got a chance to smoke with their

212
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,789
old man I kind of expected that so much

213
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,500
respect for that reply thanks for that

214
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,830
one my friend then our other friend

215
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,329
Damian who goes by free-market

216
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,949
capitalist it's kind of spelled

217
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,389
awkwardly on it on Twitter but you'll

218
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,569
find it if you look for him he says

219
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,469
Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the 20s I

220
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,490
think that is a great response

221
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,070
everything was so much different in the

222
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,050
20s I bet you'll find everybody is more

223
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,839
calm and more peaceful and the

224
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,699
conversations are more rich and people

225
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,229
actually look you in the eye and there's

226
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,639
no cell phone to pull out so not

227
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,920
everybody's wondering what's happening

228
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,229
on Twitter and Instagram it would be so

229
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,610
much better to sit down and have a talk

230
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,170
then what are you gonna do at the end of

231
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,660
the Hangout when you can't pull out your

232
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,949
phone and take a little Instagram shot

233
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,770
with Hemingway you're gonna be alright

234
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,149
that's gonna be the only downfall to

235
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:25,279
that one bro I hope you get to live out

236
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,109
your dream I hope one day we get to get

237
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,079
some time-travel devices and we get to

238
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,779
legally take our cannabis with us to the

239
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,069
past and go smoke out our heroes I'm

240
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,009
gonna move forward cuz this is getting

241
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,960
weird quickly our friend couch glow on

242
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,919
Twitter said he would like to smoke with

243
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,160
Terence Mckenna

244
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,099
in 1990 I would definitely like to be a

245
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,379
part of that smoke session Terence

246
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,509
Mckenna was a an activist and a

247
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,549
spokesperson for psychedelics he may

248
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,319
have been an ethnos pharmacologist may

249
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,689
have been his official title I didn't do

250
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,980
any

251
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,690
search before the show but I think

252
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,519
that's what he went by Terence Mckenna

253
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,680
was all about psychedelics and the

254
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,199
psychedelic experience and opening your

255
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,299
mind he did not smoke a lot of cannabis

256
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,160
he was not a pothead he said the best

257
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,769
way to consume cannabis was to go for a

258
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,169
long periods of time without smoking and

259
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:15,149
then when you do smoke smoke as much as

260
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,370
you can possibly handle and that's how

261
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,529
you smoke cannabis so he had a different

262
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,539
approach than most of us but he went

263
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,970
extreme imagine if you didn't smoke for

264
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,639
60 days and you went in and took a giant

265
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,889
dab imagine how psychedelic and

266
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,019
brand-new that would be that was his

267
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,879
smoking experience every time so Terence

268
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,289
Mckenna would be a great smoking

269
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,179
experience maybe it'll get him so high

270
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,860
he can't function just a few puffs to

271
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,120
open both of your minds and then you can

272
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,340
sit there and have that talk about

273
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,840
spirituality and psyche Delia and all

274
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,639
the things that he hasn't been able to

275
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,350
talk about bro he spoke a lot so I'm

276
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,110
sure you've heard a lot of his stuff by

277
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,360
now great reply I like that thanks for

278
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,190
that one couch glow our next one says I

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,500
read an article about Willie Nelson

280
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,420
before this podcast so I imagine I have

281
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,330
to say Oh Willie and that's from our

282
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:02,219
friend mile man 50 to 80 I knew I would

283
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,440
get at least one Willie Nelson so that's

284
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,899
a great one I expected that I hope you

285
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,130
enjoy your smoke sesh with a Willie one

286
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,120
day I heard Willie could smoke some weed

287
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:14,939
so come prepared the next tweet is from

288
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,820
the Kanak rat and he said my dad passed

289
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,470
in 99 so not a fair pick but I tweeted

290
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,660
Bourdain a bunch of times jokingly

291
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,820
inviting him to burn one before he

292
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,679
passed that would have been a cool one

293
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,750
of course he means Anthony Bourdain who

294
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,219
recently passed that would have been

295
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,200
really fun he was a very creative person

296
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,740
he was very open-minded and he's been a

297
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,300
lot of places I believe he is a

298
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,060
practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and

299
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,169
he does consume cannabis regularly so he

300
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,299
would have known how to just chill out

301
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:44,129
smoke and have a conversation with you

302
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,199
that would have been a great time maybe

303
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:48,149
go eat some weird food with him maybe go

304
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,250
do some Brazilian Jujitsu that would

305
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,899
have been fun I like that there's a

306
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,529
little bit more to this tweet he also

307
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,720
says one more to break the rules one

308
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:01,379
more dead would be Joe Strummer one more

309
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,300
alive Rasta Geoff 4:20 so his choices

310
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,220
were his pops of course a lot of people

311
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,838
chose their pots I respect that then he

312
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,129
chose Anthony Bourdain which would have

313
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,440
been a lot of fun

314
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,820
chose Joe Strummer that would always be

315
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,680
a good time all the rock stars are gonna

316
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,500
be fun to smoke with and then his next

317
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,939
choice Rasta Jeff 4:20 that is an honor

318
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,250

you who i would choose to smoke with i

359
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,289
think i said in a previous episode that

360
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,620
the person i would choose to smoke with

361
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:58,259
who is dead would be my gramps i would

362
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,950
like to go back somewhere between 1995

363
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,129
and 2005 and smoke with my gramps he was

364
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,700
a really cool old guy I think around 95

365
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,860
to 2005 was when I was becoming adult

366
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,140
enough to enjoy an adult conversation

367
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,019
with him and smoke a joint with him and

368
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,480
be mature enough to take it as an adult

369
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,949
thing and not like a disrespectful kid

370
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,420
getting high with the old man sort of

371
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,980
thing I think there would have been a

372
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,279
different love

373
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,960
respect around then also he was in good

374
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,000
health at that time he was physically

375
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,680
and mentally doing pretty well in that

376
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,080
time period so there's about a 10-year

377
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,179
time frame work I think I really would

378
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,340
have enjoyed smoking a joint with my

379
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:40,069
grandpa so that would have been my my

380
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,139
dad pick my life pick that took a little

381
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,360
bit of thinking I am spoiled I live in

382
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,250
Colorado where we get a lot more

383
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,019
opportunity to smoke with a lot more

384
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,360
people I am in the cannabis industry

385
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,740
which gives me even more opportunity to

386
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,000
smoke with more people

387
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:58,430
I am a six foot five white guy with

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,860
dreadlocks almost to my knees so that

389
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,750
gives me a little more opportunity to

390
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,820
smoke with more people you guys if I go

391
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,370
to a reggae concert at a theater or a

392
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,410
small club I can just walk right past

393
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,509
security because they think I'm in the

394
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:13,189
band or part of the band so if I take

395
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,110
good herb to a reggae show when the

396
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,120
show's over I walk backstage and go

397
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,970
smoke with the reggae band it's pretty

398
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,450
easy being Rasta Geoff sometimes so I am

399
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,639
spoiled also I've made friends with some

400
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,620
folks at Comedy Works where I may end up

401
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,409
in a lot of smoke sessions with

402
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,169
comedians before and/or after comedy

403
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:34,699
shows allegedly maybe I really don't

404
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,169
want to get anybody in any trouble but

405
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,450
everybody has seen the pictures of Doug

406
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:40,879
Benson to myself smoking after the shows

407
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,379
and comedy works so I've made friends

408
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,090
with a lot of comedians like that a lot

409
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,439
of them don't want pictures of us

410
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,000
smoking out a lot of it doesn't happen

411
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,790
in a place where I can take a picture

412
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,440
but I do get spoiled I've smoked with a

413
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,870
lot of people I have smoked hash with

414
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,880
Joey Diaz I've smoked countless times

415
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,190
with Doug Benson I've gotten a few

416
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,710
comedians so high that they had to delay

417
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,930
the show and go on late one time I was

418
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,389
the only guy with weed and a pipe at the

419
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,879
high plains comedy festival where a lot

420
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,279
of headliners wanted to smoke some weed

421
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,529
so I got spoiled that day and got to

422
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,850
meet a lot of mine and your favorite

423
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,860
comedians I got to just sit in the

424
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,659
greenroom and just smoke out everybody

425
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,669
that came through that day that was a

426
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,169
great time shot it's my friend who put

427
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,879
me in that position he knows who he is

428
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:25,009
and he probably is listening right now

429
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,590
he does not want his name said thank you

430
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,110
bro I appreciate that but my point is I

431
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,180
have smoked with a lot of musicians and

432
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,120
comedians and most of the people I want

433
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:36,049
to smoke with the one person at the top

434
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,549
of my list that I

435
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,949
would like to smoke with that I have not

436
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:41,750
had the opportunity to shake his hand or

437
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,028
smoke some weed with him would be Joe

438
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,639
Rogan I would love to just meet Joe and

439
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:48,049
smoke and have a conversation I would be

440
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,019
super honored to be on the show but

441
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:52,909
there's no need for that but Joe Rogan

442
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,860
has always had my attention for years

443
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:56,389
before he got super popular I've been

444
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,490
listening to his comedy I've been

445
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,259
watching his videos I've been watching

446
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,490
the podcast since the beginning so it

447
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,100
would be an honor to smoke with Joe

448
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,159
Rogan would probably be my number one

449
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,810
pick a close second would be Snoop Dogg

450
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,480
because who doesn't want to smoke a

451
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,078
joint with Uncle Snoop imagine how fun

452
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,930
that would be

453
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,609
I think Snoop is hilarious and he's

454
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:18,199
super chill so you just smoke a joint

455
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,089
and just sit there and laugh at [ __ ]

456
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,040
probably get some food listen to some

457
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,769
good music I think it'd be a good time

458
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,419
so my first choice of living person

459
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,700
would be Rogen my backup plan would be

460
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:32,019
snoop and if I could time travel I would

461
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,129
try to smoke a joint with my gramps

462
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:35,570
imagine what's gonna happen when we time

463
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,490
travel and go back in the day and try to

464
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,410
smoke bags with these people who aren't

465
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,209
even familiar too much with cannabis

466
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:42,860
like you know what are you doing what

467
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,708
the [ __ ] happened to weed in the future

468
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,028
they're gonna be confused

469
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:49,399
alright the next part of the podcast was

470
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:50,600
inspired by my friends who were worried

471
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,570
about and who were dealing with

472
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,579
Hurricane Florence I was talking with a

473
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,500
friend who was very concerned with how

474
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:59,750
to keep his plants alive during the

475
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,399
hurricane if power goes out what is he

476
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,009
going to do to keep the environment

477
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,199
dialed in what is he going to do to keep

478
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:08,539
the lights on schedule and I had a

479
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,720
couple of pieces of advice that I feel

480
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:14,418
like really made him at ease during this

481
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,818
emergency time now my friends main

482
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,890
concern was interrupting the light cycle

483
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:20,480
he did not want to disrupt the current

484
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,130
light cycle he's on twelve twelve he's

485
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,900
in the middle of flower and he knows

486
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,329
that if he disrupts that light cycle too

487
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,759
much he gives the plants the opportunity

488
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,740
to turn into hermaphrodites which will

489
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,950
seed his crop which will potentially

490
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:37,759
cost him income now here was my main

491
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,730
piece of advice to my friend our plants

492
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,369
are tolerant of interruptions of the day

493
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,400
cycle however our plants are not

494
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:49,069
tolerant to interruptions of the night

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,060
cycle so if you have a power failure

496
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,859
during

497
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,929
the light cycle and the lights go off

498
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,799
for a little while your plants will be

499
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,450
okay

500
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,399
they won't get that light energy and

501
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,769
they'll miss that growth for that amount

502
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,340
of time but it will not turn them into

503
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:06,740
Hearns on the opposite if your plants

504
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:08,689
get light during their night cycle you

505
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,180
are definitely risking issues you are

506
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,870
risking causing hermaphrodite flowers

507
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,789
and seeds in your crop so the first

508
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,699
piece of advice was don't worry too much

509
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:22,099
about interruptions of the day cycle but

510
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,890
focus strongly on interruptions of the

511
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:26,839
night cycle my next piece of guidance

512
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,240
was that if they are getting frequent

513
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,459
interruptions in electricity and the

514
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,440
light is going on for two hours and then

515
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,559
may be off for 15 minutes and then on

516
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,710
for 15 and then off during the day cycle

517
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,599
it may be best just to unplug that light

518
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,259
until you get the electrical issues

519
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,049
solved

520
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:48,619
I think the plant would react better to

521
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,109
just having a long dark period than a

522
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,719
day where I had two hours of light and

523
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:55,519
then 15 minutes of dark and then 15

524
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,930
minutes of light and then some random

525
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,039
time of dark and then the lights went

526
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,350
off for a couple minutes and then they

527
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,210
came back on and then we had our normal

528
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,799
12 hour dark cycle and the lights came

529
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,299
on for about an hour and then they went

530
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,159
off again randomly and then they got

531
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,710
back on I would just leave the lights

532
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,240
off having them come on and on and off

533
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,789
and on like that those will probably

534
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,829
cause more issues than just an extended

535
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:18,230
dark period until the problem is solved

536
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,829
also that's gonna put stress on your

537
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,620
equipment

538
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:23,629
having the hot bulbs reignite is not

539
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,359
good for the bulbs or the ballasts so

540
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,150
avoid that I would recommend leaving on

541
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,250
the fans and the blowers until the very

542
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,230
last minute if you decide to unplug the

543
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,059
lights because they're flickering leave

544
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,620
the blowers plugged in because you still

545
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,450
want airflow in your room you don't want

546
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:40,159
it to get stale and it's not gonna hurt

547
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,259
the fans and blowers too much if they go

548
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,700
off and come on too frequently it's the

549
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,859
bulbs and ballasts that we're gonna do

550
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,870
damage to and it's also the plants that

551
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,309
are gonna get annoyed how do you like it

552
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,839
if I just walk in the room and turn the

553
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,730
lights off randomly then walk back by

554
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,009
and turn them back on it piss you off

555
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,019
eventually too so if you've got

556
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:59,029
flickering if you've got intermittent

557
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:00,889
power failures just unplug the lights

558
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:02,899
until the power is fixed and the plants

559
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,950
will probably like you for that more

560
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,690
than they would like you

561
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,819
you just let them get flickered off and

562
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,048
on through the entire storm another

563
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,700
thing to think about is you may get a

564
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,750
lot of water I'm not I've never been in

565
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,940
a hurricane I don't know what this is

566
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,179
gonna be like are you electrically safe

567
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,620
maybe just unplug things anyway you're

568
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,059
gonna have the chance of a lot of water

569
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,369
coming into that house if you were

570
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:24,829
evacuated or if you feel like the water

571
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,119
is getting close unplug your stuff so

572
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,099
that the ballasts and the bulbs aren't

573
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,719
plugged in when the water comes I don't

574
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,879
know the situation I don't know how bad

575
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,220
it's gonna get but if you were evacuated

576
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,600
unplug your [ __ ] before you leave unplug

577
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,339
everything I would just go turn off the

578
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,048
breakers just flip the breaker in the

579
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:42,500
garage make sure that there's no power

580
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:44,298
going now if you're in veg you're going

581
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,388
to need some light on your plants or

582
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:49,250
they will start to flower some plants

583
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:52,879
will start to flower within 24 hours

584
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,859
some will need 48 hours or more but if

585
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,309
we don't get some light on them they may

586
00:20:54,859 --> 00:21:00,319
start the flowering process your veg

587
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:03,019
plants don't need a lot of light for

588
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,798
very long to prevent them from flowering

589
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,808
if you have a strong battery powered

590
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,579
flashlight or one of those industrial

591
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,678
flashlights that takes the square

592
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:14,359
battery the big square battery if you've

593
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,399
got one you know what I mean if you've

594
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,369
got that type of flashlight you can

595
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:21,199
shine that over your plants for three

596
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,648
maybe seven maybe ten minutes at the

597
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,509
most

598
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:26,058
and that'll keep them awake if you do

599
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,859
that every six hours or so they'll go oh

600
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,879
we don't need the flower they go in

601
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,648
there and you wake them up they just

602
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,820
trigger them to wake up and then it

603
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:33,528
takes a little while for them to fall

604
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:35,028
back to sleep and they don't ever get

605
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:37,548
the idea that they've gotten twelve

606
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:39,558
hours of uninterrupted darkness and they

607
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:41,839
will not start to flower so just go in

608
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,369
there every six hours or so and just

609
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,569
shine a bunch of bright light on them I

610
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,388
understand you may not have electricity

611
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:49,970
that's why I'm recommending flashlights

612
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:51,888
try the weak flashlight on your phone

613
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,110
maybe that'll work if it's all you've

614
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:56,778
got hopefully you can still charge your

615
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:58,129
phone with your car so you've got a

616
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:00,019
little bit of power you've got that

617
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,419
little flashlight maybe that will work

618
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,579
for you it's gonna depend on the size of

619
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,590
the plants the age of the plants the

620
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:08,898
genetics and a lot of other things but

621
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:11,058
that's one way to prevent those plants

622
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:13,788
from going into flower during a power

623
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:16,190
outage so that's my advice for how to

624
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:17,250
handle this hurricane season and random

625
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,019
power outages

626
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,390
the most important piece of advice is to

627
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,359
make sure that you your loved ones and

628
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,850
your pets are safe if they say evacuate

629
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,529
don't be a stubborn [ __ ] evacuate

630
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,019
I get it that's all your stuff that's

631
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,700
your house that's your livelihood I get

632
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,769
it but you've got to get out of there so

633
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,660
that you don't get hurt and then nobody

634
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,430
else gets hurt trying to rescue your

635
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,220
dumb ass so get out of there when they

636
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,019
say evacuate that is my advice take care

637
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,819
of yourself take care of your family and

638
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,440
take care of your pets and if you need

639
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:49,230
to help somebody else out do what you

640
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,509
can and be very careful so that is my

641
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,279
hurricane and interrupted light cycle

642
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:54,660
advice if you have problems or you

643
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,849
suspect you'll have repeated problems

644
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,820
just unplug it and you will save

645
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:01,319
yourself some headaches you guys I know

646
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,450
these episodes have been short lately

647
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,250
I've been trying to not be so rambley

648
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,870
I've been trying to keep a lot of info

649
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,509
and a lot of details into the show

650
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:11,789
without a lot of sidetrack crap so I do

651
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,619
apologize if the episodes feel short to

652
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,389
you I feel like it's better to have a

653
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:17,459
short episode that it's to the point

654
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,200
then a rambling episode with a bunch of

655
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,390
crap for people to fast-forward through

656
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,920
I will get back to the grow lessons on

657
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,080
the next episode I just wanted to get

658
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,910
these Twitter replies out I also wanted

659
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,679
to get to this hurricane question while

660
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,390
it was kind of relevant so I do

661
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,310
understand that I've put out a couple of

662
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:35,250
really short episodes under 30 minutes

663
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,929
is really short in my opinion but I feel

664
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,400
like those episodes were right to the

665
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,289
point I'm gonna try to keep the grow

666
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,730
lessons nice and tight like that there

667
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,259
will be episodes like these where I come

668
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,569
hang out and get rambly but the grow

669
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,940
lessons are gonna be a little tighter if

670
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:49,799
the episodes don't require a long time

671
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,019
I'm just gonna do a short episode I

672
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,940
guarantee there will be longer episodes

673
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,269
because I have some highly detailed grow

674
