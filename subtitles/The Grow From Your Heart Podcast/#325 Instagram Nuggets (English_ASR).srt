gets too long let's get right into it

35
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,600
here's episode 325 of the girl from the

36
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,599
heart podcast

37
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:36,919
[Music]

38
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,200
alright so if you're trying to get all

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,969
that reclaim out of your rig so that you

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,530
can use it it's a good idea to make

41
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,789
edibles out of it if you want to dry it

42
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,200
out and smoke it you could do that but

43
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,909
edibles is probably the way to go if

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,500
you're gonna recycle your reclaim the

45
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,929
easiest way to get it out out of the rig

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,000
without destroying it is to run the tap

47
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,320
water get the tap water super hot and

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,810
then just fill the rig with hot water

49
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,398
and pour it out into a container if the

50
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,679
rig and the water are really hot it'll

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,209
come out really easily if it's cold

52
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:03,859
that shit's just gonna stick and make a

53
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:05,060
mess if you put a solvent in there to

54
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,219
loosen it up you're gonna ruin the

55
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,080
reclaim so the best way to get it out is

56
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,068
probably just hot water and pour it into

57
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,560
something and collect it

58
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,238
maybe pour it onto some parchment might

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,709
be your best bet not sure how to collect

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,330
it that way I honestly don't [ __ ] with

61
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,030
reclaim I'm a little bit stuck up I

62
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,440
throw the reclaim away another good way

63
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,299
to catch your reclaim you guys and make

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,789
it more usable and to keep it from the

65
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,830
water is a drop down simply put a drop

66
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,409
down on your rig a drop down is a piece

67
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,030
that goes from the joint of your rig it

68
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:33,409
drops down at an angle and then it goes

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,530
back up and you put your nail on the up

70
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,939
part and your reclaim will gather in the

71
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,289
bottom of the drop down instead of

72
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,509
making it into the water of your rig

73
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,819
it's more accessible and it's easier to

74
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:46,340
smoke from there than it is from the

75
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,049
water so that's what I would do with the

76
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,229
reclaim if you were trying to use it

77
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:54,709
Jessie says chem for chem D or chem 91

78
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:57,318
my answer is yes please but honestly I

79
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,259
like the chem 4 cuz it's chunky I like

80
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,969
that when you oh it smells like I think

81
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:03,768
it smells like when you open a can of

82
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:05,629
tennis balls a fresh can and tennis

83
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,629
balls has a really certain smell it's

84
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,909
like got a uh I don't know a certain it

85
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:12,799
smells like him chem 4 but it's got like

86
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:15,530
a tires kind of a thing going on I

87
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,269
really like that Kim D I don't know that

88
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,900
I've got enough experience with real Kim

89
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:26,120
D to be honest chem 91 I love that nasty

90
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,069
skunk funk terrible smell I love that so

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,530
if I want to grow it probably chem 4 if

92
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:34,388
I want to smoke it can 91 if I need more

93
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:38,770
information Kim D [ __ ] marry kill uh

94
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,600
[ __ ] Kim for Mary Kim 91 and kill Kim D

95
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,900
yes we just played around a [ __ ] marry

96
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,310
kill with cannabis strains you guys so

97
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,500
the question was what was your view on

98
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,479
11 on and 13 off to mimic the tropics

99
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,969
they're asking about light cycles 11

100
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,099
hours on 13 hours off for the plants to

101
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,930
mimic the tropics that's not a bad idea

102
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,319
it saves you an hour of electricity

103
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,770
which over a 65 day flowering cycle is

104
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,209
65 hours of light for each bulb that you

105
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,430
don't have to run that closure equipment

106
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,409
a little bit and also when you're doing

107
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,629
a phenol hunt I think a longer dark

108
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,460
period gives your plants more time to

109
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,949
show a phenol Fino typical expression

110
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,209
you'll see more variance you'll see the

111
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:18,849
plants actually do what they're supposed

112
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,738
to do it may affect your yield it may

113
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:25,240
affect positively or negatively

114
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:27,759
depending on your strain I think it was

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,590
DJ short that was saying 11 on 13 off

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,319
yes that's probably where you heard that

117
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:35,439
DJ short on a high times forum on one of

118
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,959
the panels on free weed free weed I'm

119
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,420
probably on that podcast it's probably

120
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,399
where you heard that and it's not a bad

121
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,210
idea it'll save you like I said it'll

122
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,829
save you one hour every day and over a

123
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,629
63-65 day flowering cycle that's 65

124
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,879
hours worth of electricity and if you're

125
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:55,990
running four lights at 65 times four is

126
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,670
a 240 is 270 [ __ ] right 260 hours of

127
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,050
lighting that you're saving that's quick

128
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,449
math don't [ __ ] hold me to it

129
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,780
ah but yeah it's not a bad idea it'll

130
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,370
show more phenotypic expression I think

131
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:10,479
it's not a bad idea it'll bring out more

132
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,430
flavors more Terps - the question is

133
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,900
question for you Rasta man when you do

134
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,240
an open pollination with a single male

135
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,649
do you put it in the room at the same

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,569
time as your girls when you start

137
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:22,479
flowering no that's very strained

138
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,569
dependent something like grateful dog

139
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,629
wants to be pollinated around day 25 of

140
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,540
its life of flowering lemon skunk wants

141
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:34,290
pollen closer to day 32 so I've got to

142
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,270
put the mail in the room to get him

143
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,850
pollinating to get him flowering to get

144
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,769
him pollinating to where when the

145
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,050
grateful dog plant wants pollen and the

146
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,509
lemon skunk plant wants pollen that male

147
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,400
has got pollen ready for them also I've

148
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,319
got to time it to where the lemon skunk

149
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,179
plant and that grateful dog plant are

150
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,670
ready for pollen on the same day so that

151
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,860
means I

152
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,870
got to put the mail in the room a few

153
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,129
days ahead of time just a couple days it

154
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,360
depends on what plants I'm working with

155
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,909
I know which plants I need to do this

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,110
with cuz I've done it a few times now ah

157
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,420
gotta put the mail in the room first get

158
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,009
him going I kind of put him in a

159
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,870
separate space he's far from all the

160
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,629
other ones he's isolated so he's in

161
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,430
there flowering then I will put the

162
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,290
lemon skunk in there because it's got to

163
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,120
get ahead of everybody then I will put

164
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,520
I'll wait like what is it six or seven

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,899
days let the lemons gunk get ahead then

166
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,759
we'll throw that grateful dog in there

167
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,620
so now they've at they're actually

168
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,939
perfectly timed now it sounds like one

169
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,889
winning way late and one way in early

170
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,660
but when pollen comes this one's gonna

171
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,610
have fat pistols the buds are gonna

172
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,560
start forming it's a shorter squatter

173
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,270
indica plant so it's not gonna get as

174
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,980
tall it's not gonna get it doesn't take

175
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,449
as much time to finish so it needs to be

176
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,189
pollinated earlier that lemon skunk

177
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,899
plant needs a little more time to

178
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,600
stretch out and give me all those little

179
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,729
bud sites to create seed sites so uh

180
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,830
yeah I got it I got to stagger them the

181
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,810
boy goes in first then the lemon skunk

182
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:59,269
then the grateful dog depends on what

183
00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:00,740
else I'm working with the question is

184
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,149
I've got seeds available on dang seed

185
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,189
store and somebody wants to know if the

186
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,109
blueberry cookies packs are all the same

187
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,810
or is the s-1 pack different than the

188
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,189
one not labeled s1 I'm not sure how

189
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,269
they've got them labeled on the website

190
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,889
I need to take a look and see what

191
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,629
they've gotten going on up there but

192
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:19,430
this is a good opportunity to talk about

193
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:21,439
s ones and our ones now

194
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,199
this is a label for feminized seeds

195
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,529
normally you see things like f1 or f2 or

196
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,389
BX or IBL now you're starting to see on

197
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:34,039
feminized seed packages you're seeing R

198
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:37,610
1 and s 1 R 1 means a reversal an R 1

199
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,040
means I reversed it plant and I used its

200
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,860
pollen on a different plant it's a

201
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,870
reversal an s-1 is if I were to reverse

202
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,710
a plant and put that pollen on the same

203
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,480
cultivar so that is selfing it's only

204
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,279
selfing if you're putting the pollen on

205
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,700
itself if you're putting the pollen on

206
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,069
something else it's a reversal so s1 is

207
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,769
a self 1 it's only gonna have that

208
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:03,019
plants genes in it no other no other

209
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:04,579
genetics no other adulterations it's

210
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,079
just gonna be that it is going to be

211
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,759
just blueberry cookies I took the

212
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,469
blueberry cookies girl and I put

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,019
reversed blueberry cookies pollen on

214
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:15,920
there and it is selfed that is seeds of

215
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:17,870
itself s1 now reversal if I take that

216
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,970
blueberry cookies pollen just as I did

217
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,889
and I throw it on the Platinum tangi I

218
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,450
have now made a reversal that's not a

219
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,919
self because I've opened up the line I

220
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,649
put something else in there so that's

221
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,430
the difference between an r1 and an s1 a

222
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:33,319
reversal and a self plant so the

223
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,779
conversation was we were talking about

224
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,970
reversing plants and using reversed

225
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,279
males or reversed females for breeding

226
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,529
and what the future of that holds and

227
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,509
then I was making sure to support the

228
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,250
idea of making feminized seeds there is

229
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,720
a reason for femme seeds a lot of people

230
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,700
hate on FEM seeds a lot of people bash

231
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,680
FEM seeds it's not a lot of people's cup

232
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,360
of tea a lot of people feel about FEM

233
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,789
seed the way I feel about Otto flower

234
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,919
seeds so I completely understand it but

235
00:08:55,789 --> 00:09:00,559
there is a reason and a good purpose for

236
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,839
feminized seed and here is the reason

237
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,649
why I recently reversed a clone of

238
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,330
blueberry skunk I grow for a large

239
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,340
facility

240
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,040
some of those flowers for that facility

241
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,840
were smoked by a very well-known breeder

242
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,129
who has been in this game for longer

243
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,320
than I could ever imagine

244
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:20,389
he started this [ __ ] he didn't start it

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
he was one of the first few and he's

246
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,899
still killing it he's ahead of the game

247
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,729
now I don't know if I'm supposed to

248
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,709
disclose who I did this project for or

249
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,509
not because I was actually commissioned

250
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,129
to make these seeds anyhow this breeder

251
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:41,029
who used to be well known on hash church

252
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:43,189
and I GC and overgrowth the government

253
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:48,139
com this guy was a pioneer yes he was a

254
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,640
pioneer he's one of those guys so this

255
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,679
guy smoked some of the flowers that came

256
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,179
from my facility and he said holy [ __ ]

257
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,799
that's got such an amazing flavor what

258
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,409
is that and we told him what it was and

259
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,909
he said can I have some seeds of it and

260
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,980
we said there are no seeds of that it's

261
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:04,759
kind of a clone only and he said make me

262
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,379
some seeds and that became my job I

263
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,600
reversed it to make seeds for him

264
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:10,970
because he thinks it's got some amazing

265
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,279
very unique turps and he wants to use it

266
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,200
in his breeding projects now he is in

267
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,350
another country so there's no way to get

268
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,120
him a plant safely legally discreetly I

269
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,340
can't get a clone of the blueberry

270
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,529
cookies to him we can very easily get

271
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,570
him some seeds he can get the seeds to

272
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,220
his own country it's legal for him to

273
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,320
travel there with seeds it is illegal

274
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,529
for him to travel there with a clone so

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,350
he can take the seeds so I made the

276
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,299
seeds he wants to work with that so all

277
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,550
I did was reverse the blueberry cookies

278
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:43,099
I used that pollen I put it back on a

279
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,319
blueberry cookies female and I made s1

280
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,019
seeds now that's gonna show very close

281
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,120
representations of that blueberry

282
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,439
cookies it's gonna be just like it

283
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,299
you're gonna see a little bit variance

284
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,830
closer to mom closer to dad but most of

285
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:56,990
them are going to be the blueberry

286
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,730
cookies that I started with now he's got

287
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,039
that blueberry cookies and I didn't

288
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,930
adulterate it by adding another male or

289
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,129
another female to the mix and that's

290
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,339
what would happen if I would have taken

291
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:09,710
a rise or whatever other male I've got

292
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,629
and put pollen on there I would have

293
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,910
adulterated it and watered down that

294
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,710
original genetic but now he's got the

295
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:18,860
original blueberry cookie seeds

296
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,290
it's an s1 version a selfed version of

297
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,960
the blueberry cookies it's unadulterated

298
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:26,329
so that is the advantage of working with

299
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,930
feminized seeds the main advantage in my

300
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,160
opinion also men sometimes you just want

301
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,689
to breed some [ __ ] and you don't have a

302
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,969
male of it and the best way to do it is

303
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,740
to reverse it I know that what comes

304
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,360
from that blueberry cookies reversal is

305
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,430
going to be amazing because I've seen

306
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,440
what the female blueberry cookies plant

307
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:44,929
does and I know it's phenomenal so I

308
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,030
already know that what I use it for you

309
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:49,639
can already see 5050 what's gonna happen

310
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,730
is you're working with two females so

311
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:56,990
that's the advantage of making feminized

312
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,580
see you hated on FEM seeds for years but

313
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,340
they definitely speed up your selection

314
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,340
process by years and for people in

315
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,870
Colorado now we're getting limited on

316
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,540
plant counts lower and lower

317
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,769
every time every year they drop our

318
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:12,349
plant count we used to be able to grow

319
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,909
tons of [ __ ] plants and now I've got

320
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,170
empty grow rooms because we can't grow

321
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:17,179
as many plants as we used to be allowed

322
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,919
to grow just unplug [ __ ] Gav grow

323
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,029
equipment away we're down to very low

324
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,279
numbers of plants if they keep going

325
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,230
lower it's not even gonna be worth

326
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,379
having a light so people that are

327
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,090
limited to 6 plants they want all 6 of

328
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,679
the seeds that they pop to be female

329
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,320
they don't have time to [ __ ] with a male

330
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,609
they can't run 6 because they think

331
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,650
they're gonna flower 6 they've got a

332
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,050
space they've got six pots they grow

333
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:41,149
that boy [ __ ] now I gotta wait till the

334
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:43,879
whole next cycle to run 6 I'm wasting

335
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,620
space it's so and if they can't run

336
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,580
extra they can't run 10 and then call

337
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,009
the boys because now they're already

338
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,750
over their limit so 6 is the limit they

339
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,539
got to run all 6 so that's why FEM seeds

340
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,769
are good for those folk unrelated a bit

341
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,089
I have a lot of pure sativa Sun

342
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,559
preserving and seating for future

343
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,930
generations some of these males are

344
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,869
autoflowering I get rid of those dudes

345
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,819
first yes any do that Otto flowers you

346
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,440
get the [ __ ] rid of them stress him get

347
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,780
him root bound over feed him if he

348
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,100
starts to auto flower get rid of him see

349
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,569
that's why it takes me so long to find a

350
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,800
new male you guys because I abused the

351
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,160
[ __ ] out of him before I take it to a

352
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,379
breeding room ah also here's a rant that

353
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,730
I like to give say you've got a pack of

354
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,049
10 seeds and if you're gonna breed I

355
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,759
hope you're using more than 10 seeds but

356
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,079
10 is a good number to talk about say

357
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,939
you've got 10 seeds and you're gonna

358
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,650
breed out of that pack say you're like

359
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,670
just a hobby breeder you're like oh man

360
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,259
I really want to start breeding I'm

361
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:31,699
gonna buy a pack of Rasta Jeff's cream

362
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,289
my podcast today is gonna be about the

363
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,500
cream I want to breed I wanna get a pack

364
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:36,149
of the cream and I want to breed

365
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,889
do you get a 10-pack you're gonna get

366
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,840
hopefully science dictates you're gonna

367
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,370
get five males five females or somewhere

368
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,570
in that you're gonna get four and six or

369
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,129
five and five somewhere around there

370
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,410
right so hopefully you've got I'm gonna

371
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:49,080
say for the sake of my ramble here that

372
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:51,389
we got five males and five females if

373
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,830
you're looking for a male to breed you

374
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,819
put those five females aside they don't

375
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,530
count right now they're in another room

376
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,690
we're talking about the boys that first

377
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,250
male that flowers the first one that

378
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,300
starts to drop in his balls real big cut

379
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,980
him down throw them away you don't want

380
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,809
to breed with that one at all at all at

381
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,480
all get rid of him that's the male

382
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,159
that's gonna dominate your cross that is

383
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,170
the one that is going to be just a

384
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,939
reproduction of that plant to everything

385
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:13,439
you breed if you breed it to star dog if

386
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,420
you breed it to day breaker if you breed

387
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,220
it to platinum tangi it's all gonna come

388
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,839
out like a male plant it's just gonna

389
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,120
ruin your crosses it's gonna make him

390
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,160
it's gonna be a boy it's just gonna be

391
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,970
it's just gonna be that male all over it

392
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,679
all over everything

393
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,850
so the second one you're getting a

394
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,659
little closer to what you want but if

395
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,639
you've got if you've got five boys I

396
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,799
usually find myself using the third or

397
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,419
fourth the third or fourth out of five

398
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,059
are usually what I use the first two

399
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,349
that go to dominant that third one he's

400
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,329
usually the one that's got the right

401
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,040
structure in the right shape the fourth

402
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,720
one is usually right behind there and

403
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,939
the fifth one is usually too tall that

404
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,389
boy that is way [ __ ] tall I get rid

405
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,340
of him

406
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,350
he's gonna be real dominant also if he

407
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,030
likes to stretch so say your girls are

408
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,529
two feet tall you'll have a boy that's

409
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,620
three feet tall I just get rid of him

410
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,509
I've noticed that he just makes tall

411
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,919
tall plants he just wants he makes

412
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,330
plants since one it they want to get up

413
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,579
above everybody so that when the pollen

414
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:09,230
comes down it rains down but his girls

415
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,670
also do that also it feels like huh so

416
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,409
you got a ten pack you pull out five

417
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,629
girls you got five left those first two

418
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:17,789
boys get rid of them three and four

419
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:19,769
those are your breeding prospects most

420
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,539
likely number five he's gonna be tall

421
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,329
and goofy he's probably not the one you

422
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,949
want to use all right that's just from

423
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,750
years of breeding and experimenting and

424
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,870
going through boy plants that's what I

425
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,759
have learned from looking all right

426
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,289
genetic drift bro I don't believe in

427
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,909
genetic drift I don't think I've never

428
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:37,829
seen it I've never experienced it

429
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:39,899
I've seen people [ __ ] up plants and try

430
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,879
to take unhealthy clones that are shitty

431
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,269
just because they're unhealthy but then

432
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,429
I have

433
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:47,019
been given those types of clones I'm not

434
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:48,069
saying and I'm looking at these clones

435
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,960
and these clones are great I've been

436
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,310
given terrible clones and I've revived

437
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,990
them and then cloned off of that a

438
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:55,809
hundred times and they've been stellar

439
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:59,529
dude the flow that I work with let's

440
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:03,179
talk about flow my flow has been through

441
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:06,179
hell and back I've had flow since 2007

442
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,179
2008

443
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,910
yeah and that [ __ ] puts out still she

444
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,828
has been through Moot house moves she's

445
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:17,490
been through me one time I got the flu

446
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:19,049
and I was so sick that I looked up at my

447
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,000
garden and I was like that needs water

448
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,679
and I threw up and way back to bed

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,028
that's how much I cared about my plans

450
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,188
because I was so [ __ ] sick and that

451
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:29,278
flow she almost went but she's back

452
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:31,318
cloned off of her she's alive and that

453
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,669
flow was amazing if any of my plants

454
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,870
were gonna show me some genetic drift a

455
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:36,028
flow would have told me about it she

456
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,399
would have been like look genetic drift

457
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,169
not happening dude I would have

458
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,610
experienced it by now because when I was

459
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,860
a new grower I was a horrible [ __ ]

460
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,050
cloner my grow game was on point from

461
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,699
the beginning but my clone game was weak

462
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,109
I couldn't clone for a long time

463
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,399
shout-out to my friend who got me into

464
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,019
easy cloning it taught me how to clone

465
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,639
then shove it to my new friend who

466
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,110
really stepped up my [ __ ] cloning

467
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,028
game so I don't really think that I

468
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,209
believe too much in genetic drift that's

469
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:02,039
not something that I support you get

470
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,698
some new gear the sound is great no this

471
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,958
is actually

472
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:05,548
thanks for the compliment on the sound

473
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,009
here this is the podcast equipment this

474
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:10,949
is what I record the podcast on I'm just

475
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:13,140
running into a Mackay mixer I got the

476
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:17,490
Mackay 1402 that I've had for a hundred

477
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,630
years then I run that into a dbx

478
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,578
compressor because I like the

479
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,600
compression and the gate like watch this

480
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,658
is what it really sounds like in this

481
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:29,759
room you hear all that [ __ ] noise can

482
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:33,870
you hear the hum that's my nose but

483
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,279
watch oh yeah

484
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,558
a little compression and sound gating

485
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,539
it's [ __ ] clean right yeah none of

486
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,519
that crap so it's just the podcast gear

487
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,829
got a compressor here a dbx compressor

488
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,619
to channel dbx compressor that runs into

489
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:49,619
a tascam u.s. 1200 which is what takes

490
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,079
me digital I've got a little preamp on

491
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:53,609
the mixer that gives me a little turbo

492
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,000
gives me plus 48 to make my mic a little

493
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:58,139
hotter I've got the game up quite high

494
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,579
quite high I make it I like the game

495
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,530
pretty high my mic it makes it so you

496
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,419
can hear everything I like it crispy I

497
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:04,980
got the bass turned up a little bit on

498
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,240
my voice just because it gives it a

499
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,190
little more boom and it makes me less

500
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,359
nasally because you can hear got some

501
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,400
[ __ ] in the nose it takes that out a

502
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,719
little bit I turn the compression up

503
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,610
quite high I got the gate quite high and

504
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,230
then I run through GarageBand and I

505
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:22,529
don't think you guys hear you do hear

506
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,450
the GarageBand effects also I just run a

507
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,869
noise gate on GarageBand and then

508
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,429
there's a bass booster I run two

509
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,569
different tracks at the same time on

510
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,009
Garageband they have two different

511
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,689
effects on them they layer and it just

512
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,609
makes me sound it makes it thicker and

513
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,558
bolder honestly has all it really does I

514
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:40,109
don't run any exciters or des or

515
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,039
anything and try to keep it mostly

516
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,509
simple but thanks for the sound

517
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,190
compliment thanks for letting me rant

518
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:47,009
about my sound gear I hope that made

519
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,750
sense to somebody so John Henry 1060

520
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:51,000
says how often do you change your cloner

521
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,410
water honestly I do not change the

522
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,049
cloner water those cones are only in the

523
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,610
cloner for 10 12 maybe 14 days at the

524
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,428
most I don't feel the need to change the

525
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:02,519
water what I do is I add a whole bunch

526
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,170
of clear res I've got a 180 site cloner

527
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,629
that I like to use it's the botanic air

528
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,130
180 I just prefer that one lately it

529
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,480
seems to be the most reliable the pump

530
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,880
is better the sprayers are better it

531
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,259
doesn't clog up as much so I will put

532
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,309
the water in the cloner to the desired

533
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,839
level I fill it just below the PVC halo

534
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:21,359
the water is touching the bottom of that

535
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,970
and then I add clone acts the purple

536
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,000
collect liquid solution I add that until

537
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,710
the EC is at one point one or one point

538
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,140
to you at one point o to one point to

539
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,380
just I'll hold your EC pin in there pour

540
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,670
in go ahead and pour in like 250 mils

541
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,559
spin your EC pin around in that water

542
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,940
and see what the EC is and then keep

543
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,009
adding until you get it to about one

544
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,279
point zero to one point two so now you

545
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:46,440
got water with solution in there then

546
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,460
cut your clones dip them in the clone ax

547
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,379
put them in the plugs

548
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,239
drop it in the cloner let it run for a

549
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,038
little while then that purple shits

550
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:55,169
gonna fall off of your plot your clones

551
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,579
the purple clone x gel is gonna fall

552
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,809
into the water let it run for a couple

553
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,569
hours go do some other [ __ ] and come

554
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:04,528
back unplug it pop it open and check the

555
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:06,808
pH at that point pH it to somewhere 6.0

556
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:09,298
is ideal 6.2 will work but somewhere

557
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:12,418
between 5 9 and 6 to pH that [ __ ] to 5 9

558
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:17,308
and 6 2 and you will be ideal then add

559
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,119
about 200 to 250 mils of clear rez just

560
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:20,908
pour it right in there

561
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:23,189
clear rez and then do that every 5 days

562
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,989
if you add the clear rez every every 5

563
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,639
days you will not have to change your

564
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,098
water the clear rez will take care of

565
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:30,508
any problems all right so put some clear

566
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:32,368
as in there and you don't have to change

567
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,378
the cloner water then when it's done

568
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:36,829
pour 2 cups of bleach in there and let

569
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:39,088
it keep running for quite a while and

570
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:40,648
then dump it all out and clean it out no

571
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:42,598
be fresh and throw the clone plugs away

572
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:45,538
buy new clone plugs unless you're using

573
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:47,098
permaculture using pur McClellan's clean

574
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,960
those out appropriately they tell you

575
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:50,398
how to do them any bottom so if you're

576
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,019
using those use those again shout out to

577
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:53,038
my friends at perma clone clone callers

578
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,778
if you're using the cheap ones throw

579
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,759
them away buy new ones and I suggest you

580
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:58,378
check out perma clone if you could get

581
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,528
beans from any time and place what would

582
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,528
it be

583
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,460
that's such a crazy question I'd like to

584
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,679
fly around to like three or five places

585
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,179
in the 70s and get beans before [ __ ] was

586
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,250
adulterated I'd like to go to Thailand

587
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,509
Vietnam Afghanistan and some sort of

588
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,490
South American stuff but I don't know

589
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,710
where or or I'd like to have some of

590
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,150
those seeds of the chem dog hat those 13

591
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,019
beans that chem dog had I'd like to have

592
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,019
