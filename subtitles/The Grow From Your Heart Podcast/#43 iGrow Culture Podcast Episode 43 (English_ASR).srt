here with you guys I'm not a big BHO

31
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,599
smoker so I didn't even ask that I was

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,438
going to ask that as we were uh as the

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,478
show progressed I had a BHO question for

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,319
you so I was going to see if you're a

35
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,679
Dabber I am actually I I I grew up with

36
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,118
Spencer man like come on like but but in

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
the same sense I was pampered so when

38
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,280
you smoke his chatter you can't really

39
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,319
go to smoke smoking a

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,280
dispensaries so I was just like screw it

41
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,078
on make ice wax do you smoke live resin

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,320
um I've had the pleasure of trying it a

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,438
couple of times from his personal stash

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,519

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,319

00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,640
his Tech on that one tpy turpy slurpie

47
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,639
by the time this episode airs uh in my

48
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,000
mind I feel like Spencer will have won

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,519
The Secret Cup yeah I think that's a a

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,478
safe assumption he's there now the

51
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,359
competition actually happens uh Sunday

52
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,078
night think the judging happens so by

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,399
the time this episode comes out he will

54
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,079
be the champion of the secret cup and I

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,759
can reveal what was entered um it was

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,360

183
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,759

he gave me hash so big shout out to Hank

185
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,840
uh we'll skip some shout outs for now

186
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,918
that's enough let's get on to the meat

187
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,359
of the show here we got a guy that does

188
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,000
all kinds of Organics and we've been

189
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,439
talking about a lot of grow lessons so I

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,879
guess the first question to jump right

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,918
into it dude if we just want to get down

192
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,038
to it you want to tell me uh all about

193
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,000
organic as [ __ ] uh yeah well organic as

194
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,759
a [ __ ] is just a hashtag we started

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,319
using um it's created by J I'm going

196
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,680
move like a little closer to you no

197
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,240
worried oh good there you go I just want

198
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,879
to get your well oh you're good um

199
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
important [ __ ] to say Jesse actually

200
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,279
started the hashtag I stole it off of

201
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,560
his page um but no it's the idea is that

202
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,679
uh all organic um we don't like the idea

203
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,759
of any bottled fertilizers synthetic

204
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,000
nutrients uh specifically you know

205
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:15,038
pesticides anything with mineral salts

206
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,038
map and dap uh mono um monoammonium

207
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,759
phosphates uh you know preservatives

208
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:24,279
there you go um the idea is to create a

209
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,479
clean product um food grade everything I

210
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,279
probably buy half of the products I use

211
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,680
at our local natural groceries uh so so

212
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,359
really big emphasis on growing style um

213
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,120
that's most Growers tend to focus on

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,598
flour where we focus on the soil um I

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,759
feel a lot of stuff is lost when you're

216
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,279
just focusing on weight uh High

217
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,360
vegetative yields uh you know quick

218
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:54,638
flowering times you're just losing a lot

219
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,038
of I mean money time I mean you're just

220
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,079
losing so much in that process quality

221
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,478
exactly and then hurting the environment

222
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,878
and a lot of other people the way that

223
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,158
part is What's Really Got Me interested

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
I want to learn a lot from you to maybe

225
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,800
shift my grow toward this style and my

226
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,239
reasoning is the sustainability uh I've

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,918
got a kid and she's 11 now and I keep

228
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,918
thinking about the stuff that I hear I

229
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,878
read about what they're making my

230
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,758
nutrients out of and then I'm thinking

231
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,039
about uh I toured a large grow facility

232
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,080
that runs a lot of hydro and they have

233
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,759
lots of water that has to be flushed out

234
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,399
is waste and I thought where does that

235
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,800
go that's going back to our Municipal

236
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,079
Water Supply and being filled filtered

237
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,918
out and when you get water out of the

238
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,559
sink that's what we're drinking and that

239
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:36,079
really that stuff the past few years has

240
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,158
had me think and I want to get more

241
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,000
sustainable and no offense to the hydro

242
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:44,879
shops but I love them because they help

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,879
us out but we don't need to be paying

244
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,440
overmarking [ __ ] and seabird guano and

245
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,720
make something that we can one day the

246
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,360
end of the world is coming and you can't

247
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,200
go to the hydro shop then I totally

248
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,639
agree Sean's going to out us yeah Sean's

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,839
going to outgrow all of us when that day

250
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,039
comes feel hypocritical sometimes cuz I

251
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,720
use very few products from our store as

252
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,679
well so yeah but see your store it it

253
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,200
has the option I ours is a little

254
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,439
different than most I like to think so I

255
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,959
I was pretty blown away when I first

256
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,600
walked in there and that's coming from a

257
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:20,719
guy who just who absolutely hates hydro

258
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,920
stores yeah so you're doing it uh mostly

259
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
out of the Organics for the clean

260
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,159
product for the food grade I'm

261
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,039
interested more for the sustainability

262
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,000
uh I think that's both a great reason to

263
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,439
do it one thing that got my attention

264
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,159
right off bat you said you don't use any

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,720
pesticides or non-organic pesticides I'm

266
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,879
really curious and I bet the listeners

267
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,079
are too how do you keep bugs out of your

268
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,078
crop without some nuclear attack right

269
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,239
at the beginning of the Fall here

270
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:48,599
everybody I know got three types of bugs

271
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,278
at once three letters i p m can I guess

272
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,519
what that means ladies and gentlemen

273
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,320
integrated Pest Management please write

274
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,600
that down that's important we will talk

275
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,600
about that a lot that's going to be a

276
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,240
glossery term that you need to Mark IPM

277
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,440
integrated Pest Management ion is the

278
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,039
only guaranteed form of pest control uh

279
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,079
100% if you don't want to deal with pest

280
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,958
then you have to start a program um and

281
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,838
that starts with a nice organic base uh

282
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,679
you want to start out with you know

283
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,600
things high in chit uh insect frass crab

284
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,159
meal uh things neem cake uh all of that

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,040
into the soil mix then you want to start

286
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:29,360
off on a regiment of you know silica uh

287
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,719
what else uh aloe vera you want to build

288
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,759
you want to strengthen the plant help it

289
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
build its uh cell walls basically you

290
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,120
need to build its immune system so it

291
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,559
can take care of itself so throw away

292
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,039
the bottle of pottassium

293
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,039
silicates and use the aloe vera and the

294
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,278
uh what was the other one that you said

295
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,679
that I felt would really build the cell

296
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,720
walls uh the silica we yeah silica is

297
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,000
just such an

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
underutilized uh thing in growing and

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,879
I'm pretty sure both of you guys can

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,320
contest to that and synthetics or

301
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,360
hydroorganic whatever it's all the fiber

302
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,959
growth exactly and the your Leaf wall is

303
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,000
the stronger it's going to be able to

304
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,479
stand up to attack what what do you use

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,320
to get silica in Organics uh there's a

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,839
couple of different uh options on the

307
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,120
actually there's thousands of different

308
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,639
options on the market uh potassium silic

309
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,759
is probably the number one most common

310
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,799
um it's really you know that's a good

311
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,519
one to use uh most companies sell it

312
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,479
most organic companies sell it I

313
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,839
personally use uh silica derived from

314
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,200
diamite uh through the majority of my

315
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,000
growth uh potassium silicate though does

316
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,600
have its place uh from my clones uh

317
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,759
obviously late and flour I do prefer

318
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,519
potassium Sil little more stuff that's

319
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,000
like in desicant packs in your box of

320
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,360
shoes new shoes or guys what I'm talk

321
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,958
about it it sounds like they it looks

322
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,159
like a familiar familiar word now that

323
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,958
I'm thinking about that it looks like

324
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,120
the same word on there but I that's what

325
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,719
it says on the side of those little

326
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,440
packs I think so it says desicant pack

327
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,000
on there yeah well no I think it says

328
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,639
potassium silicate it wouldn't surprise

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,559
me it's all very common stuff I mean and

330
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,159
then the diatomite the silica derived

331
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,159
from diatomite is basically dious Earth

332
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,639
which you're probably more familiar with

333
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,439
got a rough texture kind of crushes up

334
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,560
the kind of cuts up the bugs if they try

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
to get through it's like walking on

336
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,799
glass for a bug okay um so your plants

337
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,919
never get sprayed uh well actually they

338
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,679
do I uh I fure spray every day I I

339
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,360
probably Overkill my fure spray um it's

340
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,278
you know every girl likes to spend time

341

344
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,799

inoculates but that's a big part of my

349
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:50,519
spray regiment um homemade compost teas

350
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,519
fpj's ffj so fermented fruit juices

351
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,278
fermented plant juices uh that I make

352
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,519
myself and you're actually spraying that

353
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,078
on your plants spraying that on the

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,679
plants how late into flower would you do

355
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:01,439
that I usually don't go past week four

356
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,359
or five just like a traditional spray

357
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
even though it's organic uh things just

358
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,399
tend to stick

359
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,159
around okay yeah you can cause problems

360
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,519
going past week four or five I assume

361
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,159
exactly especially everything that I use

362
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,278
is very sugary yeah you know fruit

363
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,559
juices and plant juices and everything's

364
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,879
got molasses he uh he brought some nugs

365
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,399
you guys I'm not going to say that I was

366
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,600
a hater of Organics but I feel he stood

367
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,919
up for himself before anybody even

368
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,680
mentioned it he said I brought this to

369
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,399
show you that it's dense and it's odorus

370
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,799
and it's covered in tricomes and it's

371
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,639
all of that the tricomes are actually

372
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,759
real they're not tall they don't stick

373
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,799
off the bud that he showed me real far

374
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,919
but they're compacted they're everywhere

375
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,519
all over that nugget even between where

376
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,198

they're making BHO and it's funny you

391
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,838
have your little meme on the internet of

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,958
says he grows veganic and only smokes

393
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
BHO but uh I'm pretty sure there's

394
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,359
plenty of guys out there who will back

395
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,000
me on this one saying Organics produce

396
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,159
better hash um I feel the Tricom is more

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,440
fully developed you your membrane's more

398
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,919
intact you're not going to get that mus

399
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,839
I see it a lot especially when making

400
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,519
the ice wax uh as you can see this is

401
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,680
some stuff that's locally

402
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,799
grown um or actually here's the better I

403
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,078
think I smoked this the other night one

404
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,399
of your buddies had some of this yeah I

405
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:46,519
actually made it for him um this is uh I

406
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,039
believe it's organically grown um but in

407
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,159
the sense that you know you probably

408
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,958
went to the store and bought some

409
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,159
Organics organic soup exactly and then

410
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,719
you can look at this one it still has a

411
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,838
nice smell a lot of the solvent List It

412
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,560
kind of loses the odor in my opinion and

413
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,360
it's still got that dank smell

414
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:05,359
um but I believe that the that maybe the

415
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,399
it's degrading a little quicker so you

416
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,480
know check the quality of that one yeah

417
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,440
I like this I like this one a lot and

418
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,920
then check that one oh this I I hit this

440
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,680
cool at growing Kush won hi email me bro

441
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,839
you're getting a seed

442
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,318
pack some stuff should be ready couple

443
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,160
of them yeah some stuff should be ready

444
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,399
here in a couple of weeks if everything

445
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,719
goes well do you think that you were I'm

446
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,440
going to kind of back Loop here you said

447
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,440
that the tricomes have a better the

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,399
triome heads have a better casing from

449
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,959
Organics do you think that it's because

450
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,600
we're using what the plant actually

451
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,958
wants instead of feeding it junk food

452
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,040
out of a bottle exactly I I feel the

453
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,198
synthetic approaches like you said junk

454
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,838
food is just the such an appropriate

455
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,000
term um your bud are going to get denser

456
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,360
they're going to get bigger they're

457
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,039
going to get fatter does that

458
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,680
necessarily mean they're any better no I

459
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,120
mean it's only better for your wallet

460
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,879
exactly and um and we're fortunate

461
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,560
enough to be in an industry or at a

462
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,919
point in this industry where maybe that

463
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,638
doesn't matter as much anymore um so now

464
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:52,078
that people aren't all obsessed with

465
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,360
hitting you know seven pounds per light

466
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,679
uh we can focus a little bit more on

467
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,720
quality what strain was

468
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:02,519
that yeah you know was from BC uh I'm

469
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,360
pretty sure we were trimming last night

470
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,160
and uh there was one plant and that's a

471
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,279
perfect example one plant kicked out

472
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
donkey dicks a size of my arms and then

473
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,359
the Girl Scout cookies had little

474
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,880
popcorn but there was as much resin on

475
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,719
that little popcorn of Girl Scout

476
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,120
cookies as there was spread amongst that

477
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,120
entire other plant H yeah it was so dank

478
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,678
that little cookies plant is just coated

479
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,519
I'd rather grow more of those if I

480
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,720
didn't have picky patients if my

481
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,240
patients weren't demanding of the

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
Grateful Dog and other strains I'd grow

483
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,519
all cookies yeah just cuz the resin it

484
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,240
puts out it's so gorgeous cookies Yeti

485
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,599
and SF yeah there'd be some Grateful Dog

486
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,240
in there but I'd definitely have like a

487
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,798
36 Lightroom of just cookies cookies

488
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,480
cookies yeah yeah yeah little over I may

489
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,200
uh I kind of want to mention things but

490
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,919
I don't want to say too much I am in the

491
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,960
process of possibly uh taking on a

492
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,280
badass position running 227

493
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,079
lights do it I'm I if everything works

494
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,519
out within the next month I will be in

495
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,359
there growing

496
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,200
under

497
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,798
227 gavitas hell yeah I'm a little

498
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,798
stoked it's all Hydro tables it's going

499
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,599
to be fun all right so TR better triome

500
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,839
heads because of Organics does the aloe

501
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,038
vera have anything to do with that you

502
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,918
think same way it makes my skin more

503
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:21,038
Supple and doesn't burn Under the Sun or

504
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,559
under the grow light yeah and I mean you

505
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,599
know you can really go into the

506
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:28,599
properties of aloe and yucka and the

507
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,279
saponin and all of that stuff that's you

508
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,359
know 30 minutes worth of conversation

509
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,918
but bottom line is is it it increases

510
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,678
the health of your plant um silica aloe

511
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,280
coconut water those are the bases uh

512
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,000
outside of that um I'm glad you say that

513
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,079
cuz I preach those products other than

514
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
the uh the silica I'm always about aloe

515
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,798
and coconut water I teach a lot of

516
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,600
people that so yeah it's a necessity the

517
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:53,359
coconut water um extreme I drink coconut

518
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,719
water myself and I feel amazing when I

519
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,599
drink it yeah you know with the style of

520
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,400
gardening that I use I like the idea

521
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,279
that me and my plant sh the same food

522
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,919
you know the more I grow and the more I

523
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,440
evolve into this I think my plants I was

524
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,840
a vegetarian before I grew I took decent

525
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
care of myself but I think learning

526
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,399
about the plant biology has made me take

527
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,880
better care of myself and it's

528
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,320
influenced my shopping when I go to

529
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,720
Vitamin Cottage or whatever grocery

530
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,038
store I hit uh and Jesse has done it too

531
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,600
his organic practices have influenced my

532
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,759
shopping and my eating a little bit and

533
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,079
it's which in turn has affected my

534
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,359
growing because now you're here to teach

535
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,158
me how to be more healthy more

536
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,678
sustainable so I see it going full

537
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,080
circle it's there's a passion there I

538
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,600
like it yeah I I feel like people uh

539
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,319
maybe put a little bit too much emphasis

540
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,599
on the switch I mean if you're running

541
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,119
soiless and you're running Botanicare

542
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,959
you're you're almost there that's what

543
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,959
I'm saying yeah I'm just scared dude I

544
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,679
my patients love what I do and I've got

545
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,679
oh they love you even more promise I've

546
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,400
got Grateful Dog grown to Perfection you

547
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,559
know with with the way I do it and I'm

548
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,200
and I can get it that way with the few

549
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,038
strains but it's a big jump for me to

550
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,960
just go change but I may do it I'm going

551
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,720
to write down what you do and kind of

552
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,159
and I I can people are probably disag

553
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,798
agree with me on this but I don't think

554
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,240
you're going to lose yield um I swear up

555
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,440
and down that this whole Organics yields

556
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,679
less is just a a misconception in the

557
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,880
industry I mean it really is

558
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,679
unfortunately you do have people it's a

559
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
different approach than traditional

560
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,880
gardening um so you've got guys out

561
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,840
there who have been doing Hydro or soil

562
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,440
mixes for years switching to Super soils

563
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,839
and burning their plants and all

564
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,720
Organics doesn't yield anything but it

565
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,279
it reflects a lot on the grower also I

566
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,400
think somebody like you could definitely

567
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,960
just take off with it especially with

568
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,519
your experience with additives that's

569
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,480
the key okay um is with Organics you

570
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,798
start a base a lot of people like to

571
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
water never or water every time I'm

572
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,679
sorry they don't use anything but water

573
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,200
me personally I like to water never um

574
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,519
and that's kind of your style now where

575
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,840
you're giv

576
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,200
it I don't know all the product name but

577
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,798
you're giving them silica and you're

578
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,919
giving them yucka and you're giving them

579
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,679
everything that I am just just in a

580
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,120
liquid bottle I'm doing it the lazy way

581
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,720
and you know how most of that stuff is

582
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,000
made is it's a compost tea and then so

583
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,519
make like a compost tea and then they

584
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,480
basically they'll arrest fermentation um

585
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,200
so they stop and kill all the living

586
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,159
organisms in there run it through a

587
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
protein skimmer bottle it up and then

588
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,440
sell it to you um so just cut out the

589
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,640
middle man make it yourself there we go

590
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,600
by the summer guys we should all be

591
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,960
making our own NES when it's warm and

592
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,439
we're in Colorado I'm not going out in

593
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,440
the backyard and doing it this week but

594
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,759
I got a garage if I had some space by

595
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,960
the summer we'll get it going we'll all

596
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,359
be growing organic Let's Get Away we

597
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,759
have to support the hydro shops go buy

598
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,199
the Organics there get the stuff that's

599
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,679
in the Box the blood meal the bone meal

600
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,360
things if you're doing that uh get your

601
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,640
worm castings and stuff wherever you

602
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,079
locally yeah go go to hyro and make sure

603
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,840
that when you're mixing your soil talk

604
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:42,759
to Jesse about that CU he can fill you

605
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,399
in on the whole bone meal and blood meal

606
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,158
thing I'm pretty sure Jesse loves to

607
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
talk to people at hyro he loves to just

608
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,840
stand there and get paid to talk to yeah

609
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,918
you know so it's better than Advanced

610
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,240
but you know bone meal blood Mill can be

611
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,278
approved upon as well so exactly and

612
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,000
this goes back to the the veganics we

613
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,839
were kind of talking about before the

614
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,079
show uh by no means do I claim to be a

615
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,278
veganic grower we use a hashtag called

616
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,599
Beyond veganics to kind of poke fun at

617
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:12,599
it uh just for the simple fact vegan

618
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,319
growing is kind of funny just like

619
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,038
vegans are

620
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,119
right I love that how do you know

621
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,000
someone's a vegan don't worry they'll

622
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,278
tell you exactly and and that's really

623
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
how it is is you know these vegan these

624
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,798
veganic Growers are they're using just

625
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,600
bottled nutrients I mean you you know

626
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,158
that it's just plain and simple and if

627
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,839
they're not they're really depriving

628
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,080
their plants of you know certain things

629
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,079

you know as a organic grower uh I've

643
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,240
been in Colorado for about two years now

644
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,480
um before then I grew is that all I've

645
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,319
known you bro it's two years it's only

646
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,240
been two years seems like it's been a

647
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,879
long I know right time flies man um but

648
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,679
no so uh you know I have a degree in

649
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,120
horiculture I'm from North Carolina

650
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:27,400
obviously uh but back there I grew also

651
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,439
uh it was organically um small scale but

652
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,360
you I've been doing te and soil mixes

653
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,000
for a while uh coming out

654
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:37,000
here really opened my eyes to the fact

655
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,519
that you know you think you're going to

656
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,679
come out to Colorado you think you're

657
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,319
going to grow Organics you think it's

658
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,720
this big popular thing but it's all

659
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:48,158
about money um yeah but you know Jay I

660
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,798
met Jay um and then he had the high qual

661
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
these high quality castings i' I've

662
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,879
never turned back met him probably

663
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,359
within a month to being here been using

664
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,240
his castings ever since uh he does all

665
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,240
testings on his stuff you know it's

666
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,839
super high quality and that's really I

667
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,519
posted some today actually yeah and

668
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,000
that's really the key to uh basically

669
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,519
what I do is my castings um and plain

670
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,919
and simple everybody wants to know how

671
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,359
do I do it it's jce castings without a

672
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,559
microbial inoculate not microbial Source

673
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,959
I couldn't do what I do um a lot of

674
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:24,519
people Source you know reggers then B

675
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,319
worm castings from stores you know you

676
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,079
can make your own compost it's probably

677
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,319
the best way to do it your own worm

678
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,798
casting thinks it's probably the best

679
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:34,519
way to do it but at the same time a lot

680
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,038
of people I call it greenwashing um they

681
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,558
go out and they buy something because it

682
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:41,558
looks organic or it looks like it's you

683
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,639
know going to be all natural exactly

684
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:46,359
like this this environmental friendly

685
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,000
product and these companies are preying

686
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:51,119
on the consumer just like they would in

687
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,599
any other you know organic companies

688
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,038
aren't any nicer than synthetic

689
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,359
companies uh there's a company right now

690
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,278
for example that loves to kick out this

691
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,319
they throw numbers to people and you

692
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,159
know your average grow doesn't really

693
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,398
understand uh how these work but for

694
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,120
example Like Jesse was saying uh Jay

695
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:13,119
actually posted something earlier

696
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,959
um about the worm castings I'm sorry I

697
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,000
wanted to bring this up check it out do

698
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
your research I like it um but you know

699
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
for example so you've got a company out

700
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,599
there who's throwing this number around

701
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,759
like

702
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,519
30,000 plus microb you know living

703
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,398
microbes in your tea and you can use use

704
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,200
it and multiply it and you know it

705
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:36,359
sounds amazing it really does and then

706
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,038
you read Jay's test and it's like uh 6.9

707
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,599
million uh protozoa in one gram of

708
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,919
material so in one pound that's over

709
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,038
three billion protozoa that's before you

710
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,840
multiply in your Brewer so to everybody

711
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,759
out there that's using these these

712
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,519
products you know these sales pitches uh

713
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,879
I'm sorry they're sing the shake you're

714
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,319
getting seeds and stems exactly you know

715
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,600
you're you think you're getting a leg up

716
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,000
but really you're paying for an overp

717
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,480
priced Brewer and somebody to put stuff

718
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,759
in a bag for you that's all you're

719
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,159
paying when the bottled new it's a lot

720
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,599
like clothes we're paying for the label

721
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
you're paying for that Nike symbol that

722
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,000
Botanicare symbol that advanced

723
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,880
nutrients logo you know so shout out to

724
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,679
Jay he's doing it big and not only worm

725
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,520
castings um he can Source a lot of

726
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,559
things that you know grow stores can't

727
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,079
get uh Jesse can probably attend to that

728
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,398
there's a lot of things that yeah that's

729
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,519
they're just not going to be able to

730
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,639
Source he approaches it a little

731
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,200
differently and you know that's that's

732
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,000
cool yeah and once you get to a certain

733
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,960
scale it's time to adjust from being a

734
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,640
garage basement addict grower to

735
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,679
actually being a horticulturalist and

736
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,559
setting up a grow and doing horiculture

737
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,000
that's kind of what it sounds like

738
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,519
that's what Jay is more aimed for yeah

739
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,079
yeah so you got KNE meal up there uh

740
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,119
yeah he can get whatever you want nice

741
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,000
nice cool yeah I'm going to put knee

742
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,558
meal in my here's a weird question I'm

743
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,558
going to feed Botanicare will it kill my

744
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,158
NE meal if I put it in my soil before I

745
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,319
mix no you you got to the only reason

746
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,000
you really have to be careful mixing

747
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,599
synthetics and Organics is you can

748
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,960
really throw off your micro herd um you

749
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,599
feed too much of something your fungus

750
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,919
is going to feed at a faster rate than

751
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,918
your bacteria which will kill your

752
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,440
bacteria out and your fungus will

753
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,200
actually start to pull things from the

754
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,200
plant if it's not in the soil so it's a

755
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,960
balancing act uh there's a couple of

756
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,679
people I've seen on Instagram who are

757
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,960
just absolutely killing the balancing

758
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,720
act with the synthetics and Organics I

759
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,798
would never recommend it to anybody

760
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,558
that's something we talked about in the

761
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,599
last shows don't mix Stay Away unless

762
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,879
you were just extremely well-versed in

763
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,000
what you do I would highly recommend

764
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
staying away from running synthetics and

765
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,558
Organics at the same time I know a guy

766
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,080
that amends his uh uh Coco soil and he's

767
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:56,839
running full-blown uh uh General

768
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,720
Hydroponics and all that yeah these

769
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,839
probiotic guys now I've a lot of them

770
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,399
running cocoa that probiotic Farmers

771
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,839
Alliance is getting crazy it's killing

772
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,918
me I think everybody at this table knows

773
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,798
there's one grower he runs Organics all

774
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,679
the way until about week six and then he

775
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,879
starts just pummeling with like

776
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
Hammerhead and all kinds of ridiculous

777
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,679
pgrs just to make him explode and he

778
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,360
said that gives it the flavor that's his

779
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,759
but you know I'm just to each his own

780
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,879
man yeah yeah that's his grow he can do

781
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,398
what he wants in there just don't sell

782
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
it to me I heard they didn't make that

783

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
little bit about pgrs and how you feel

810
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
about

811
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,720
them I'm gonna I'm going to jump in real

812
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,079
quickly pgr stands for plant growth

813
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,558
regulator you guys and now I'm going to

814
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,519
let sea tell us about those while I take

815
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:30,038
a dab uh there's H time in place for

816
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,839
everything man um not in my food crops

817
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:34,599
at least not

818
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,278
uh synthetically made pgrs there's

819
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:41,038
obviously plenty of ways to use natural

820
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:45,480
pgrs plant hormones uh gibc acid

821
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:47,759
triol uh gibc acid gibc acid you know it

822
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,798
goes on we need to talk after the show I

823
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,558
got a buttload of that stuff there you

824
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,440
know alphalpha I do raw alphalpha I was

825
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,599
to say barley Sprouts barley Sprouts

826
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,880
which great uh barley tea every two

827
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,519
weeks my veg plants yeah I actually

828
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,840
alternate uh Alfalfa and barley for veg

829
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,519
and then corn and barley for flour I

830
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:10,158
haven't used corn yet but that's just

831
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:13,839
cuz I haven't found uh I mean I know uh

832
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,320
95 oh really cool organic yeah really

833
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:20,240
really nice it's not that expensive oh

834
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,759
no no that's um I've been yeah learning

835
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,200
that you know a lot of cool little

836
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,720
additives you don't find at Girl stores

837
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,440
although I'm going start having some

838
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,120
ferments ferments fer ferments like cold

839
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,399
processed extractions that's how you're

840
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,959
going to get your natural pgrs um

841
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,278
fermented plant juices uh basically

842
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,960
you're going to collect growing nodes

843
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,798
you're can you teach us what a pgr

844
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,038
actually is kind of explain like what it

845
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,960
is and what it does let's say like what

846
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:50,679
uh Axiom are you familiar with that yeah

847
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,200
so explain that to people so basically

848
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,720
uh basically what a pgr is is uh it

849
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,558
controls the plant's growth um so it

850
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,679
contains either real or synthetic forms

851
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,798
of plant hormones uh and then it's going

852
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,159
to make the plant react in a certain way

853
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:10,558
usually by triggering like apical

854
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:13,080
dominance or stimulating the plants s

855
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,759
there's different ways that these pgrs

856
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,960
can affect the plants but for the most

857
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,359
part uh you're just applying it to the

858
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,679
plant at a certain stage in its growth

859
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,079
cycle to make it do what you want you're

860
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,519
just manipulating nature so the most

861
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,519
popular one I think that a lot of us

862
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,480
have used in the past would be snowstorm

863
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,440
snowstorm

864
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,038
Ultra uh it's basically they've taken I

865
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,159
think it's seelp and other plant

866
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,960
proteins and concentrated them uh why

867
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
don't I want to feed that to my plants

868
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,240
and I'm just being I'm just trying to so

869
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,319
that we can get the and the thing is is

870
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,120
a lot of those you I can't really tell

871
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,439
you without looking at at the bottle uh

872
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,359
what exactly is in it but if you're

873
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,919
telling me it's the kelp um me

874
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:54,240
personally my favorite flower hardener

875
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,120
uh back when I used to use bottled

876
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,319
Organics was uh what is it moo Avalanche

877
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,678
Menino lnch um which is basically two

878
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,439
different types of kelp and molasses uh

879
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,278
so I've actually kind of adapted that to

880
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,120
my so just replace the B crap and use K

881
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:14,240
exactly just make the real deal Natural

882
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,959
Healthy pgrs versus uh exactly and that

883
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,638
goes right back into uh the fermented

884
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,720
like plant juices extracts is the way to

885
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,119
go it's basically the same idea as if

886
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,880
you want to if a human wants to get

887
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,199
ripped you shouldn't go inject steroids

888
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,919
and sit on the couch you should go to

889
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,960
the gym eat protein eat vegetables get

890
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,600
all the things you need and work out uh

891
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,360
we're not giving our plants a workout

892
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,199
we're feeding them uh energy bars and

893
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,240
protein shakes and treating them like

894
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,960
[ __ ] and expecting them to be fully

895
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,720
healthy we need balanced healthy plants

896
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,919
not just you they use these steroid

897
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,519
boosted plants they use pgrs it's so

898
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,759
funny like axium is one of the best uh

899
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,759
I've used lots of it not on my personal

900
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,480
stuff but I've seen the result no just

901
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,359
the idea of it is you know you're using

902
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,079
this synthetic to stimulate the plant's

903
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,638
s

904
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,720
AR which what is it's uh is it

905
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:03,479
systematic automated response the the

906
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,839
first word might be off I'm not even

907
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,759
sure yeah it's some sort of automated

908
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,038
response basically it's the plant's

909
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,919
ability to protect itself um and it's

910
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,798
defense mode that's the reason you know

911
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,038
the plant produces resin is to protect

912
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,839
itself basically uh and that's kind of

913
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,079
what Axiom does is it stimulates that

914
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:25,359
Chain Reaction inside of the plant so

915
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,038
it's going into def defense mode so it's

916
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,599
exactly what it's doing is it's uh

917
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:32,240
stressing the plant you have to be

918
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,439
careful uh you know Jess can probably

919
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,120
contend to this when you're messing with

920
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,519
gibberelic acid and stuff I get a lot of

921
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,079
fox tailing yeah uh when I kind of use

922
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,638
it later into flower and that's usually

923
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:46,199
with any pgr um wasn't a tlic acid at

924
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:48,918
one point was a choice for people

925
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,000
creating femin seeds yeah before they it

926
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,639
makes them too stretchy really yeah I've

927
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,839
found uh uh silver tho sulfate that I

928
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,479
make myself is the best way for

929
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,759
reversing I was meeting some with some

930
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,240
old heads this morning they were talking

931
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,798
about clal silver yeah and

932
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,759
cloning

933
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,239
man if you're going to reverse seeds

934
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:10,159
definitely make your own silver thle

935
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,799
sufate at home it's really easy to do

936
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,559
make everything at home it's really easy

937
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,119
to do yeah and just I mean if we're not

938
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:18,440
if you guys I'm going to kind of

939
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,960
apologize also if you live in an

940
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,760
apartment if you're a new grower uh if

941
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,159
you're not if you're not striving for

942
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,599
what we are D don't don't feel bad use

943
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,159
your bottles do what you can if you're a

944
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,480
medical patient and you don't have the

945
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,480
physical ability AB ility to mix this

946
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320
[ __ ] up we're not hating you we're just

947
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,079
recommending we're encouraging this is

948
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,480
no and reach out to us cuz we we

949
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,599
definitely have ways that we could help

950
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,679
you yeah you know if if you live in an

951
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,320
apartment if you are unable to mix your

952
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,960
soil or make your own teas there are

953
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,159
definitely options out there for you um

954
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,320
see that stuff community on the podcast

955
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,280
yep yeah everybody deserves the we'll

956
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,760
get Jess's awesome ass truck and we'll

957
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,399
drive up your mountain and we'll come

958
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,760
mix up soil in your yard for you and

959
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,039
we'll put it in pots and we'll carry it

960
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,640
in and hopefully you can get your

961
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,039
wheelchair the plants to water them yeah

962
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,358
I feel going yeah but I think people

963
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,000
kind of over complicate things with

964
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,960
Organics um basically if you if you want

965
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,559
to grow Organics or start growing

966
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,280
Organics I'd recommend going and finding

967
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,039
a nice and organic bottled line of

968
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,000
nutrients Roots organic General organic

969
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:21,400
age old or um you know the list goes on

970
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,480
and on and there bio bobiz biob stuff

971
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,160
pretty simple stuff too they're uh fish

972
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,679
Hydro slate is very good um yeah I used

973
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:33,719
to use it when I was back in the D but

974
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,679
uh anyways uh I'd recommend picking up a

975
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,559
nice bottled organic nutrient line uh

976
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:41,319
then outside of that go and get you some

977
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,920
nice Rocky Mount worm casting style worm

978
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,400
castings uh they the quality is

979
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,400
extremely important I cannot stress that

980
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,440
enough um find high quality worm

981
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,480
castings or find a high quality

982
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,720
microbial Source um and then molasses

983
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,800
there's your compost tea sea is pretty

984
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,719
much uh

985
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,119
uh describing the uh the way I grow yeah

986
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,559
we're supposed to call him something

987
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,480
different the whole time name

988
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,279
bro that's that's basically the way I

989
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,719
grow inside and uh I can promise you it

990
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,319
you get Stellar results and it's um you

991
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,000
know it's way better than Hydro thus for

992
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:22,318
damn sure I mean you're just replacing

993
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,079
uh you know synthetics have keates um

994
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:27,358
and that's kind of the idea of using the

995
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,680
tea with your organic bottled nutrient

996
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,279
is when you feed with your when you feed

997
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,879
with the nutrient you're putting it in

998
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,760
the soil when you're feeding with your

999
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,440
tea you're activating that soil to help

1000
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,560
it eat those nutrients to give it back

1001
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,358
into your plant that's a really good way

1002
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,159
to put that it's a great way to yeah so

1003
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:44,239
if you're if you're growing with bottled

1004
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:47,239
organic nutrients and you're not using a

1005
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,919
te of some some sort of microbial Source

1006
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:50,439
you're just hurting yourself plain and

1007
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,838
simple I have a couple of questions

1008
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,039
written down for you and stuff will you

1009
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,838
give us a quick run through um five

1010
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,239
gallon bucket on how to make a nice

1011
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,599
Jesse's done this for us but we tell us

1012
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,118
how to make a nice microbial T4 just to

1013
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,960
start off with that we can use almost

1014
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,200
anytime okay so uh yeah without a doubt

1015
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,159
uh worm castings and molasses if you

1016
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:13,960
can't get anything else just those two

1017
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,480
um and there's your microbial source and

1018
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,240
there's a food for it uh depending on

1019
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,960
your quality of castings a four A cup

1020
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,679
per gallon uh molasses depending on how

1021
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,119
often you're using it one teaspoon to

1022
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,960
one tablespoon per gallon um outside of

1023
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,280
that Kel meal is always always a good

1024
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,760
one uh kelp meal I mean if you're not

1025
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,839
familiar with the benefits of kelp you

1026
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,200
should really look it up plenty of plant

1027
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:40,440
hormones there's a decent mpk value in

1028
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:42,719
there um and then really go crazy uh

1029
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,200
just molasses earthworm castings then

1030
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,559
you can go into kelp you can go into

1031
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,559
Alfalfa depending on you know veg flower

1032
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,838
that's how you're going to kind of

1033
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,159
deliver more of an mpk value to your

1034
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:56,318
plant um do you agree with the revs uh

1035
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,199
the revs book uh true living Organics

1036
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:01,800
you know I shout out to the Rev I I read

1037
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,559
his book uh you know the Rev sub I grew

1038
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,079
up learning Organics just like everybody

1039
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:09,279
else did and I really don't agree okay

1040
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,440
with his stuff unfort I mean it's but I

1041
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,560
learned everything that I know now from

1042
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,079
his book you know it's if it if I

1043
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,000
wouldn't have went through that trial I

1044
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,960
wouldn't be where I am today so I can't

1045
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,318
be mad at him you just have to work

1046
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,800
learn what works for you I know people

1047
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,079
who have used his stuff with great

1048
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,039
success okay so he's not saying to skip

1049
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,359
it no definitely you you want to read

1050
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,159
I've seen some people crush it and have

1051
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,000
amazing buds with super soil and I've

1052
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,519
seen other people have burnt up shitty

1053
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,079
buds with super soil so it's kind of

1054
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:41,480
it's how you grow both people you know

1055
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,760
it's people are really funny about

1056
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,240
Organics uh we even with my Rocky

1057
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,880
Mountain Natural farming page we kind of

1058
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:50,479
had to take a break with post for a

1059
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,559
while um we like to put in informative

1060
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,079
posts up trying to help the community

1061
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,078
but uh we're me met with a lot of

1062
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,720
defiance oh as soon as you put up I quit

1063
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,440
posting a lot of stuff on Facebook is as

1064
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,838
soon as you put up a helpful thing 10

1065
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,400
people tell you why you're stupid for

1066
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,000
doing exactly and you know to each his

1067
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,559
own you you don't have to agree with the

1068
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,239
way I grow um you know I even if I say

1069
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,960
something wrong sure I mean it's a lot

1070
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,559
easier for you to focus on one point I

1071
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,240
got a lot of stuff I got to remember

1072
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,639
I've actually made mistakes on this

1073
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,439
podcast and I felt proud to come back

1074
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,519
and say hey guys last week I I told you

1075
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,679
the wrong way I'm sorry Like Jesse

1076
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:27,159
called me he's like you just said this

1077
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,318
oh [ __ ] I did say that but yeah I feel

1078
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:31,639
like people are getting too caught up in

1079
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:34,039
uh this growing style or that growing

1080
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:37,199
style or he grows like this or they grow

1081
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:39,039
like that and it just people need to

1082
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,279
choose their own information it's

1083
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,318
amateurish in my opinion exactly Bro

1084
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,599
Science all three of us I like that all

1085
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,800
three of us grow different ways and you

1086
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,680
know see us fighting like children you

1087
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,359
know we all but we all borrow something

1088
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,719
from each other I'm sure you've learned

1089
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,358
something you've learned something from

1090
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,279
me and I've learned five things from you

1091
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,358
and five from you CU we're all still

1092
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,800
doing the same thing

1093
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,679
I love talking to synthetic Growers um

1094
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,640
I've I've never grown marijuana

1095
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,399
synthetically uh my background is in

1096
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,239
commercial agriculture I've grown grown

1097
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,680
millions and millions of GMO horrible

1098
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,838
horrible synthetic plants um I'm not

1099
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,399
proud of it food crops food crops yeah

1100
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,838
all edible food I mean you can look on

1101
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,440
my Instagram and see them okay oh yeah

1102
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,838
uh thousands we was 30 Acres of glass

1103
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,838
green houses we would run um people got

1104
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,039
to eat but you know there's a certain

1105
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,239
point in time time that you've got to

1106
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,318
kind of figure out what means more to

1107
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,559
you is that your money or your morals

1108
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,199
you I walked away from making $45,000 a

1109
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:41,199
year which is you know it's a good bit

1110
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:42,759
for me [ __ ] student loans man but uh

1111
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,358
no you know I walked away from that and

1112
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,319
got a part-time job here in town working

1113
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:49,039
at a hydro store and just grew because

1114
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:50,920
you know it's that's what I wanted to do

1115
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,318
and I couldn't it's a lot easier to wake

1116
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,280
up and look at yourself in the mirror

1117
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,279
saying absolutely that's why I started a

1118
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,880
seed company because I got tired of well

1119
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,359
that's that's kind of what led to it but

1120
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,440
that's how I ended up self-employed I

1121
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,199
don't want to work for somebody all day

1122
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,519
for something I don't support exactly

1123
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,000
for a minimum wage and hate myself I'd

1124
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,039
rather be kind of struggling and really

1125
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,960
happy and have a cool job and have a

1126
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,480
cool job and I've got everything I want

1127
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,639

1130
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,240

a quality product we're contributing

1142
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,000
we're moving it Forward we're making the

1143
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:44,318
Cannabis a good thing instead of a scary

1144
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,079
thing I walked away from a $25 an hour

1145
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:50,039
job well they asked me to leave but so

1146
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,599
you walked away I walked away stomped

1147
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:55,119
your feet away they they actually told

1148
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,400
me uh I had to quit smoking weed and I

1149
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,680
said no so uh but yeah that's and a lot

1150
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,160
of people will tell you that that's

1151
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,960
ridiculous but you have to choose the

1152
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,719
decisions that make you yeah happiness

1153
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,240
over money is way important I don't

1154
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,000
drink a fifth of whiskey every night now

1155
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,399
oh man yeah yeah shout out to sobriety I

1156
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,559
haven't had alcohol in a long time I It

1157
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Feels So a drinker either yeah I no I

1158
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,719
still enjoy beer but I don't know if I'm

1159
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,358
really really good at drinking or really

1160
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,399
really bad at it I'm not sure which one

1161
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,880
it is but either way I'm not a big

1162
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,920
person as you can tell like I one beer

1163
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,318
wasted wow the biggest lightweight

1164
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,720
unless now I bet you two beers would

1165
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,480
crush me now yeah be silly sitting in

1166
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,239
the corner uh let's see I wanted uh you

1167
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,960
kind of told me earlier what is your

1168
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,679
average uh Harvest weight per thousand

1169
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,519
watt light running your Organics um you

1170
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:43,239
know it varies so last round we ran with

1171
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,039
the kind of like the style Jesse was

1172
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:48,519
talking about uh with the just a bottled

1173
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:50,279
nutrient kind of or a bottled organic

1174
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:55,280
you know supplemented with te's we were

1175
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,800
hitting around I say 1.7 lbs per light

1176
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,839
um this Organics guys this last grow um

1177
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,640
which is what I brought you today was

1178
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,279
grown with no bottled nutrients

1179
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,039
absolutely none I mean this is all fruit

1180
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,079
juices plant juices the calcium and I

1181
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,920
think I you run a pretty mild soil too

1182
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,359
compared to like T or super yeah I don't

1183
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,838
I I I really uh go light on my soil mix

1184
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,558
I think over mending is a big problem

1185
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,440
really impressed me about that jar you

1186
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,680
got there is that I know your your soil

1187
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,280
mix is almost minimal so I'm holding the

1188
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,719
butt up to the microphone but it's not

1189
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,880
loud

1190
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,799
enough but uh you so we hit uh I hit

1191
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,039
probably 1.2 I'm not done pulling yet

1192
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,960
I'll text you with a final weight and

1193
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,679
you can throw it up on a later show but

1194
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,838
yes right now I'm kind of looking at 1.2

1195
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,960
but that's with no bottled nutrients um

1196
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,759
and these are new strains that I'm

1197
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,559
running this round so on that do you

1198
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,200
have a favorite strain to grow um you

1199
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,920
know I'm still so I still feel so like

1200
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,439
new to the growing game um you know

1201
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,200
growing back east and kind of growing

1202
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,200
what you have to you get out here and

1203
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,279
you know so I guess Flo would probably

1204
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:04,799
be my favorite screen that's a great she

1205
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,720
loves to take good pictures too yeah um

1206
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,119
outside of the Flo citrex I think we

1207
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,919
were talking about that earlier yeah

1208
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:14,160
that one is definitely G to be in the

1209
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,280
garden for a long long time uh yeah

1210
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,558
outside of that I've grow I've had a

1211
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,359
pleasure of growing some of year gear

1212
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,760
I've growing The Grateful Dog the Heart

1213
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,558
of Gold L and Jeffrey nice I think the

1214
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,720
Heart of Gold was my personal favorite

1215
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,760
cool um it was racy to say the least

1216
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,118
yeah yeah I mean it's it's not like you

1217
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,079
wake up in the middle of the night and

1218
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,880
you accidentally grab that to put you

1219
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,280
back to sleep you [ __ ] up do not go

1220
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,480
back to sleep no not at all that one

1221
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,559
that's the Golden Goat in there the

1222
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,159
Golden Goat is definitely sativa heavy

1223
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,040
um I wish I had have taken it like a

1224
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:47,440
week longer than I how long did you let

1225
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:49,000
it go uh I think I cut it at like N9

1226
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,358
okay yeah that's good to know so yeah I

1227
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,960
think about 10 weeks is usually what I

1228
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:55,039
recommend for the hard toen it a little

1229
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:59,039
longer I took one like 76 77 days once

1230
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:01,679
nice that's uh I think probably 72s as

1231
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,920
far as i' go so DJ Short's been

1232
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,279
preaching this 1113 light cycle so I

1233
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,720
tried it oh man Sean had a reaction

1234
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,880
right away I'm glad I decided to go that

1235
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:10,759
route I had a couple of things written

1236
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,880
down a couple of ways to go so I'm glad

1237
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,200
I went that way um I'll tell you my

1238
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,318
experience but uh what did you think

1239
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:20,129
about it confusion man I just a little

1240
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,759
bit of information is a dangerous

1241
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,960
[Music]

1242
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,480
thing that's all I have to say about it

1243
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,599
uh I see I was saying see more

1244
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,159
expression the plants showed more color

1245
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,119
um a sativa strain that has never really

1246
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:38,239
Fox tailed on me kind of made fingery

1247
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,280
buds um I got a lot of color I keep

1248
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,358
saying that the color was tremendous on

1249
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,319
this run but I feel like it lowered my

1250
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,480
Harvest weight by somewhere between 10

1251
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:49,119
and 20% I'm not I haven't cut everything

1252
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,719
down yet I've got more to go but I could

1253
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,480
tell it diminished my Harvest that may

1254
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,959
have been from the cold but I really

1255
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,119
think it was from that light cycle I

1256
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,318
felt the same thing about it yeah yeah

1257
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,599
we always preach it the most important

1258
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,920
nutrient to our plants is the light yeah

1259
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,960
and so we took a full hour and that's we

1260
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,318
took 63 hours 65 hours away from our

1261
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,599
plants honestly way to put it yeah and

1262
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,960
one thing I did notice they finished

1263
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,519
quickly uh I probably saved two weeks on

1264
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,838
some of my 10 or 11 week strains they're

1265
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,800
going to finish week nine and they'll be

1266
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,799
done I I'm worried to let them go too

1267
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,559
long one may Herm out I can see it kind

1268
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,839
of getting it's pissy it's like you got

1269
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,079
to cut me down yeah yeah which is cool

1270
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,679
I'll cut her but I just wasn't ready

1271
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,599
it's uh it's a a neat tool in a breeding

1272
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,598
aspect um you know if we were testing AC

1273
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,280
cross we had made if you're looking for

1274
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,400
feno if you're feno hunting that is a

1275
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,400
good point but that's probably the only

1276
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,838
time I'll use it again but like you hear

1277
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,800
that you've got Growers and and advanced

1278
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,000
breeders and people talking about this

1279
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,800
so just please don't try this at home

1280
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
yeah it's I mean yeah there's no need

1281
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,960
for

1282
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,880
you US stick with 1212 you guys stick

1283
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,679

whole bunch you said like a quarter cup

1363
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,400

1364
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,960
cup per gallon these outrageous rates

1365
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,440
and you can use a fourth a cup I mean

1366
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,880
your 5 to 10% cutting into your soil mix

1367
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,920
is just more than enough and I use like

1368

1372
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,000
in cups for like 3 weeks you know until

1373
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:04,960

1374
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,639

consistently with your microbial tea

1376
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,118
with the worm castings in it don't add

1377
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,559
that to your other one when you feed it

1378
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,838
