00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,199
just received my ire direct order and i

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
noticed an extra 10 pack of seeds so our

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,878
friend has discovered the irie direct

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
page if you go to iregenetics.com you

65
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,318
will see the tab that says i redirect

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,920
make sure you check that out our friend

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,759
has seen that link and it says i

68
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
received my order and received an extra

69
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,280
10 pack of seeds i know you said on a

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,719
recent podcast that you do occasionally

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,479
send out testers

72
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,439
but i just wanted to make sure i didn't

73
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,199
get a whole extra pack by mistake

74
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,959
you are correct i do send out testers

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,399
but i make sure that people know they

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,598
are getting testers i make sure they can

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
run them right away that they are

78
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,000
prepared we have a conversation what you

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,919
got my friend was a gift i know that

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
people work hard for their money i know

81
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,518
that uh money is expensive the only way

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
to get money is by putting in your time

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,360
your effort and your energy we don't

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
have a lot of time uh we're bombarded by

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
life as humans so i understand that you

86
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,719

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,039

88

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
freebies with every single order so

92
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,799

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,158
hundreds of other seed makers i'm sure

96
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,598

97
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,280

113

in your favor

119
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,919
all right this next question does come

120
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,238
from the youtube channel it is a comment

121
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,759
left on a video i don't usually take

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
questions from the youtube but this one

123
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,120
looks like a good thing i should mention

124
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,279
i could ramble about for a couple of

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,199
seconds it comes from our buddy local

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,439
grow guy what's up local grow guy i hope

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
you see this episode of the show it says

128
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,560
great show brother much respect you need

129
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,478
to do a live q a show youtube followers

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,959
would love it just thought

131
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,680
just they thought much love and stay

132
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,478
safe that is a really good message um my

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,079
answer is i do a live show every monday

134
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:43,360
on instagram every monday around 7 10

135
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,719
p.m mountain time i'm in colorado i go

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
live mountain time i don't know what

137
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,000
time zone you are in i'm in mountain

138
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,478
time so every monday approximately 7 10

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,839
it could be 705 it could be 7 15.

140
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,519
sometimes the internet gives me some

141
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,879
trouble i usually get there as quickly

142
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,439
as i can about 7 10 ish i go live i take

143
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,600
dabs i hang out i answer questions and

144
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,680
everybody in the instagram is able to

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
type in and ask me questions i do my

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
best to answer every single question

147
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,000
that comes in through the instagram live

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,759
and honestly some of my favorite

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,918
questions get written down and recycled

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
and i do make a full podcast out of them

151
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,120
because i don't feel i don't i'm not

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
prepared on the live show it's like

153
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,959
stump the grower people can ask me

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
whatever they want so people ask a lot

155
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,120
of random crazy questions ask grow

156
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
questions music questions questions

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,918

10 p.m i will go live we will hang out

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,319
you'll be able to type in all of your

167
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
grow questions your random questions and

168
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,038
i will do my best to answer all of them

169
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,360
on the fly live maybe in the future i do

170
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
need to learn how to do a live uh q a on

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
youtube but for now we're sticking with

172
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,478
the instagram i do it every monday i've

173
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,959
been doing it for several years it has

174
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,719
become kind of a tradition a lot of

175
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,439
people jump in and check it out so join

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,560
us once again irie underscore genetics

177
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,639
on instagram every monday 7 10 p.m it's

178
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
not as well produced as this podcast i

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,879
edit this i write notes i have a plan

180
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
for this on monday i bring the dab rig

181
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,719
and a bunch of good dabs and a couple of

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
cold beverages and we just hang out and

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
get lit and i try to answer the

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
questions as quickly as possible as

185
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,719
accurately and thoroughly as possible

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
without any preparation any study so

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
that keeps it fun that keeps me on my

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
toes keeps my brain active also a good

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,519
time to just kind of hang out with the

190
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,959
crew and take some dabs and talk some

191
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,240
[ __ ] all right i do have another

192
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,799
question right here in front of me this

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,280
one came from patreon this comes from

194
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,680
our buddy who calls himself f a plant

195
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,839
count bro i know what you mean f your

196
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,918
plant count that's how i feel

197
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,119
let me do what i need to do although i

198
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,680
do have to follow the rules because

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
everybody knows who i am by now anyway

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
this message came from patreon shout out

201
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,598
to the patreon crew it goes a lot like

202
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
this yo rasta jeff what's up my brother

203

i hope everything is irie bro things are

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,439
pretty good uh it's a hundred and

205
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,959
something degrees outside and it is nice

206

beverage in front of me i took a few fat

208
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,478
dabs uh shout out to my friend who uh

209
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,879
teleported me manifested somehow the

210

want to uh you know anyway we're live

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,959
here on the show it says thank you for

214
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,519
answering my last question about

215
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,359
reversing a male i really appreciate it

216
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,198
i've grown a few dozen strains but i'm

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
coming across an anomaly which i've

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,360
never seen before those are my favorites

219
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
i love anomalies all right it goes on it

220
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
says i am growing end game rbx punchline

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
by ethos that is a very

222
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,399
creative long name it says i've come

223
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
across a phenotype that virtually does

224
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,560
not pistol out so it's not making any of

225
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,918
the things that you guys call hairs

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,399
which are the breeding parts of the

227
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,038
female plant it is not making any of

228
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,719
those which is kind of rare it says both

229
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,878
phenos i have through very little

230
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,000
pistols in the stretch phase now at day

231
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,160
50 one house beautiful dense hairless

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
nugs top to bottom and stinks like

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
swedish fish and hubba bubble hubba

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
bubba gum had an orgies so if we took

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
some swedish fish hubba bubba gum and we

236
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,399
had an orgy with them that's what this

237
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
plant would smell like that doesn't

238
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,799
sound too bad in my mind smells kind of

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,879
sweet and juicy i enjoy that smell

240
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,439
he does go on it says the other plant

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,160
has hairless maine colas all the lower

242
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,759
golf balls got pistols late and flower i

243
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
spoke with other people growing this and

244
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
it seems to be common i remember you

245
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
mentioning some wonky things happen

246
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,519
after a few reversals down the line and

247
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,839
i can count at least three or four that

248
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,278
went into these is this a mutation that

249
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,640
comes from reversals i don't know that

250
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,360
it's a mutation

251
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,958
i could just be a trait maybe just a uh

252
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
i don't know necessarily it's a mutation

253
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
because i i i don't have the

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
qualification to identify that that is

255
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,079
uh

256
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,000
a a definition of a mutation it is

257
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
definitely a trait that we're noticing

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,759
and it's a commonality if a lot of

259
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,080
people are getting it um it goes on it

260
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,720
says uh do you think these plants would

261
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,560
be sterile i would assume so

262
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
but i have no way of being certain i'm

263
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,599
gonna keep going as i took three clones

264
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
of the hairless girl and put them

265
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
outdoors i already assume putting them

266
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,039
outside may give them a different

267
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
phenotypical expression you may see a

268
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,439
lot different stuff you may not it says

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
but i figured no pistols no pollination

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
and i would have to worry less about my

271
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
outdoor crop being pollinated by a

272
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,919
careless neighbor or something that is a

273
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,000
really great

274
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,120
idea a really great assumption a really

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,879
great hope

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
but i would take one of those plants and

277
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,679
put it indoors and attempt to pollinate

278
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,799
it just once just to see what happens

279
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,120
being the

280
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,719
highly inquisitive curious person uh

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,879
there wants to know i just want to know

282
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
what if i would take that pistol-less

283
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,838
plant and i would put it in a room with

284
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,199
a male plant and i would just put some

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
pollen on it or i've always got some

286
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
pollen in a fridge or in a freezer i'd

287
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,559
grab some of that pollen and just dust a

288
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,239
couple of plants with that or a couple

289
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,159
of clones of this plant with that and

290
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
see what happened and see if you can

291
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,240
make any seeds out of it then you would

292
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
know that those are sterile or not but

293
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
your assumption is great that plant will

294
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,240
probably not take pollen as well

295
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
probably make fewer seeds that could be

296
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
a really good plant for you the problem

297
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
is how do you get more seeds off of that

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,958
you've got to keep cloning it or make a

299
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,919
bunch of clones is the only way that one

300
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,439
carries

301
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,879
that is the end game

302
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
there's something that we used to hear

303
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,320
about wow this is old cannabis laura i

304
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,278
didn't mean to talk about this how long

305
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
have i been going all right we're going

306
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,639
to get off on a side right here there's

307
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,040
a thing that they talk about back in the

308
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,519
day that is known as the terminator gene

309
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,958
which was bred into plants so i don't i

310
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
don't do this i don't know how to do

311
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,399
this honestly if i read up on it i could

312
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
figure out it's not something i want to

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
do

314
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
um some breeders a breeder somewhere

315
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,799
along the line discovered how to breed

316
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,480
plants and breed what is called the

317
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,319
terminator gene into it if you breed

318
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,560
certain filial generations into each

319
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,240
other you can create sterile plants

320
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,639
basically and i don't know exactly how

321
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
to do it but it's uh i think it's an

322
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,679
octopoid or from what i i've spent so

323
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,759
long since i read it i'm not going to

324
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,838
ramble and get it wrong but there is the

325
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,919
terminator gene where you can breed it

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
to where the plants actually do not make

327
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,039
any more seeds they just stop they are

328
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,039
not fertile plants you'll get males

329
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,879
that'll kick out pollen but the females

330
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,559
do not take any pollen they don't make

331
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,919
pistols they cannot get pollinated

332
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,359
they're sterile they're non-fertile is

333
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,399
the word my brain is searching for as i

334
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,000
ramble so it is possible i'm not making

335
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,919
any assumptions or accusations i am

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
saying it as an option then maybe our

337
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,319
friend has bred in the terminator gene

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,919
by accident here or it just popped up or

339
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
maybe these plants will breed completely

340
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,759
we have no evidence of either direction

341
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,039
but these are all possibilities let me

342
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,240
make sure i got to the bottom of this

343
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,159
message it says i can't wait to pop your

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
wombat femmes in a couple of weeks

345
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,199
thanks for your time much love from our

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,278
friend who calls themselves joe

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,800
jizz you're doing so great till that

348
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,879
part bro no i'm just kidding i love the

349
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,278
creative name uh i think you do have the

350
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,159
great assumption that since these plants

351
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,320
have fewer pistols than most plants that

352
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,480
they won't receive pollen but i would

353
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
hate to find out the wrong way ah that

354
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,360
would definitely be the way to make an

355
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600
ass of you and me so maybe put it

356
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
indoors hit it with some pollen see what

357
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
it does then put it outside sounds like

358
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,560
you've already done it so we're gonna

359
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,159
put it to the true test if any of your

360
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,239
neighbors are out there with some stray

361
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,078
pollen that plant will get it if it

362
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,360
makes seeds then it makes seeds that's

363
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,439
the only way to find out though is to

364
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
pollinate that [ __ ] and to find out

365
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,160
dude thank you for the great message

366
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,838
thank you for letting me talk about the

367
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,078
terminator gene on accident i had

368
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,839
forgotten all about that i will do more

369
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,679
research maybe you guys remind me i'll

370
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
try to do a show that involves more of

371
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,799
the terminator gene all right this next

372
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,360
message does come from patreon big shout

373
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,879
out to the patreon crew once again

374
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,800

00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,600
heart this one comes from our friend

376
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,240
aron and it goes just like this it says

377
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
how about an in-depth conversation about

378
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
getting into the cannabis industry that

379
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,440
is a very good topic that we can talk

380
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,439
about what i'm going to cover is what i

381
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
know i know how to get into the uh

382
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
basically the legal what i'm going to

383
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,399
cover today is getting into the legal

384
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,519
colorado cannabis industry the marijuana

385
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,679
enforcement division regulated legal

386
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,959
cannabis industry the big grows that

387
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,399
produce legal cannabis for the legal

388
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,479
dispensaries that's what i'm going to

389
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,919
focus on today because any other

390
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,039
cannabis business or getting into the

391
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,479
industry

392
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,199
you have to kind of find your niche it

393
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
doesn't i didn't mean to even do this

394
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
when i started this brand this seed

395
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,039
company i think i invented this on my

396
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,239
own on accident i made seeds people

397
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,000
wanted them

398
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
i sold some of them people wanted more

399
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,039
it just kind of snowballed eventually i

400
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
had a seed company i was breeding out of

401
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,399
passion so if you're doing something

402
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,159
you're passionate about that you can

403
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,078
turn into a business

404
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,838
do that if you're doing something that

405
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,159
is ancillary of cannabis that you can

406
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,519
cater to this industry do that but one

407
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,360
thing i'm going to say before i jump

408
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,959
into talking about creating your own

409
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,600
cannabis or what i'm going to focus on

410
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,319
here is the legal side of the industry

411
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
is

412
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,879
don't turn your passion your favorite

413
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,440
thing into a career that could possibly

414
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,559
burn out your passion for whatever that

415
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
subject is um i used to be in the music

416
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,399
industry i'm not i'm not hyping it up

417
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
i'm not bragging this is just a story

418
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,360
here for you i used to play music

419
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,879
professionally i've been around the

420
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
country playing the drums with several

421
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,559
bands i've been on a lot of big stages

422
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
been on even more small stages been in a

423
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,159
lot of tiny [ __ ] clubs playing little

424
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
tiny shows but i've been all over the

425
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,838
place playing music i've been all over

426
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
making money that was my career playing

427
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,440
drums was my job that's what i did five

428
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,198
nights a week that's how i paid the

429
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
bills how i paid the rent how things

430
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,240
worked out for me

431
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
i also worked at guitar center for a

432
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,919
little while i was a department manager

433
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,120
obviously a drum department manager at

434
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,159
guitar center those two things combined

435
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,278
kind of

436
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,679
burnt me out on the desire to be around

437
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,198
and involved in music there was a time

438
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,198
when i would leave my job at guitar

439
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,120
center and most people when you get out

440
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,639
of work you probably walk out to the car

441
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560
you get to the car you sit down and do

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,919
that oh i'm [ __ ] off work thing you

443
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,078
check your phone and you crank up some

444
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,078
music and get on the road right

445
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,679
that wasn't me i would get in the car

446
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:54,799
and hit the pipe as hard as i [ __ ]

447
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,719
could because i wanted to get super

448
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,319
stoned and get all the terrible guitar

449
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
sounds out of my head i don't want to

450
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,519
hear the intro to enter sandman i don't

451
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,198
want to hear [ __ ] back and black

452
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,278
anymore i don't want to hear stairway to

453
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,879
heaven i've been hearing it all day long

454
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,879
and it was just driving me crazy so i'd

455
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,159
get in the car and turn the music off

456
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,399
and try to get as stoned as i could

457
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,719
where i didn't hear music anymore

458
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,559
so it was kind of and then going on tour

459
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
it wasn't fun to be like well we've got

460
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,919
to play this gig but then we can't have

461
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,519
any fun because as soon as we're done we

462
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,120
got to get the gear off the stage and

463
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,799
get in the van and get to the next city

464
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,240
because we don't have we got to play in

465
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,000
12 hours in another city and we don't

466
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,680
even have that much time to drive there

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,799
it would just get hectic maybe not 12

468
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,479
hours but you see what i'm saying it

469
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,799
would burn you out to where playing the

470
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,800
drums was more it became work it wasn't

471
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,399
fun now that i don't have to show up for

472
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,000
a gig and play at a certain time when i

473
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
do get to beat on the drums it is so

474
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,799
joyous it is so much fun my point here

475
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,879
what i'm rambling forever about is don't

476
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,240
turn your cannabis career into what i

477
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,519
did with music

478
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,039
some there was a while when i didn't

479
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,039
want to go to a concert i didn't want to

480
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,399
go see live music because it just felt

481
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,639
like work i was like i'd rather just

482
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,159
miss this show and let myself start to

483
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
miss music again now i'm passionate

484
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,319
about music again but

485
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
don't let this happen to you

486
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
with cannabis don't uproot your whole

487
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
life to move to another state to get a

488

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
you

565
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
visit where you're going i've got a

566
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
friend who is on our patreon who listens

567
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
to the podcast what's up bro i hope

568
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,279
you're well i hope you're safe uh that

569
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
person decided that after listening to

570
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,319
the show and hearing about the industry

571
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,959
they were going to pack up their life

572
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,200
and move to the east side of pueblo

573
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
colorado and get a job in the cannabis

574
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
industry

575
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,519
that only took them about four days to

576
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,678
realize they do not want to be on the

577
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,359
east side of pueblo and they got out of

578
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,960
there as quickly as possible they've

579
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,199
been complaining to me in a friendly way

580
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,759
they've been venting about how not so

581
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,279
great their new location is and if they

582
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,480
would have moved here or visited here

583
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,918
i'm sorry if they would have visited

584
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
here for just a couple of days before

585
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
they moved here and set up shop they

586
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,640
probably would have realized they did

587
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,038
not want to move to where they were

588
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
moving so my advice to you is come visit

589
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,960
or go visit wherever you think you're

590
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,840
going to move if it's broomfield pueblo

591
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,079
denver longmont um what's down south

592
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,918
trinidad any of those places they're all

593
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,399
they all have good and bad things about

594
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,320
them go visit go see if it's for you

595
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,720
some places are for me some places are

596
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,399
simply not for me go see before you

597
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,038
uproot your whole life and move there to

598
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
grow weed first of all do you qualify

599
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,839

600
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,360
requirements to work in the industry

601
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,319
then go see the place you're thinking

602
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,918
about going everybody tells big tales

603
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,439
and fantasies about what they do for

604
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
work when they grow places they want you

605
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,160
to think they're living the dream

606
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
they're not gonna tell you that it

607
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840

616
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,639
heads up before you move

617
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,720
then

618
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
search for jobs before you move when you

619
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
come out here to visit look at the

620
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,519
dispensaries around you look at the

621
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
grows around you

622
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,599
when if you want to be a grower when you

623
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
go to the dispensary ask is there a grow

624
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,079
attached to this facility and are they

625
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
hiring and they'll probably have no idea

626
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,879
they'll tell you how to apply they may

627
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,558
give you an application they may be able

628
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,880
to help you out if you want to work in

629
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,480
the dispensary just ask can i work here

630
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,240
i don't recommend shopping in the

631
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,159
dispensary in the same trip as you get

632
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,240
your application and or drop off your

633
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,720
application i don't want a customer

634
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,279
employee interaction at the same time

635
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,558
it looks to me as a hiring manager it

636
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,798
looks like you just happened to be here

637
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,639
buying weed and thought maybe i'll apply

638
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,319
do them in two separate transactions

639
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,120
just for professionalism that is my

640
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,279
advice when you do go to the interview

641
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,038
don't show up uh in your torn lead

642
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,399
zeppelin t-shirt and your sweatpants and

643
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,720
your dirty shoes

644
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,280
show up looking like you want a job

645
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,440
treat this just like any other job show

646
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,119
up for the job you want if you show up

647
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,640
looking like you don't really work hard

648
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,639
we're gonna think that you don't really

649
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
work hard clean up a little bit i do

650
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
have dreadlocks but i tie them up and

the jobs are going to start you off as

675
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,959
either like a trimmer or a bud tender i

676
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,400
am usually so i used to be a consultant

677
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,840
and a hiring manager i used to do a lot

678
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
of things in the commercial industry and

679
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,439
the commercial grows since covet it got

680
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,679
kind of weird i've taken a step back

681
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,798
from that i made sort of a career change

682
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,400
it's for the better honestly it was

683
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,359
really stressful running commercial

684
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,120
grows

685
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,119
but one of my responsibilities in those

686
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,599
commercial grows was to hire the crew

687
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,038
hire the staff i was the hiring manager

688
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,240
one of my jobs was to make sure that

689
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,000
everybody was going to work well

690
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,359
together make sure that everybody was

691
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,599
going to be able to do their job make

692
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,199
sure that everybody understood their job

693
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,359
one way that i did that was that

694
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,840
everybody that started that grow

695
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,319
if i was hiring you to be the lead

696
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,000
grower or the next consultant my

697
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,158
starting position was that you are going

698
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
to be the trimmer everybody starts off

699
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,679
as a trimmer you have to show me that

700
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
you can show up on time you can follow

701
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,759
instructions you come back from lunch on

702
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,839
time you don't get so high you can't do

703
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,079
your job you can work with the group you

704
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,759
can participate just basic [ __ ] that i

705
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,079
need employees to do before i give them

706
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,919
too much access to the plants they are a

707
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,319
tremor we make them trim a little bit

708
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,320
then we find out who you are once we see

709
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,519
that you can work after a week or two

710
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,839
i'll take you back to the grill and

711
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,240
introduce you to small grow tasks my

712
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,079
point is be prepared to start at the

713
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
bottom you may be and i'm sorry if the

714
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,439
trimmers are offended that i say you're

715
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,960
starting at the bottom that is the entry

716
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
level into the growth i'm not saying

717
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
you're the bottom let me give the

718
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,359
trimmer some love because i feel bad

719
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,439
that i said that tremors i [ __ ] love

720
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,199
you guys without the trim crew there

721
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
would be no product all the [ __ ] that we

722
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,038
grow would sit in a room and get moldy

723
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
and funky if the trim crew didn't trim

724
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,960
it up and take it to the store they are

725
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,798
the go-between between the grow and the

726
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,200
store is the trim crew they are your

727
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,720
quality assurance team so you're

728
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
learning quality control they're

729
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
learning how to trim they're learning

730
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,440
what to expect what goes to the

731
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,320
dispensary the trim crew is a very

732
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,159
important aspect of the operation i feel

733
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,918
bad that i kind of made it feel like you

734
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,840
were not as important as you are because

735
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,880
you are very important but you are the

736
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,639
entry area for my training so big up to

737
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
the trim crew i'm kissing your ass now

738
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,679
feel bad the way i said that trim crew

739
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,200

740
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,320
know you show up once we know you're

741
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,759
going to show up then we'll move you

742
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,519
around the grow to the place that you

743
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,038
wanted to be but you're going to have to

744
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,960
move up i'm not going to let you show up

745
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,319
and water plants on the first day i

746
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,679
don't know who you are i don't know if

747
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,038
you're crazy i don't know if you can

748
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,720
follow instructions i don't know if

749
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,798
you're on drugs man we gotta learn you

750
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,360
and figure you out so be prepared to

751
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,519
start at the bottom and work your way up

752
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,558
your performance will tell me how far

753
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,278
and where you go in my facility i want

754
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,440
everybody to be lead growers because one

755
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,278
day and it does happen i might get sick

756
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
or who knows what could happen to me and

757
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,200
i want there to be people in line to

758
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,960
take over my position

759
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,759
i don't want everybody to be a grow tech

760
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,679
forever i want everybody to be the lead

761
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,440
grower the consultant the head grower

762
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,679
the head [ __ ] in charge that is

763
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,000
the goal so that everybody just keeps to

764
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,840
get moving up as i leave a facility that

765
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,519
lead grower should become the new

766
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,439
whatever director of cultivation and

767
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,960
then everybody should just take steps up

768
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
i think we should all be passing down

769
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,400
that knowledge

770
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,480
so don't be afraid to start at an entry

771
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
level position as a trimmer as a

772
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
training bud tender as in as just

773

777
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,599

779
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,199

780
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,278
anything basic [ __ ] that's all we're

781
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,159
trying to do so be ready to start at the

782
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,640

784
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
new people always get the [ __ ] but

785
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,839
that's how it is in almost any industry

786
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
we exaggerate that in the cannabis

787
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,639
industry

788
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,120
if you do get hired in the commercial

789
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
facility it will not be glamorous work

790
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,759
you're going to get sticky you're going

791
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,360
to get dirty you're going to get

792
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,960
nutrients on you you're going to get

793
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,079
muddy you may have to do some outside

794
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
work you're going to have to take out

795
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,319
the trash you also may have to clean the

796
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,240
bathrooms also i'm going to make a note

797
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,000
i clean the bathrooms also there's just

798
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,839
a chart on the wall every employee gets

799
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,759
a list and then we just go down the list

800
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,278
uh start at the top today i clean it

801
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,798

802
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,720
guy cleans it we just go down the

803
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,759
[ __ ] rotation hopefully there's

804
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
enough people on the list you don't have

805
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,960
to do it very long just cleaning the

806
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,639
bathroom once every couple of weeks it's

807
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720

that kind of stuff but

812
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
you're going to start off at kind of low

813
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,759
pay because unless you get a job like a

814
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,839
lead grower or a consultant or a lead

815
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,558
bud tender or a manager or something

816
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,199
higher up it is going to be low pay and

817
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,918
crappy hours and the terrible part about

818
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,240
it is a lot of the employers don't have

819
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,759
to pay higher because there are plenty

820
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,919
of people that keep coming from other

821
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,519
states to work here to do the jobs

822
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
unfortunately so they're not going to

823
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,000
raise the wages there's not enough

824
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,959
profit to raise the wages unfortunately

825
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,480
that's just how it is in the cannabis

826
