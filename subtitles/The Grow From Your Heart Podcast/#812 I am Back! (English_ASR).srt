43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,359

00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,899
says hello Rasta Jeff hello Mike good to

49
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,699
meet you bro it says I am a grower here

50
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,379
in the Great Lakes State I've been

51
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,598
growing outside for about three years

52
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,479
now in this short season that we have

53
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:18,299
here I bet that's a struggle bro it goes

54
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,219
on it says I'm growing in fabric pots

55
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,099
but the problem is that the pots get

56
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,900
really nasty on the outside from year to

57
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,459
year yes I've seen that like a white

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,280
crusty build up that'll grow on there

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,539
that's from the salt nutrients I'm not

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
sure what you're using to grow but

61
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,299
sometimes they'll get algae on there and

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,159
of course if you're growing outside

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,840
you're going to get dirt and mud and all

64
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,000
kinds of junk and Gunk built up on the

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,620
outsides I completely understand bro

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,060
we're playing with dirt and organic

67
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,219
stuff and nutrients and all kinds of

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,580
[ __ ] here anything could go wrong

69
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,979
anything is possible but it does say is

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,260
there a way to clean these pots year

71
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,199
after year after the growing season ends

72
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,539
or should I buy new pots each and every

73
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,219
year I would like to reuse them each

74
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,079
year if possible that's probably the

75
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,699
most cost effective most eco-friendly

76
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,800
way we don't need to throw away a bunch

77
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,738
of stuff if we can clean it and reuse it

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,000
it goes on it says also that we've got a

79
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,400
second question here let me talk about

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,080
the first question then we will jump up

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,099
to the second question the first one

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,319
here

83
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,060
um I don't know how big your pots are

84
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,098
I'm not sure if you're using I grow

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,140
indoors I use a three a five maybe a

86
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,598
seven gallon pot indoors those aren't

87
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,238
too much to manage you could be using a

88
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,518
30 or even 100 maybe even a 250 gallon

89
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,980
fabric I I'm not sure what you've got

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,719
going on I've got a couple of

91
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:35,878
suggestions that work for me that maybe

92
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,019
you can modify for yourself here's what

93
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,840
I would do

94
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,580
if it were me and they were small pots I

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,500
would take them to the laundry mat and

96
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,239
throw them in the washer throw them in

97
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,759
the big commercial washer if they've got

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,680
it don't unless you're brave don't do

99
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,060
this in your washer at home where your

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,980
lady is going to come home if your wife

101
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,900
or girlfriend or maybe even your mama or

102
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,280
even worse your baby mama is going to

103
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,959
show up and find that you've got a bunch

104
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,598
of pots from the garden in the washing

105
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,580
machine maybe don't do that take them to

106
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,798
the laundromat and wash them in there so

107
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,360
they're not in your your ladies washer

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,980
where she's going to throw a fit and

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,480
then also rinse out run that washing

110
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,158
machine after one time when you're done

111
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,079
at the laundromat to get all your gunk

112
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,120
out of there for the next person but my

113
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,859
first option my first suggestion is take

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,418
them to the laundromat throw them in the

115
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,459
washer give them a good solid Hot Water

116
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,959
Rinse if you want to throw some organic

117
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,759
detergent in there of your choice maybe

118
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,199
do that I don't know that I would put

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,180
any sort of detergent in there just give

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,379
them a good jostle in that washer you

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,120
can even throw them in the dryer when

122
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,759
you're done if you really want to that's

123
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,139
my first idea idea number two throw them

124
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,600
in the back of the truck if they're big

125
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,519
and take them to the car wash go use

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,379
that car wash wash sprayer don't put any

127
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,120
soap in there just pay for the the power

128
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,579
hose I got at the car wash just use that

129
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,780
just spray them down with that uh put

130
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,939
them in the they got the thing you can

131
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,739
hold your car mats the floor mats clip

132
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,240
them into there spray the [ __ ] out of it

133
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,040
let it hang for a few minutes throw that

134
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,199
one on the ground uh maybe bring

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,180
somebody with you and make them carry

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
that one over and [ __ ] shop vac it

137
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,540
out if they can do that for you give you

138
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,759
a little backup maybe even shop back it

139
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,439
out first ah then hang the next one up

140
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,000
spray the [ __ ] out of it let them let

141
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,079
them dry in the sun after that or put

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,459
them in the back of the truck and drive

143
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,199
around they'll probably drive that way

144
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,239
put something heavy on them so you don't

145
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,620
lose any my next idea of course I'm just

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,478
coming up with [ __ ] to help you because

147
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,519
I would use the uh the washing machine

148
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,839
at the laundromat is what I would do or

149
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,299
the car wash

150
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,038
the other idea maybe you got a big farm

151
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,079
maybe you have your own space hit them

152
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,459
with the pressure washer bro uh lay them

153
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,978
out in the driveway lay them out in the

154
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,799
sun or out somewhere and just hit them

155
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:34,319
wow you guys that was lightning uh

156
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,460
thunder so loud I Heard it Through the

157
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,019
headphones through all the noise

158
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,879
canceling I apologize I'm not even gonna

159
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,258
cut that part out of the show I'm in

160
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,839
Southern Colorado we're getting beat

161
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,060
with hail and crazy storms all day that

162
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,038
was wild freaking lightning I apologize

163
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,259
for the shock and distraction uh that's

164
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,360
real life big shout out to the outdoor

165
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,759
growers in Colorado this year you guys

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,800
are working guys and gals are working

167
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,740
for your money let me get back on track

168
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,240
uh power wash your pots if you're out in

169
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,978
the yard if you got a big driveway maybe

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,079
an open space maybe go to a parking lot

171
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,279
I don't know what you can do but get the

172
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,379
power washer out there and just power

173
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,299
wash the [ __ ] out of those pots those

174
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,519
are three solid ideas that I think would

175
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,800
work for you everybody's got a washing

176
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,019
machine or a laundry mat near them most

177
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,180
people have a car wash near them and

178
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,579
some people uh that live near a Harbor

179
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,800
Freight probably have a power washer or

180
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,120
know somebody with a pressure washer and

181
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,500
they love to use those things you're

182
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
friends with pressure washers love to

183
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,339
just [ __ ] blast stuff with them so

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,199
they'll want to do it for you so um my

185
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,119
dude Michigan Mike those are the first

186
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,740
three recommendations for part one of

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,478
your question uh part two of the

188
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,879
question is a really good question that

189
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,459
I get asked a lot of the time so let's

190
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,379
jump into part two it says also are you

191
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,959
ever going to make Auto flower seeds

192
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,259
sometime in the future uh the answer to

193
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,779
that is a strong no I do not make

194
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,879
Autoflower seeds I am not interested

195
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,519
excited nor passionate about passionate

196
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,899
about Autoflower seeds so I feel like I

197
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,758
would not do a good job making

198
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,500
Autoflower seeds

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,620
there are plenty of people out there

200
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,899
making amazing Autoflower genetics that

201
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,399
are readily available I have mentioned

202
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,500
in the past that my friend Daz from

203
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,299
night owl and I were kind of collabing

204
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,839
and working on an Autoflower project

205
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,360
with a half his stuff half mine the F1

206
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,098
generation has been made and no blame no

207
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,598
finger pointing at anybody we both kind

208
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,759
of pushed it to the back burner and have

209
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,319
been working on other [ __ ] uh neither

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,939
one of us have put any energy into that

211
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,460
I'm not blaming anybody we're both busy

212
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:32,219
dudes with uh seed companies and wives

213
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,859
to live but that project it exists but

214
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,660
it has not moved forward in any way I'm

215
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,699
not super involved in the Autoflower

216
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,099
project because like I said it is not my

217
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,620
passion I like Photo period plants

218
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:46,860
eventually Daz and night allergenetics

219
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,598
will put out some irie crosses that have

220
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,819
some Autoflower that are Auto flowers

221
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,918
that have irie in there also my buddy

222
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,060
icon Loco are making autoflowers out of

223
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:55,740
some of my stuff I don't know if they'll

224
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,538
ever release it but

225
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,579
um if you do want the auto stay tuned

226
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,098
and check out Daz from Night Owl because

227
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,439
he eventually one day he will release

228
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,079
autoflowers that do have eye regenetics

229
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,879
in the lineage but not straight up eye

230
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,519
regenetic stuff I'm just not into

231
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,319
autoflowers sometimes I describe it as I

232
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,060
play music I'm a musician I could play

233
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,979
any kind of music you need played if the

234
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,418
band if a band called and said hey bro

235
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,978
our drummer I don't want to give a

236
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,359
drummer a problem but if he disappeared

237
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,918
if he got abducted by aliens because

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
that's rare and cool

239
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,859
um if you got abducted by aliens we'd

240
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,180
talk a lot about you so that's cool so

241
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,979
if you got abducted by aliens and they

242
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,680
said we need a drummer I feel like I

243
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,179
could probably fill in for most basic

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,860
gigs you know what I mean not like some

245
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,778
I probably shouldn't try to fill in for

246
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,120
Dream Theater or Meshuggah or some [ __ ]

247
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,740
but most basic [ __ ] I could do it but I

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,060
don't have a lot of passion to play in a

249
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,519
country band you know that just doesn't

250
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,559
do it for me reggae I gotcha Jamrock I

251
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,419
gotcha rock and roll let's do it country

252
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,579
music I could do it because it needs to

253
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,439
be done but it's not going to be it's

254
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,300
not gonna feel like real country because

255
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,820
I don't have a real country music feel

256
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,620
my autoflowers will just be me playing

257
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,540
country it'd just be really just doing

258
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,919
it for a paycheck and I'm not into that

259
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,599
girl from your heart breed with love

260
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,458

00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,500
mask down underneath her nose she just

279
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,540
wears it over her mouth but she always

280
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,000
gives me a snide look when the names are

281
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:51,299
like Michigan Mike or like Big Mike

284
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,480
problems all right let's keep the

285
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,700
momentum moving here on today's podcast

286
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,500
I've got another great question here in

287
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,379
front of me this one also did come from

288
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,480
the grow help tab on the irie genetics

289
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,338
website this one came from somebody who

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,500
we are going to call Crystal today day

291
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,560
Crystal thank you for the message it

292
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,778
says hello Rasta Jeff hello Crystal it

293
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,939
says I just wanted to say thank you very

294
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,338
much for bringing quality genetics at

295
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,380
affordable prices uh thank you for

296
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,720
noticing um I'm gonna ramble here for a

297
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,580
minute I think that seeds are overpriced

298
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,160
on a lot of websites in a lot of places

299
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,899
by a lot of breeders

300
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,699
um a lot of what was making seeds

301
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,159
expensive back in the day was the idea

302
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,100
of scarcity because the idea of the

303
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,439
legalization the illegalization of seeds

304
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,240
now cannabis is legal in a lot of places

305
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,100
we can produce our product we don't have

306
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,200
to worry about so many things without

307
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,659
all that fear and without the the legal

308
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,339
uh without the justice system involved I

309
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,199
don't think that this product should be

310
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,779
so expensive the price of cannabis has

311
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,680
gone down uh the cost of living has gone

312
00:10:54,778 --> 00:11:00,120
up people don't necessarily need ganja

313
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,859
seeds that's like a secondary and

314
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,379
ancillary product that's like a bonus

315
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,000
you buy food you get all the groceries

316
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,338
you get the baby taken care of you get

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,799
the family taken care of the car or the

318
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,480
phone all that stuff maybe you buy some

319
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,219
some extra good groceries or something

320
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,600
but the the seeds are like at the bottom

321
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,339
of the list of [ __ ] that you've got to

322
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,899
buy so I try to keep them affordable

323
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,880
there's no need to charge a whole bunch

324
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,379
of money for uh seeds that I can make

325
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,179
I've got a lot of them I want to get

326
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,620
them out there I'd rather get the seeds

327
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,719
out there and get them grown and make a

328
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,639
few bucks than have a bunch of seeds in

329
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,379
a box and make a million dollars that

330
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,699
doesn't make any sense to me I told you

331
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,578
I was gonna ramble thank you for

332
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,980
noticing that my seeds are affordable I

333
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,620
want everybody to have access to high

334
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,440
quality seeds that seems very reasonable

335
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,019
and very fair to me I see no reason to

336
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,600
charge exorbitant prices all right let

337
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,000
me move forward it says

338
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,620
um uh being a medical patient it has

339
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,879
really helped me in many ways and I am

340
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,860
very grateful so they're talking about

341
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,200
the affordable seeds uh thank you for

342
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,000
noticing I started off as a medical

343
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,680
marijuana patient myself I started off

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,019
as a pot smoker became a medical

345
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,000
marijuana patient then I became the

346
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,700
manager at the only medical marijuana

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,860
dispensary in my city so I got to see a

348
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,379
lot of people's uh need for cannabis

349
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,639
their medical their recreational need I

350
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,899
sought to improve the quality of

351
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
people's lives so I do have a lot of

352
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,799
appreciation for getting these seeds out

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,019
to medical patients thank you for

354
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,819
noticing once again all right let me get

355
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,519
focused that seems to be a challenge

356
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,680
today why do they call dabs concentrates

357
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,899
when all you cannot do is concentrate

358
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,699
after you smoke I could do anything but

359
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,519
concentrate right now let's get back

360
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,680
into it it says is there any way to know

361
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,259
when certain varieties will be back in

362
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,939
stock on iredirect as I was told by a

363

not small packs it's the normal

411
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,820
packaging you're getting a pack that

412
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,120
most people would pay for on the website

413
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,920
is a patreon contributor for 25 you will

414
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,659
get a coupon code for that free pack of

415
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,059
Jack Tripper seeds of course you got to

416
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,620
pay for the shipping but not only do I

417
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,838
give out that free pack of seeds but

418
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,659
also I will give out coupon codes on

419
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,240
patreon occasionally randomly to people

420
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,919
on patreon it does depend on the tier

421
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
level sometimes it's just just five or

422
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,399
ten percent off sometimes it's free

423
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,320
shipping sometimes you get the first

424
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,000
heads up and the first notice that there

425
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,519
is new stuff coming to the website so

426
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,559
the patreon members can get first dibs

427
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,919
since they do contribute to funding the

428
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,739
website so patreon is your second bet on

429
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,078
getting updates and notifications of new

430
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,659
drops the third option is to come hang
