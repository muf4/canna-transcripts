excited for that I honestly don't know

158
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,610
how excited I am to get back in public I

159
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,959
don't know it's mixed emotions but just

160
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,150
to know I'm allowed to go back outside

161
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,949
and things may get normal again as me

162
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:59,319
feeling excited once I get out there

163
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,759
we'll see how my OCD and my germophobia

164
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,680
really does with being out there in

165
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,389
public again I'm gonna try not to talk

166
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,160
too much about quarantine and kovat

167
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,430
we're just gonna make a time stamp on

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,860
this episode I am recording this on

169
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,319
Friday April 24th we are currently like

170
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,759
several days into a quarantine kovat

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,829
situation so if you're listening to this

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,949
in the future this was actually recorded

173
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:22,810
during the kovat lockdown it's [ __ ]

174
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,240
weird it's just as weird as everybody

175
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,069
said but nothing too crazy has happened

176
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,810
to where I am that's your time stamp

177
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,579
that's your historical moment let's move

178
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,040
forward the first email on today's

179
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,408
episode comes from a longtime listener

180
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,209
I'm not

181
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:37,248
sure if they want their name said but

182
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:39,348
the email honestly i printed the email

183
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:41,088
out and this was the last print from

184
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:42,800
that ink cartridge so there are a few

185
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:44,838
words missing the email is a little

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,778
fuzzy on the paper I can make out what

187
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:50,360
it says it goes something a little bit

188
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:51,769
like this it says hey Rasta Jeff I never

189
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,569
miss an episode of The Grove from your

190
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:56,300
heart podcast and I usually catch the

191
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,979
live feed every Monday night thank you

192
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,169
that means a lot to me every Monday

193
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:03,050
night I do a live Instagram feed I go

194
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:04,668
live 710 mountain time I usually hang

195
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,528
out for about an hour I talk about

196
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:08,838
cannabis and I answer random questions

197
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:10,550
join me if you're available I'm Irene

198
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:13,069
underscore genetics on Instagram check

199
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,019
out the live feed this listener goes on

200
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,968
to say I am a caregiver in Michigan and

201
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,739
you have taught then the next sentence

202
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:20,718
gets cut out I'm gonna hope it says I

203
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,558
have taught you a lot I'm gonna hope it

204
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,998
doesn't say that I've taught you

205
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:25,069
anything terrible and taught you bad

206
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:28,278
habits but it does go on to say I have

207
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:30,619
two quick questions on episode 523 you

208
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:33,259
mentioned rosin wasn't your concentrate

209
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:36,019
of choice why is that I'm an old school

210
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,269
flour smoker but literally then a lot of

211
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:41,240
it gets cut out a full line then I can

212
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:44,300
read concentrate because the majority

213
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,098
were being made using solvents but it's

214
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,689
hard to read that but the next sentence

215
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,728
says solvent free I thought this was the

216
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,899
best route to go I'm new to all this and

217
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:53,538
I thought I would really like to know

218
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,610
the difference now I did read this email

219
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,498
before I printed it I think this

220
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,809
listener does not have a lot of

221
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:01,849
experience with concentrates and they

222
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,769
are considering buying a rosin press

223
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,718
because that is a very affordable and

224
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:07,968
efficient way to make concentrates at

225
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,399
home it is also very safe so they were

226
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:12,978
considering purchasing a rosin presses

227
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,139
what I do believe if I'm correct so

228
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:17,889
they're asking why I have said that

229
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:21,468
rosin is not my favorite concentrate I

230
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,168
do not prefer rosin I like BHO

231
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:26,778
concentrates I like full-spectrum

232
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:29,508
extracts I like batters those are what I

233
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:31,999
prefer that is not made with Roz and I

234
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,490
think the rosin tastes a little bit

235
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,129
funky to me it always has a hint of a

236
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,379
burnt popsicle sort of a flavor I do

237
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:41,808
have one friend who makes quality rosin

238
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,360
but it is quite an extensive process he

239
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:46,399
makes bubble hash out of fresh frozen I

240
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,180
may be inaccurate on some of these

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,159
statements some

242
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,439
these details I believe he is fresh

243
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,629
freezing concentrate making bubble hash

244
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,540
out of that then fresh freezing or

245
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:59,120
freeze drying be concentrate then he is

246
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,500
making pressed rosin from back

247
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,259
concentrate so there are a lot more

248
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,240
steps when you remove the vegetative

249
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:08,028
part the flower part from the press it

250
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,100
makes thing taste he makes things taste

251
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:12,889
much better sorry that was hard for my

252
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,580
face to say the process of squishing raw

253
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,559
flower

254
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,089
it makes the final product taste much

255
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,039
better I don't think you get as much of

256
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,230
that burnt popcorn flavor if you

257
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,879
actually press bubble hash if you make

258
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,889
hash out of it then press the bubble

259
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,509
hash it's a full another step it's a

260
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,419
whole another process that's a lot more

261
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,519
work but it really drastically improves

262
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:33,799
the quality of the concentrate so if

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,500
you're going to make rosin I recommend

264
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:39,289
you follow Pedro's grow room on

265
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,299
Instagram and on YouTube he teaches a

266
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:44,329
lot of great techniques on making

267
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:46,309
high-quality rosin it is not my favorite

268
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,250
unless Pedro makes it I would not buy

269
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:50,239
rosin from anybody but Pedro

270
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,970
hypothetically if you were to make some

271
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,740
available so I am not a huge fan of

272
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,899
rosin that is my personal preference

273
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,539
there are thousands of people out there

274
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,419
who really love rosin it's just not for

275
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:04,338
me I like to smoke pho I like sauce and

276
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,349
diamonds I really prefer the batters

277
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,080
lately something about a nice batter a

278
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,940
greendot batter a good apothecary batter

279
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,770
just a nice dull up in the middle of the

280
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,970
container it's got a nice texture to it

281
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,069
a good flavor and when you hit it

282
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,528
there's something that does in the lungs

283
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,570
it has a nice expansion to feel smooth I

284
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:22,970
can get a big fat hit it tastes real

285
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,850
nice I don't have any hatred toward

286
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,459
rosin it is just not for me I think that

287
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,600
um what's the food that I don't like I

288
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,819
can't even think of a food I don't like

289
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,129
jelly freaking anything I'm a vegetarian

290
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,600
so we'll just say steak isn't there's

291
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,899
nothing wrong with it it's just not for

292
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
me

293
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,100
you guys didn't eat steak do that rosin

294
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
is steak is just not for me I'd prefer

295
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
to have something different so that's my

296
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,578
comparison just personal preference I

297
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:48,588
don't think it tastes good it hits hard

298
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:50,539
and it gets me high it's just not my

299
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,520
favorite thing so that's a long rent on

300
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,639
that then there is a part two of this

301
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,769
question it says another grower podcast

302
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,559
at a quick video a couple of months ago

303
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,139
about pa-ching and said you always need

304
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,799
to put your

305
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,110
pH down or pH up in water to dilute that

306
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,479
solution before adding it to your

307
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,399
nutrient reservoir because if you dump

308
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,839
it straight in with your newts and then

309
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,909
again the sentence gets cut out but I'm

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,450
gonna say there's a risk of a chemical

311
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:20,969
reaction or that acid or base in your pH

312
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,370
balancing solution and possibly disrupt

313
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,120
the nutrients that you just put into

314
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,600
that mix I understand why they could say

315
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,220
that that is a very um that's almost too

316
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,709
much detail to worry about I don't think

317
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,139
that's gonna be a thing most folks are

318
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:39,419
going to be mixing maybe a cap full of

319
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,740
pH up or pH down into their solution

320
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,110
you've got a five-gallon bucket you're

321
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,970
putting very little pH a pH down in

322
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,970
there I don't think it's going to be

323
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,040
enough chemical to cause any problem at

324
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,290
that rate the nutrients you've already

325
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,939
added to that water are elated and

326
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,588
buffered they're protected basically

327
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,690
from that other chemical reaction you're

328
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,060
putting in there I'm not a chemist I'm

329
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,130
not a scientist but I don't think that

330
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,549
those products are powerful enough to

331
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,470
cause any damage in small delusions now

332
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:10,229
in a commercial environment we're

333
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:13,680
putting a hundred milliliters 250 mils

334
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,449
of pH down in a solution at a time that

335
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,578
may need to be diluted that could be a

336
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:19,828
good idea to dilute that with a cup of

337
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,599
water then pour that in when you're

338
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:24,239
going with larger batches that may

339
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,370
really be helpful but for the basic home

340
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,470
grower in a small batch of nutrients

341
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,350
with a small mix I don't think it would

342
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,629
be necessary but if you've got crazy OCD

343
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,190
and you want to be extra detailed that

344
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,379
could be a thing that you could do it

345
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,079
could not hurt but I don't find it to be

346
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:42,120
absolutely necessary for the small grow

347
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,729
environment keep in mind I did preface

348
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,528
that by saying zero chemistry experience

349
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,060
I have zero chemistry knowledge I don't

350
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:50,399
have any papers that say I'm good at

351
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,198
chemistry so I'm not really qualified to

352
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,179
give that answer I'm just telling you

353
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,189
that I've never seen a problem and the

354
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,289
thousands if not millions of [ __ ]

355
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,610
batches of nutrients I've mixed so I

356
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,958
want to thank you for sending a great

357
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,970
email I think we've been chatting a

358
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,198
little bit corresponding through email I

359
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,100
think I've answered a couple of your

360
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,198
questions you may have actually

361
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,120
supported me a little bit so I thank you

362

for all off the love and support I do

363
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,269
know your name I don't know if you want

364
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:13,889
it set on the show but thank you I do

365
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:15,120
appreciate the great message if you have

366
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,490
more questions

367
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,960
please send them my way I will get them

368
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,320
on the show if I don't get them on the

369
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,240
show

370
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,160
I'll answer privately thank you for the

371
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,799
support if anybody else out there has an

372
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,539
e as a question my email address is grow

373
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,459
from your heart at hotmail.com

374
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,709
I would love to get your listener

375
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,930
generated cannabis cultivation or

376
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,970
cannabis culture question here on the

377
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,979
show you guys that cowboy pushes got me

378
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,810
[ __ ] up I'm talkative today let's keep

379
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,039
flowing we've got a couple of great

380
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,179
questions which one are we gonna do

381
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,980
first they're both right here in front

382
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,859
of me this one is gonna work well it

383
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,570
says Rasta Jeff I appreciate all of your

384
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,330
knowledge on the podcast I have a quick

385
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,339
question about carbon filters very good

386
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,620
question you guys how often do you

387
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,330
recommend changing the whole filter I've

388
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,028
changed out the dust filter but I've

389
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,160
noticed a little PM and the humidity is

390
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:04,200
starting to rise a bit I've been using

391
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,899
it for a year they have to be replaced

392
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,520
or just the outer dust filter the smell

393
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,159
has been in check but I'm a little bit

394
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,019
concerned with the PM I just added a fan

395
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,870
in the corner and ordered a new clip on

396
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,629
oscillating fan prior to that I only had

397
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,179
one small clip-on fan maybe I just need

398
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:23,159
more airflow I'm in a 4x4 and the

399
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,769
relative excuse me the relative humidity

400
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,269
has been 50 to 60 percent you're a

401
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,789
little bit high there we need to lower

402
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,009
that humidity the temps are around 72

403
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:35,699
with lights on 60 with the lights off

404
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:37,740
I'm running to Mars ts 1,000 LEDs thank

405
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,480
you Jeff from AJ all right there are a

406
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,000
few things we need to address here in

407
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,190
this question yes you do need to replace

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,379
that carbon filter I think the

409
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,930
manufacturer recommends every two years

410
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,458
I don't know how much air you're running

411
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,199
through there I don't know what size

412
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,669
blower you purchased I don't know what

413
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,770
size carbon filter you've got I don't

414
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,679
know how big the room is I don't know

415
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:01,379
other environmental factors to put into

416
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,259
my brain equation here I don't know how

417
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:06,208
much stank and dust and dirt and pollen

418
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,830
and powdery mildew and humidity have

419
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,899
gone through that filter most

420
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,910
manufacturers say 18 to 28

421
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,169
I think it's 26 what's the [ __ ] in 18 to

422
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,389
30 months I'm trying to do math in my

423
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:15,708
head

424
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,120
they say one and a half to two and a

425
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,939
half years they recommend about a two

426
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,259
year change you're saying that so it is

427
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,000
time to change it probably because

428
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,439
you've got a lot of other factors you've

429
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,019
had powdery mildew in there

430
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,180
the humidity is raising the humidity

431
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,700
will lessen the effectiveness and

432
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,919
lifelong the longevity of your filter

433
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,079
you've also had powdery mildew I would

434
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,309
consider swapping out that filter just

435
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,870
because of the powdery mildew I know

436
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,399
it's going into there and then going out

437
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,169
but I don't know powdery mildew that

438
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,809
makes me paranoid I wouldn't want to get

439
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:46,278
that again so it is probably time or

440
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:48,139
close to time to changing out that

441
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,240
filter if it's in the budget it is

442
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,458
something I would consider now you said

443
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
that you had powdery mildew also you

444
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,099
asked about the the outer filter if that

445
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,649
thing is dirty

446
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,480
give it one clean with oxy clean rinse

447
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,919
it out one time put it back the next

448
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,930
time it gets dirty that is generally

449
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,969
when I say that it's time to replace the

450
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,379
filter if it's getting that much dust in

451
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,509
it it's showing you that it's getting

452
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:10,129
really dirty on the inside it's probably

453
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,019
gonna stop taking out the smell real

454
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,000
well you say it doesn't stink

455
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,709
that's your grow you also don't think

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,940
your armpits stink when your girlfriend

457
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,009
leans on you and goes god you need a

458
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,019
[ __ ] shower we don't notice some

459
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:23,059
smells we get noseblind to certain

460
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,860
things bring somebody new into the house

461
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:26,869
and see if they notice that grow that's

462
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,730
how you know if the filter works bring

463
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,259
the landlord over see if they notice

464
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,269
that's how you know if the carbon filter

465
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,278
works now we're talking we've talked

466
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:35,690
about changing out the filter that dust

467
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,309
cover needs to be clean needs to be

468
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,699
replaced needs to be put it back on run

469
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,649
it again

470
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:41,240
check for smell if you're confident but

471
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,919
there's no smell you may be okay I'm

472
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,329
concerned with the powdery mildew in

473
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,469
there that may be alright I don't think

474
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,899
you're gonna blow it back out it just

475
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,579
makes me worried keep beings clean it

476
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,740
shouldn't smell if you smell it swap it

477
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:53,719
out now what has me concerned you said

478
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,698
that the humidity is high and what you

479
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,670
have done to fix the powdery mildew is

480
00:16:55,698 --> 00:17:00,889
to add a fan a fan is a good start but

481
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:02,689
that is not going to lower the humidity

482
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,519
we need a way to remove the humidity

483
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,350
from the room and that can be done

484
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,818
through an exhaust fan by sucking the

485
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,740
air up through the top of the tent or

486
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,558
that can be done by placing a

487
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,449
dehumidifier in the actual tent but I

488
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,699
don't think that a fan is going to solve

489
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,150
the powdery mildew problem it will slow

490
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,009
it down

491
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,750
and will make it longer it will make it

492
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:23,150
take longer to appear but I don't think

493
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,130
it's going to be the solution so find a

494
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,079
way to lower that humidity 50 to 60

495
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,190
percent when you get into flour is going

496
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,839
to be ridiculous

497
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,820
and you're also going to have more

498
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,289
vegetation in the room at that time

499
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,460
you'll have big buds you'll have more

500
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,079
leaves you'll be watering more

501
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,480
frequently you're going to have more

502
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,119
opportunity and more reason for powdery

503
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,529
mildew to pop up I recommend some way to

504
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,419
get that humidity out of there

505
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,670
I also recommend maybe a harder

506
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,529
defoliation and that should do it for

507
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,810
you d foliate take some leaves out of

508
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:53,450
there and then just learn how to lessen

509
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,700
the humidity overall in the room exhaust

510
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,799
at the top dehumidifier something like

511
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,750
that is going to be required so you do

512
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,149
need to replace that filter I would say

513
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,980
about a year 18 months in I don't go

514
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,350
over two years of course I grow super

515
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,750
stinky weed I've got just the right size

516
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:11,469
filter the appropriate size blower so

517
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,460
that lasts about 18 18 months two years

518
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,920
you're gonna want to reduce your

519
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,140
humidity or that powdery mildew will

520
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,970
keep coming back it sounds like we got

521
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,520
you figured out bro you've got that clip

522
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,769
on fan and another fan and maybe time to

523
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,720
add an exhaust fan to the top of the

524
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,579
grow tent I want to thank my friend AJ

525
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,839
for the great grow question you guys I'm

526
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:31,609
gonna take a quick drink of some water

527
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,619
here I'm not gonna press pause please

528
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,789
bear with me you folks on the video if

529
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,679
the video ever comes out you get to

530
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,349
watch me take a sip so here we go take

531

532
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,949
motherfuckas

533
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,520
well I needed that more than I realized

534
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,070
that was pretty damn refreshing drink

535
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,529
some water you guys all right I've got

536
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,720
another messenger in front of me let me

537
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:03,298
get my [ __ ] together this one goes a lot

538
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,120
like this it starts off with hey Geoff

539
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,319
firstly sorry for the loss of your uncle

540
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,269
hey thank you I appreciate the

541
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,609
condolences I appreciate the support

542
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:13,650
I miss my uncle thank you for the love

543
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,599
it goes on to say I just wanted to share

544
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,509
some pictures of my lemon Geoffrey and

545
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,668
ask you a co2 question I did look at the

546
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,679
pictures and your plants look great you

547
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,809
guys out there in podcast land imagine

548
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,340
some beautiful lemon Geoffrey plants

549
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:28,500
they're [ __ ] perfect now we'll keep

550
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,089
going it says I'm absolutely loving the

551
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,000
podcast I think you're doing a fantastic

552
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:35,819
job educating your listeners and helping

553
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,200
us focus on things to help us all become

554
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,319
better growers during these difficult

555
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,330
times that's awesome - thank you

556
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:45,058
now it says first question is about co2

557
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:47,759
during the vegetative state is there any

558
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:50,460
benefit to running co2 during veg yes

559
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,410
running co2 during veg will make your

560
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,150
plants grow more quickly you'll get more

561
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,340
rapid growth you'll get better use of

562
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,200
your nutrients you're feeding the plants

563
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:00,000
high-quality nutrients hopefully we've

564
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,590
got them under high-quality lighting if

565
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,619
you can afford it and the room is

566
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:06,808
designed properly yes co2 will

567
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,819
absolutely increase the performance of

568
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:10,950
your plants right now general

569
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:14,970
atmospheric conditions are approximately

570
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,620
400 ppm of co2 particles per million of

571
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,829
co2 depending on where you are that

572
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:22,558
could be more or less about 50 ppm or 50

573
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:24,029
ppm is less based on your location your

574
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,190
altitude will have something to do with

575
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:29,548
that but generally we're sitting about

576
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,440
400 particles per million of co2 in the

577
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:34,319
general atmosphere our plants can eat

578
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,200
much greater volumes of co2 than that

579
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,609
they'll get a much higher performance

580
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,500
environment going on you'll see it if

581
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,909
you do it they'll notice so I'm gonna

582
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,460
keep going cuz I'm rambling I wanna get

583
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,679
myself back on track it says my second

584
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,200
question is how much and for how long do

585
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,540
I run co2 this is my first attempt at

586
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,429
running co2 I've started on day one a

587
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,899
flower okay I would have done it in bed

588
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,160
but you started in a flower you're

589
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,759
putting him into turbo charge that's

590
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,940
cool

591
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,539
my setup consists of a five by four tent

592
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,460
with a high output for evergreen indoor

593
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,710
uniformity Pro LED uh not familiar with

594
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,840
that light sounds fancy if it's working

595
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,910
for you that's awesome I know what size

596
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,579
tent that is it says I'm running two

597
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,529
five-gallon drain science air pots with

598
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:19,659
Pro mix and nectar of the Gods this is

599
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,420
all making sense so far I've got an

600
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,430
autopilot co2 meter and controller I had

601
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,009
said it 1,200 ppm that is gonna work

602
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,320
well for you that will work my tent runs

603
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,839
around 80 to 85 degrees with RH around

604
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,599
60 you might want to reduce that RH just

605
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,579
a little bit during lights on AC

606
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,589
Infinity fans handle the exhaust I have

607
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:41,139
two oscillating fans and two stationary

608
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,149
fans in the tent should I run the co2

609
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,580
until harvest or is this a waste and is

610
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,170
1202 much too little or just right

611
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,899
alright there are a couple of things to

612
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:52,000
talk about in that uh you were doing it

613
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,430
correctly I would reduce the overall

614
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,500
humidity and I think if you've got the

615
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,140
LEDs eighty to eighty-five maybe cool

616
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,750
the oscillating fans and stationary fans

617
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,759
are cool uh should I run it till harvest

618
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,319
yes I would run it right up until the

619
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,710
day of harvest you are not wasting it at

620
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:10,779
that point 1200 is good 14 is good 16 is

621
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,490
when you're kind of pushing it 1600

622
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,799
PPM's is that's when you're kind of

623
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,710
maybe wasting it 14 you're like oh yeah

624
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,329
1200 is great um there's something that

625
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,340
got my attention though where is it

626
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,679
there's a wine and exhaust fan let me

627
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:27,429
read back my tail AC infiniti fans

628
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,769
handle the exhaust my question is are

629
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,450
you exhausting out your co2 are you

630
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,519
wasting your co2 with that exhaust

631
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,100
process you've got a very small

632
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,230
environment it's not going to take a lot

633
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:41,109
of air movement to exhaust out all of

634
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,400
the co2 you were generating so is the

635
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,279
co2 in the tent

636
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,370
are you exhausting that tent into a room

637
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,529
how big is that room how much co2 is

638
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:54,308
happening in that room are we able to

639
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:57,190
cycle that co2 back into the tent

640
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:59,979
if you have got co2 happening and you

641
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,369
can minimize the humidity I may reduce

642
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:05,769
the exhaust fans and not run them or run

643
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:07,658
them very minimally because you don't

644
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,858
want to keep sucking out that co2 it's

645
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:10,570
expensive you don't want to keep going

646
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:14,019
and buying tanks or whatever you're

647
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:16,148
doing to generate the co2 I would think

648
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,308
of cost-effective ways to set this up I

649
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:20,048
don't know what your full environment is

650
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:21,999
I don't know where the tent is located

651
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,858
but are you wasting co2 by pumping it

652
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,778
right out of the tent every time your

653
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:27,548
exhaust fan comes on hopefully it's

654
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,378
going into a bedroom and office the

655
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:31,628
spare room whatever and hopefully it's

656
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:33,038
just drawing that right back in maybe it

657
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:34,449
mixes with the atmosphere and the rest

658
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,429
of the room and it can come back in you

659
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,319
get a little fresh air with it I'm not

660
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:40,719
sure but if you're pumping co2 you can

661
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,759
turn off the exhaust fans as long as the

662
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:45,070
heat and humidity don't get too high so

663
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,108
that's a juggle a balancing act you're

664
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:48,009
gonna have to dial in there but it

665
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:50,499
sounds like you're doing things

666
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:52,450
correctly you've got the meter the

667
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:55,088
controller it sounds like you're doing

668
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,619
it right now as long as the co2 goes off

669
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:59,499
when the lights go off I think

670
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:00,939
everything will be cool but my advice is

671
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,798
to make sure you were running that

672
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,450
correctly but you're not sucking it all

673
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,179
out with your exhaust because that will

674
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,679
get very expensive it says feel free to

675
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,899
share my pictures if you choose to use

676
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,849
the question on the show I can also feel

677
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:14,949
free to use my name alright big shout

678
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:16,538
out to my friend Sauer D bro you're

679
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,499
killing it with that lemon Jeffrey I

680
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:23,769
hope I answered your co2 question 1200

681
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:25,569
is good 14 is high 16 is [ __ ] really

682
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,249
high 18 is when people go what are you

683
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:29,769
doing bro so you're right in the right

684
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,819
ballpark you were doing it correctly do

685
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,829
it while the lights are on

686
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:35,769
turn the co2 off when the lights go off

687
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:37,928
and I do recommend using it at the

688
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:41,019
vegetative stage I generally start co2

689
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:42,820
kind of low 6 or 800 ppm s in bed and

690
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:44,769
then about every week I increase a

691
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:46,778
little bit until we're into that beefy

692
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,058
bloom stage and then you'll notice the

693
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,769
performance increase and take notes

694
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:52,569
write down how much you're paying for

695
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,700
the co2 and how often you buy it and

696
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:55,928
then see how much performance increase

697
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,088
you get at the end you get a better

698
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,249
harvest you get more yield was it worth

699
00:24:58,088 --> 00:25:02,019
it do it two or three times and find out

700
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,239
if it's worth that extra trip to the

701
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:06,579
store the extra equipment the extra

702
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:07,690
effort see the extra money see if it's

703
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,460
actually worth it

704
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,230
all right sour D I want to thank you for
