20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,140
I like to start the podcast off by

21
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,448
talking about what I'm dabbing this

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,850
evening I've been taking dad's of cowboy

23
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,128
Kush full-spectrum extract from our

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,280
friends at Green Dot labs this is a

25
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,929
blend of H a o G and star dog on the

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,750
package the flavor is described as

27
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,489
earthy fuel and leather I'm going to

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,200
agree with the earthy the fuel is

29
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,599
certainly there there may be some

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,640
leather one thing I am noticing if I

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,000
smell this jar and I pull it away from

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
my face quickly I do get a hint of

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,200
strawberries or watermelons and I

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,540
believe that is coming from the star dog

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,700
if you let the star dog flower for just

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,040
a little bit too long it will produce a

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,530
little bit of a berry flavor I really

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,110
think that this product represents that

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,989
strawberry watermelon sort of flavor and

40
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,299
aroma I really enjoy it of course I like

41
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,609
the buzz the most impressive part about

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,799
this package it is a four gram container

43
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,319
when I cracked open the jar it is just

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,780
one giant diamond in the middle of the

45
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,029
jar with just enough Terp sauce around

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,009
it to make it delicious I was really

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,469
impressed with the appearance of this

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,509
product of course I love the aroma and

49
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,938
I'm sure you can tell by how chatty I am

50
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,569
that I completely love the buzz of the

51
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,798
cowboy Kush full spectrum extract all

52
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,989

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,929

54
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,150

55
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,030

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,539
work our way into this grow lesson I

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,060
teased it enough we're going to talk

103
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:01,189
about Reve edging our cannabis plants

104
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,530
before we get into the actual process

105
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,280
let's talk about why we might want to

106
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,259
revenge

107
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,780
a cannabis plant I teased about it

108
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,429
earlier sometimes you may grow a plant

109
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,650
from seed you may grow a plant from

110
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,840
clone and you may realize this is

111
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,239
amazing cannabis this is the plant I've

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,668
been searching for my entire life not

113
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,439
all plants are the same not all growers

114
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,629
are the same not all grow environments

115
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,509
are the same to find the perfect plant

116
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:28,009
for the grower for the room is sometimes

117
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,599
a real it's in a

118
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,490
accomplishment you feel really excited

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,220
like I've got the [ __ ] plant for me

120
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,060
this is the one that does what I need

121
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,890
recreationally maybe this is the one

122
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,720
that is doing what I need financially it

123
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,399
probably grows perfectly for you it

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,710
smokes beautifully for you it tastes

125
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,120
perfectly it cures your ailments or it's

126
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:46,399
stacking up your wallet real well

127
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,379
however you're working with it sometimes

128
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,149
you find that perfect plant but then you

129
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,129
realize I didn't take a clone of this

130
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:54,019
plant then you are heartbroken

131
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,730
sometimes you take a clone of it and the

132
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,009
clones don't root sometimes the clones

133
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,660
die sometimes [ __ ] happens maybe your

134
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,310
helper kills the clones maybe your cat

135
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,560
kills the clones I don't know what

136
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,660
happens but sometimes we grow the most

137
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,699
beautiful plant we've ever seen and we

138
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,439
don't have a clone but we really are

139
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,550
kicking ourselves in the ass wishing

140
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,680
that we've done some sort of

141
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,750
preservation so we can grow that plant

142
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,930
again and that is where Reve edging

143
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,930
comes into play Reve edging happens at

144
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,990
the end of the flowering phase I like to

145
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,959
start Reeve edging around the same time

146
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,850
that I begin flushing a finished crop so

147
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,609
you grow your plants they're almost done

148
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,160
it is almost time to harvest then the

149
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,620
last 10 to 14 days of the flowering

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
phase we should be flushing our plants

151
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,100
we should just be feeding them clean

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,860
water these plants are getting ready for

153
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,520
the harvest phase this is when I like to

154
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,379
begin the re veg process now I do

155
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,689
understand that what I am about to say

156
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,399
is kind of new and unique to some people

157
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,350
and it may freak you out a little bit so

158
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,779
if you don't want to start your revenge

159
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,660
process when you begin the flush phase

160
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,639
that is okay you can start your revenge

161
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,650
process after you have harvested the

162
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,209
rest of the room just save that plant

163
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:07,159
that you need and most of my

164
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,439
instructions will be basically the same

165
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,689
we will catch up when we get to that

166
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,180
part now we're going to focus on the

167
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,310
revenge phase happening during the flush

168
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,040
phase or the last two weeks of the

169
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,050
flowering cycle the thing that is going

170
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,720
to tell our plants that we want it to

171
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,090
revenge is the light schedule we made

172
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,790
these plants flower by reducing the

173
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,009
light to 12 12 we gave that plant a long

174
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,470
enough dark period to make the plant

175
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,149
think that it is the fall season and it

176
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,680
should go into flower because the end of

177
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,259
its life is near these plants are

178
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,090
accustomed to living for one full cycle

179
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,839
they get one cycle out of life and then

180
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,729
they die

181
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,039
an annual plant they don't come back

182
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,780
they make seeds and those seeds are what

183
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,310
carries on the generation the plants

184
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:51,829
don't plan on living more than one

185
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,959
season so if we can trigger our plants

186
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:56,418
into going into the flowering phase by

187
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,149
manipulating the light cycle we can also

188
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:01,609
trigger these plants to go back into the

189
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,789
vegetative stage by manipulating the

190
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,970
light cycle the opposite direction so

191
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,580
about 10 to 14 days before I plan to

192
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:15,280
harvest my room I will put my light

193
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:18,168
cycle back on an 18 and 6 light schedule

194
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,939
now I know that may sound alarming to a

195
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:22,459
lot of new growers that may sound

196
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,800
alarming to a lot of experienced growers

197
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,529
we want these plants to flower we want

198
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,240
them to keep going we want beautiful

199
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,949
fatties sticky buds with nice trichomes

200
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,379
all over them that is our main goal for

201
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,269
this garden and now I am telling you to

202
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,250
flip your light cycle back to a veg

203
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,680
cycle while you're almost done flowering

204
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,100
I know it sounds crazy I know it sounds

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,090
scary

206
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,570
let me explain myself we are 10 to 14

207
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,859
days away from cutting down these plants

208
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,579
remember that when we flip the plants

209
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,150
into flower

210
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:55,579
it took them approximately 12 to 15 days

211
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,549
before they started flowering these

212
00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:00,409
plants are going to take 10 to 14 days

213
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,240
before they start showing you any

214
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,000
difference that they are trying to go

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,038
back into a vegetative state and before

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,860
these plants get to that we're going to

217
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,110
cut them down this increased light

218
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,509
period is also going to make the buds

219
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,449
get thicker and fatter and beefier and

220
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:20,029
chunkier you will actually potentially

221
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,250
increase your harvest weight this may

222
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,739
also potentially speed up your harvest

223
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,620
time by a day or three so pay attention

224
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,689
to the trichomes also pay attention to

225
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,848
the plants if you see them starting to

226
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,440
do any weird things at the tips it'll be

227
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:35,360
right at the tips of the buds the very

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,250
tops of the buds will start to look like

229
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,050
they're getting new growth the minute

230
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,639
you see that it is time to harvest they

231
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,549
are starting to go into a vegetative

232
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,799
state and revenge most plants will not

233
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,458
show you a rebadged growth until about

234
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,949
day 17 maybe day 21 so I think my 10 to

235
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:54,349
14 day recommendation of increasing the

236
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,700
hours of light will put you in a safe

237
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,040
timeframe if

238
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,530
you harvest in that 10 to 14 day window

239
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,139
again this is plant specific this is

240
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,689
environment specific so pay attention to

241
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:06,919
your plants if you know the plants you

242
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,440
are growing and you're familiar with

243
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,389
them feel comfortable with that 14 days

244
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,970
if they are new plants and you're not

245
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,639
sure what to expect maybe only go for 10

246
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,680
days but I truly do not think you will

247
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,980
have a problem with any sort of revenge

248
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,159
before harvest if you start this 10 to

249
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,320
14 days before you plan to cut down so

250
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,819
step number one is to increase the

251
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,120
lights if you can increase the lights

252
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,629
from 12 12 or 11 13 if you can put them

253
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,970
back on in 18 6 or perhaps a 19 and 5

254
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,649
light cycle the more light the merrier

255
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,370
at this point that's what I would

256
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,039
recommend

257
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,830
do not go 24 hours of light at this time

258
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,529
I don't find that to be necessary if you

259
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,930
do want to run a 24-hour schedule after

260
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,149
you harvest that is effective but let's

261
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:55,699
not do it yet until we chop down the

262
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,669
usable part of the plant so now we have

263
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,190
got our plants on an 18-6 perhaps a 19-5

264
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:02,809
cycle you will notice that the plants

265
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,430
that are closest to the light that are

266
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,529
getting the most light will begin to

267
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:08,269
revenge the earliest so if you've got

268
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,279
one specific plant which you want to

269
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,750
revenge maybe get that plant in the

270
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,850
middle give it the prime real estate

271
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,559
where it is getting the best optimal

272
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,560
light and that will help speed up your

273
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,049
process now for the next 10 to 14 days

274
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,519
we are on that extended light cycle we

275
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,349
are going to continue to flush the

276
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,029
plants now we need to pay attention to

277
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,550
the trichomes we also need to watch for

278
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,689
that Revenge growth but things should go

279
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,189
just as planned

280
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,380
just like they normally would if we

281
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,570
hadn't changed that light cycle you may

282
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,799
get to harvest one to three days early

283
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,840
not a big deal

284
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,669
pay attention to the trichomes now we

285
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,180
are going to harvest just like normal

286
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:47,240
except I would recommend to leave some

287
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:49,339
of the very bottom small buds if you've

288
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,379
got four or five buds on that plant that

289
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,790
are the size of your thumb I've got big

290
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,679
thumbs if they're the size of my thumb

291
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,149
or your thumb that is fine leave

292
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,859
yourself somewhere between three and

293
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,990
five little buds on the bottom of that

294
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,000
plant cut the rest of it off leave those

295
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,340
buds there so that you've just got some

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,720
sticks with four or five little buds on

297
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,340
it and that is going to be your new

298
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,690
plant that you are going to focus on

299
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,330
reef edging

300
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,790
plant has already been under an extended

301
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,759
white cycle so it is already beginning

302
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:19,549
to adjust to that light cycle it knows

303
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,799
inside that we want it to begin Reeve

304
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:24,259
edging it already is trying to do that

305
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,549
now we have removed all those giant buds

306
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,069
we've just got a little bit of that

307
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:30,379
plant left it is much easier for that

308
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,629
plant to revert that little tiny batch

309
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,250
of hormones to fix that little tiny part

310
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,009
of that plant instead of trying to

311
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,750
revert that entire plant back to veg so

312
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,730
now we've just got a couple little buds

313
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,200
four or five little buds and they're

314
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,539
going to start Reeve edging they're

315
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,030
going to slowly go back to the veg phase

316
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,889
I mentioned earlier that at this point

317
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,350
if you've got a room where you can do it

318
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,330
you can put this plant under 24/7

319
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,129
lighting you want 24 hours a day

320
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,530
lighting for this plant if you've got

321
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:01,189
that space if you don't have that space

322
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:03,559
put it under an 18-6 or a 19-5 veg

323
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,320
schedule and this plant will slowly

324
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,869
begin to grow new growth it will start

325
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,480
to make kind of funky kind of twisted

326
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,060
kind of weird leaves that is what is

327
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,970
expected from a plant that is revenge

328
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,859
you just took a plant and basically put

329
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,379
it through puberty and made that plant

330
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,120
go from a pubescent teenager all the way

331
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,950
to an adult all the way to the point

332
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,139
where it thought it should die and now

333
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,360
you were returning it back to that

334
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,460
prepubescent stage of its life it is

335
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,950
going to make some weird shaped leaves

336
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,080
for a little while it'll look like dill

337
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,930
it'll look like mint it'll make some

338
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,230
really weird leaves don't freak out be

339
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:44,179
patient that is to be expected

340
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,580
eventually those leaves will grow out

341
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,979
and make shoots they begin to look like

342
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,690
normal cannabis leaves they will look

343
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,940
just like the leaves that drew on that

344
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,130
plant the first time you grew it the

345
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,839
amount of time it is going to take for

346
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,960
this plant to start revenge

347
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,720
depends on several factors the first

348
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,730
factor is genetics where is this plant

349
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,830
from what part of the planet that this

350
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,899
plant originated from how much light

351
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,639
does it expect to get how much light is

352
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,829
it used to getting and then how much

353
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,169
light are you giving it light is

354
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,970
probably the second determining factor

355
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,919
when it comes to a reef edge if you've

356
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,379
got good genetics and you've got enough

357
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,338
light it may revenge much more quickly

358
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,578
than

359
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,920
genetics under weak lights also before I

360
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:31,308
mentioned turning that light cycle to an

361
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,588
18-6 or a 19-5 while we are in flower if

362
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:35,929
you did that you are going to be two

363
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,670
weeks ahead of the game as opposed to if

364
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,308
you did not change your light cycle

365
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:42,498
until you harvest it both methods will

366
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:44,480
work the second method where we don't

367
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:46,550
change the light until after harvest is

368
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,249
obviously going to put us two weeks

369
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:51,558
behind the revenge game so pay attention

370
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,939
to those leaves that's where we were pay

371
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:54,409
attention to the leaves are gonna start

372
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:55,998
growing dill looking leaves are gonna

373
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,490
start growing really weird

374
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,319
curly twisty leaves that is okay the

375
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,110
plant is going to freak out for a little

376
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:04,818
while be patient with the plant while

377
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,949
the plant is freaking out there are a

378
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:08,899
few things we can do to make it more

379
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:12,198
comfortable and also speed up this

380
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:14,778
process one thing to consider is that

381
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,328
this plant has spent its entire life in

382
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:20,448
the container which it is potted in it

383
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:22,849
may be useful to repot this plant into a

384
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:24,919
larger container if this plant was in a

385
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,470
three gallon maybe consider putting it

386
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:30,318
in a five if it was in a five maybe go

387
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,379
for a seven maybe go for a ten if you

388
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:35,899
chose the appropriate size pot for that

389
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,600
plant on its first run it should be

390
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:41,659
greatly rootbound inside that container

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,939
by now those roots should fill all of

392
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,399
that space plants that are root bound

393
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:47,659
want to go into flower they are in panic

394
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
mode they're going hey my shoes are too

395
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,588
tight I got to do something and they

396
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,230
start freaking out it will be more

397
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:56,240
challenging to revenge a plant which is

398
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,089
root bound so a good idea something that

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,428
may help you out would be to up pot that

400
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,470
plant into a larger pot and when you

401
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:05,958
take that pot it's real easy don't be

402
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,449
scared lay the plant on its side shimmy

403
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,979
that pot right off of it then take that

404
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,990
root ball and kind of break it up with

405
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,819
your fingers a little bit and then have

406
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,068
that next container of soil filled about

407
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,958
halfway set your plant right in there

408
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,698
and then just top fill the rest of the

409
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,799
soil on it and then give it a good water

410
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:24,498
your plant will be happy with you for

411
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,139
giving it new shoes bigger tires a fresh

412
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:28,579
home just be careful not to break any of

413
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,558
the branches you've only got a couple of

414
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,909
small buds left on there it should be a

415
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:33,750
fairly easy process

416
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:35,969
so one useful tip is

417
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,740
two up pot your plant into a larger

418
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,019
container that way it is not root bound

419
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,970
that way it knows hey this guy wants me

420
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,009
to grow more it's expecting a little

421
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,290
more for me then hopefully it will give

422
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,659
it to you another way to get more from

423
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:52,110
this plant is to begin feeding it a

424
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,909
solid vegetative nutrient mix let's go

425
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,360
back to veg newts we don't want it to

426
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,730
flower

427
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,159
we need nitrogen let's start giving it

428
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,139
vegetative newts and don't forget that

429
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,929
just because you've got a small plant

430
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,549
you still have a large root zone water

431
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,919
that container like you've got a large

432
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:10,319
root zone it will take a few days for it

433
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,879
to dry but it will be okay keep in mind

434
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,040
that you've got more roots in there then

435
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,689
you've got plant up top think about that

436
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,129
as you were watering don't go drowning

437
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,020
the plant because I said that and then

438
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:21,570
blame it on me but keep in mind there's

439
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,429
more below the ground than what you see

440
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,379
and that part up top is just a very

441
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,419
small representation of the root ball

442
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,429
hopefully you saw that root zone when

443
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,349
you repot it you know exactly how much

444
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:33,120
you need the water so now we've got our

445
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,980
plants on an extended light cycle

446
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,620
they're either on eighteen six nineteen

447
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,089
five or twenty four and zero another

448
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,039
thing to keep in mind is the appropriate

449
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,170
spectrum at this time we want to use a

450
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,000
vegetative light maybe you've got a

451
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,099
metal halide light maybe you're using a

452
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,220
ceramic metal halide maybe you're using

453
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,110
an LED it would be ideal to use the

454
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,089
appropriate spectrum more of a blue

455
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,980
light and less of a red light something

456
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,020
geared aimed more at vegetative growth

457
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,730
we were trying to get the plant to go

458
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,710
back into veg so let's give it the

459
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,389
appropriate spectrum guys I'm gonna hit

460
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,019
pause and take a drink I don't let me

461
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,879
lose my place

462
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,439
alright that was quick I'm sure you can

463
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,569
hear my voice mess it up I did not want

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,100
that to continue here we go we've got

465
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:13,049
our extended light cycle we have up

466
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,359
potted our plants now they are on the

467
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,698
way to trying to revenge we are feeding

468
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,859
them vegetative nutrients we want to

469
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,750
give them strong veg newts maybe give

470
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,240
them some type of a kelp product that

471
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,578
will encourage them to revenge and speed

472
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,380
up for you so the plants will continue

473
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,119
to grow they will continue to come out

474
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,890
of that weird growth you'll start like I

475
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,079
said before you'll start seeing weird

476
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,240
leaves come out of your buds just weird

477
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,309
looking oddly shaped leaves they may be

478
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,549
twisty they may be curly they may not go

479
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,220
the right direction let that plant grow

480
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,809
over time it will begin to produce

481
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,120
normal-looking shoots it'll just have

482
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,849
little shoots grow

483
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,849
right out in the bud those shoots will

484
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:55,308
begin to produce normal-looking leaves

485
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,529
it will kind of look like you just cut a

486
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,660
clone and put a clone right inside one

487
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,369
of your buds and a clone grew out of

488
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,590
your bud and it will begin to make

489
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:05,719
perfect leaves just like the original

490
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:08,058
plant did and like I mentioned before I

491
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,009
don't know exactly when to expect this

492
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:12,440
because this is going to be strain

493
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,509
dependant environment dependent feed

494
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,058
dependent and also it's going to depend

495
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,859
on when you started changing that white

496
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:21,109
schedule so pay attention

497
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,699
once it starts making good looking

498
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,609
clones come out of the top of the buds

499
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,860
that is when it is time to clone that

500
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:30,019
plant take that part that looks like a

501
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,539
clone coming out of your bud and simply

502
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,400
clone it snip it off of there and clone

503
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,500
it just like you would any other clone

504
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,390
if you're going into an easy cloner do

505
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,160
it just like you would cut it put a

506
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,960
little snip in the middle dip it in the

507
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,910
cloning gel put it in the easy cloner

508
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,220
and let it rock for four to seven days

509
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,779
you'll start seeing roots if you're

510
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,789
going to put your clone in a rapid

511
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:51,259
Rooter or a root riot or maybe a rock

512
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,899
wool cube whatever you prefer

513
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,789
take your clone cut that nice 45 degree

514
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,050
angle on there scrape the clone up a

515
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:59,119
little bit to take off that outer

516
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,669
surface dip it right in your cloning

517
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,509
solution put it in your rapid Rooter put

518
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,400
it in the dome

519
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,140
make sure your rooters are treated and

520
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
soaked properly and don't touch it for

521
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,059
four or five days open it up and check

522
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,670
on it and over time whichever method you

523
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:16,279
choose you will have a beautiful new

524
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,800
clone now what I recommend is that you

525
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,289
take that clone and pot it and treat it

526
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,599
as a mother plant let that plant grow up

527
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:27,440
and start producing branches and arms

528
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:30,379
and shoots then use those branches and

529
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,840
arms and shoots as your new clones for

530
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,000
your next crop so let me kind of repeat

531
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,639
that you are going to clone the chute

532
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,130
that grows out of the bud that is going

533
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,070
to become your new mother plant once

534
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,250
that plant creates branches take clones

535
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:48,230
off of that plant and grow those those

536
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,509
branches and those shoots are ready to

537
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,308
rock you won't see any stress from them

538
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,160
they won't even remember that they were

539
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:58,309
revenged those plants that you cut

540
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,620
should act just like that original mom

541
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,109
plant that you fell in love with that we

542
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,329
forgot to take clones from so I feel

543
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,139
like I have covered a quick lesson on

544
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,149
rivetting

545
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,130
I'm going to recap really quickly just

546
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,620
to make sure I didn't leave anything out

547
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,690
it all starts before harvest at the

548
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:17,509
flush time change your lights back to

549
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,460
eighteen six if you can if not that is

550
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,710
understandable we will wait until after

551
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,210
harvest and we will deal with that then

552
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,009
we were going to harvest we were going

553
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,110
to leave somewhere between three and

554
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:28,879
five little buds at the bottom of the

555
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,289
plant just with the few leaves sticking

556
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
off of them so that we've got

557
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,149
opportunity for fresh growth so we have

558
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,429
fixed our lights we have harvested we've

559
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,559
left a few small buds now let's change

560
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,700
the light cycle back to eighteen six or

561
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,730
twenty-four seven

562
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,429
whichever works best for you then up pot

563
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,710
bat plant if you've got the opportunity

564
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,960
the pot the soil and the space I really

565
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,079
recommend that then we've got to feed

566
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,850
these plants a vegetative mix then over

567
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,428
time you'll see that new growths start

568
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,439
coming out pay attention to bat don't

569
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,330
cut off any of that funky [ __ ] just let

570
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,429
it grow the hormones are moving around

571
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,659
the plants doing what it needs to do let

572
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,280
that weird [ __ ] grow

573
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,620
it'll stop happening then eventually

574
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,339
you'll see beautiful new growth coming

575
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,589
out of it

576
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,359
once you see that new growth it looks

577
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:17,539
normal it looks like the old familiar

578
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,909
plant take a few clones use those clones

579
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,440
as future clone donors we also call

580
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,600
those mother plants but grow those

581
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,269
plants up and take clones off of those

582
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,178
and use those clones as your next crop

583
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,069
so yes you do have to revenge the plant

584
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,050
then you have to clone it then you have

585
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,000
to clone that clone and those clones

586
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,069
will be reliable I feel like those

587
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,619
plants will be back to normal you won't

588
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:41,539
see any stress or any issues and like I

589
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:44,000
said before they will not even remember

590
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:46,970
that the plant they came from had ever

591
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,670
been flowered so that is my quick lesson

592
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,769
on revenge that is my quick recap I hope

593
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,870
you guys followed along I hope I made it

594
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,690
