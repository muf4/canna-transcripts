124
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,680
Fox here I know you mostly as Fox I'll

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,660
probably call you foxy most of the show

126
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,180
that's for a month you are who I refer

127
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,970
to as my CBD expert if I've got a CBD

128
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,139
question I usually call you up so Wow

129
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,180
I guess what I should start with this

130
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,099
can you tell my listeners a little bit

131
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,900
about what CBD is okay

132
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:50,240
CBD just like THC is a compound

133
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:53,449
cannabinoid in cannabis that is non

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
psychoactive so let's say tea is a

135
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:59,769
psychoactive compound which obviously

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,410
gives us a great feeling CBD is a

137
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:06,649
non-psychoactive cannabinoid that has

138
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:10,010
different qualities that THC doesn't

139
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:13,310
have okay yes and I mean it's it's one

140
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,259
of 138 found in cannabis and it's like

141
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,990
you know we're [ __ ] 138 couldn't have

142
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:22,759
annoyed 113 oh wow I only know of maybe

143
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:32,569
12 or 13 yeah II was sitting down with

144
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:33,920
me and I was just like so THC is the one

145
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,050
that we all love it gets us high because

146
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,930
it displaced you said there is no

147
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,850
psychoactive effects to CBD no there's

148
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,829
more like a euphoric effect right you

149
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,439
know in high doses you can get kind of

150
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,300
like an elevated euphoria but it's

151
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,469
nothing like a psychoactive effect where

152
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,090
you feel high percent right I've smoked

153
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,650
a lot of CBD being in Colorado we're

154
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,839
blessed to have absolutely Biddy

155
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,549
available I'm not I don't smoke a lot of

156
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,439
CBD myself it doesn't do anything for me

157
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,000
I am a medical marijuana patient but I

158
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,649
don't need the CBD so I try to save it

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,680
for the patients trip we did talk about

160
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,329
it on one episode I will talk a little

161
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,250
bit later about the effect that had on

162
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,439
myself

163
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,209
yeah but I want to hear more about so

164
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,189
why are we going for the CBD it what

165
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,989
does it really do for you why are you so

166
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:21,800
enthusiastic about CBD if it's not

167
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,910
psychoactive okay well my story with CBD

168
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,670
is a little bit it's long we've got

169
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,360
plenty of time okay so in the long terms

170
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,389
of it when I was

171
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,150
young you know I'd lost a child to

172
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,860
epilepsy and so your own child

173
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,929
yeah I'm sorry but I never knew that no

174
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,280
yeah it's fired brother um that's that's

175
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,030
why I'm here and that's why raise

176
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,549
awareness

177
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:47,149
I lost my second child epilepsy I was

178
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:52,360
very young what happened I had no idea

179
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:54,888
about epilepsy at the time literally it

180
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,780
took me by storm there was a good

181
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,468
seven-year period where I had one - a

182
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:03,228
very confused place it puts strain on

183
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:05,598
every relationship around me all that I

184
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:07,848
continued to focus on at the time was

185
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,209
cannabis and I had no idea that it would

186
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:13,519
bring me round circle - something that I

187
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:15,649
dealt with and not really knew about

188
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,508
what had gone on until I met a parent

189
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,609
going through something similar with

190
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,740
their nonverbal autistic child who was a

191
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,389
cannabis patient in their state they

192
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,079
started telling me all about the wonders

193
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,908
of how CBD is working for them but they

194
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,438
have problems getting at problems

195
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:32,089
obtaining at the CBD that they were

196
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,560
getting was tainted and making their

197
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:39,859
child sick had random [ __ ] in it

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,750
absolutely terrible yes we didn't know

199
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,908

wonderful unit that he had I think a

272
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,829
sweet leaf or something I think so and

273
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,120
then okay Caleb over there I got the oil

274
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,860

275
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,470
award-winning chocolate bar that it was

289
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,809

290
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:56,509
the the entry okay

291
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:59,219
the banana cream that was so delicious

292
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,379
walked around just slow for the rest of

293
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,360
the day it put a little slowness on my

294
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,289
day you know the oil that we used for it

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,490
it came back testing out at 71.3% CBD

296
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:14,009
okay ten point nine five percent THC so

297
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,600
really strong seven to one so when we

298
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,909
cranked out and did the math that he

299
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,810
dosed it out it came out to like 160

300
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:24,379
milligrams to that bar and I mean it was

301
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:27,209
almost the perfect ratio for just

302
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,179
literally having the calmest day we come

303
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,009
we gave some and donated stem to some

304
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,039
autistic patients that were having some

305
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,450
rage issues pediatric nonverbal so

306
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,458
obviously you know it's hard to gate

307
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,690
stuff like that and the results that we

308
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,250
were getting back from the parents were

309
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,930
almost immediate saying just from a few

310
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,850
chips of this chocolate bar they were

311
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,829
getting calming soothing effects and it

312
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,409
was really helping with those oh I could

313
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,980
see there's no way that I could be

314
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:54,208
rageful or angry after eating that thing

315
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,580

316

319
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,838

320
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:08,070
rage what other things to CBD help with

321

cancer we all know that THC kills cancer

325
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,050
cells CBD freezes the cancer cell in its

326
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,990
tracks so it can't progress or grow any

327
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:27,838
further but it will not kill it so anti

328
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,440
cancer is freezing it at bay it's best

329
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,050
it basically causes cell death in the

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,170
mutated cells and so that the tumors

331
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:39,029
can't grow anymore but there they still

332
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:41,429
exist if they're okay if you use a

333
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,399
conjunction of a high CBD heights

334
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:47,279
tht regimen with cancer you're bound to

335
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,470
basically stop kick fries and kill those

336
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,329
mutated cells and you know get back to a

337
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,830
healthier you know way of living yes so

338
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,780
CBDs in your protection so obviously

339
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,970
it's very popular with epilepsy and

340
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,069
other neurological diseases Asperger's

341
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,560
autism children on the spectrum

342
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:09,510
Crohn's PTSD anxiety it kind of goes on

343
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,169
it's almost anything that an adult would

344
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:15,899
be suffering from pretty much for my

345
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:18,929
headaches I don't even take any form of

346
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,490
aspirin or any I mean I have completely

347
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:23,819
separated all that with different

348
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,500
regimens of CBD and THC in just a

349
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,629
healthy cannabis regimen you know okay

350
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,059
Vina endocannabinoid system is very

351
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,980
important and we all as medical patients

352
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,889
have our own deficiencies in those

353
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,440
systems CBD is one of those all-around

354
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:39,600
protectants it's it's the vault it's the

355
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,700
multivitamin of the cannabis you know

356
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,980
world I like that you make a sticker out

357
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:49,259
of that yeah Centrum sticker it does so

358
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,450
much and in different variations and

359
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:57,169
ratios it can help so many different

360
00:13:51,450 --> 00:14:01,170
things I mean Parkinson's cerebral palsy

361
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:04,439
nerve damage it goes it goes on and on I

362
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:07,969
mean it literally the in CBD itself

363
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,760
there's other spectrum of cannabinoids

364
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:16,519
cbn CBG cbc you know that all have

365
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:19,259
different medical attributes that aren't

366
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,750
psychoactive gets run hot kind of things

367
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,860
these are one of these is an

368
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,389
anti-inflammatory one of these is a

369
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,610
antibacterial one of these is a bone

370
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,919
regenerate you know I make a CBG cream

371
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,690
for a couple of patients that have this

372
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,269
rare disease called keen box disease

373
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:40,110
which is where your wrist is basically

374
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:43,529
dying and I came up with a salve that

375
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,330
literally supplies immediate relief for

376
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,959
people that have had the surgery have

377
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,850
that pain

378
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm trying to make that more readily

379
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,529
available that's amazing that's amazing

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,029
that should definitely sway some of the

381
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,470
people I encourage people that don't

382
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,509
know a lot about cannabis to listen to

383
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,100
my show so that should sway them to

384
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,470
believe a little bit more in medical

385
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,670
marijuana and the uses as practical uses

386
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,710
and then we're not just in this just to

387
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:07,829
get as high as we possibly can yeah I

388
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,860
mean a lot of us are yeah take fat dabs

389
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:15,330
and get rekt but there's medicinal value

390
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,720
in actively use CBD and part of my

391
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,700
regimen all the time I don't just

392
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,200
advocate it or you know do what we do

393
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,759
with the genetics and you know the

394
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,890
breeding and just everything in general

395
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,809
I need you know I literally I know I'm

396
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,830
happier with it I'm calmer I'm a much

397
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,759
more productive person I don't have

398
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,410
going through some of the things that

399
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,059
you know I've gone through at a young

400
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,649
age you know that kind of you know it

401
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,409
weighs on you a little bit you know and

402
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,649
so it it gets hard sometimes literally

403
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:49,409
as soon as I started enriching my

404
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:52,980
cannabis diet with CBD I've noticed a

405
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:56,789
wide spectrum of problems that I was

406
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,190
having day to day really kind of just

407
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:01,409
have more control over I don't really I

408
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,120
don't let it get to me anymore and I

409
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:07,559
just find myself being incredibly more

410
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,100
productive I feel the same way about THC

411
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,779
yeah exactly see and I'm glad that we

412
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,519
can sit here and talk about that because

413
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,069
like yourself you're obviously a

414
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:27,659
wonderful advocate for THC one of my

415
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:37,260
friends team Landon thank you guys on

416
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:39,509
Facebook yeah he cured his leukemia with

417
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,710
THC strong cannabis though he started

418
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,019
with the realm of caring which is

419
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:46,200
obviously known for Charlotte's Web and

420
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,210
the yeah but the CBD oil which he

421
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,129
actually wasn't even using for the most

422
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,960
part I mean they used it as a supplement

423
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,629
because they noticed it was stopping

424
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,850
what the chemo is doing but they made it

425
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,970
very they were very adamant the TV is

426
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,089
what killed

427
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,889
his leukemia and you know shoot it's

428
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:05,318
been I think over six months since he's

429
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,298
had a clean you know ability yeah

430
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,688
absolutely no four state chemo anymore

431
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:11,828
state for scheme oh I'm sorry no more

432
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,009
all the tests have come back completely

433
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:17,349
negative you know there's no signs he

434
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,879
still maintains a healthy regimen Sierra

435
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,658
maintains as his caregiver and we

436
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,250
oversee you know all that and I've seen

437
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,720
what both sides of it does so at the end

438
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,189
of the day though we advocate for our

439
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,048
different compounds are different

440
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,950
cannabinoids whole plant cannabis is

441
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:36,099
what I think is the full spectrum yes

442
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,580
the synergistic effect yeah so shout out

443
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:41,889
to team Landon that's good play this

444

Judy I want to be here doing well yeah

447
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,119
it did Colorado Springs is so neat we

448
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,369
were talking a minute ago about how the

449
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,079
medical community here has United

450
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,329
because we don't have recreational so we

451
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:06,399
don't have the there's not as greedy of

452
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:07,480
a vibe in cannabis here it's beautiful

453
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,650
they're a bunch of people just hanging

454
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,940
out in line just waiting to get a DAB

455
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,288
and it's all peaceful no one's got a

456
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,548
problem we got people up there whipping

457
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,470
up dabs for them they're pressing up

458
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:16,298
rosin and everyone's just hanging out

459
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,470
it's so peaceful it's great I love it

460
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,548
you guys come on down to the candy cane

461
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:23,740
and get a dab with this one of these

462
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:24,940
nights so earlier you told me we talked

463
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,839
a little bit before we hit record you

464
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,759
guys we hung out and got comfortable

465
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,709
took a bunch of dabs together but you're

466
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:34,569
telling me that you made extracts before

467
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:38,288
you even grew yes just being a process

468
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:41,859
you process I hate saying I mean I gonna

469
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:44,558
devalue is what you're doing but where

470
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:48,759
we were whatever the case was it started

471
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,440
one way and it started becoming clear

472
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:53,408
that we couldn't control you can only

473
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,450
control so much of what she make because

474
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,890
it's all in your starting material

475
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,710
absolutely and I wanted to start

476
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,320
controlling the type of medicine that I

477
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,779
was making instead of just processing

478
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,849
other people's material I mean because

479
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,230
it's hit or miss you have some people

480
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:10,329
that put their love and their everything

481
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,240
into their material and it shows when

482
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:16,389
you end up pulling it out and sometimes

483
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,849
not the case flora my and everything

484
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,840
else into the oil absolutely exactly

485
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:27,099
what you mean that's the most

486
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:30,189
wonderfully nice way yeah so you know

487
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:32,469
start processing the oil found out that

488
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,298
I kind of really love doing it it got

489
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,179
back to you know my roots in chemistry

490
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,259
and just little things like that and and

491
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,330
seeing what people are doing with

492
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,129
distillation even a few years ago and

493
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:44,048
and things like that yeah I'm seeing how

494
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,260
we're coming along I mean we're still a

495
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:49,389
budding baby

496
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:52,359
industry in the can of chemistry world

497
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,460
oh yeah I agree with that yeah it's

498
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,398
amazing to see what we're doing now with

499
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,470
technology that's been around for a long

500
00:19:57,398 --> 00:20:01,148
time and now we have these wonderful new

501
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,980
ways and freedoms to apply these new

502
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:04,839
applications so it's great to see what

503
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,339
these guys are doing and people are

504
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,959
coming out with new extraction

505
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,519
techniques whether it's in the solvent

506
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,730
list world or whether we're using you

507
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:16,990
know solvents or whatever the case is

508
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,069
and it's exciting to see you know what

509
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,509
are some of the things you make I've

510
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:22,298
seen you make a bunch of different types

511
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:25,029
of CPL products let us do the list of

512
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:27,099
what you can do so we've made

513
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,220
suppositories for some patients we've

514
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:32,408
made dogs CBD biscuits we've also made

515
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,409
one-to-one treats for the cancer you

516
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:37,270
know some older you know some of our old

517
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:40,030
canine friends have you know fatty

518
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:42,099
tumors or whatnot dog absolutely you

519
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:43,808
know so we do what we can and started

520
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:46,119
coming up with solutions solutions to

521
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:48,668
try to help those patients yeah yeah

522
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,909
those those people you know those two

523
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:53,300
that we love

524
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:57,440
you know I have a few myself so from

525
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:59,899
there SABS bombs different ratios of

526
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,990
capsules for a wide variety of ailments

527
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,860
from you know everyday

528
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:11,720
cannabis regimens you know for a normal

529
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:14,209
medical patient to an extended hospice

530
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,589
patient where what we do at that point

531
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,650
is make them as comfortable as we can

532
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:20,059
and we're you know these patients are in

533
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,710
the excess of taking anywhere from a

534
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,049
thousand to three thousand milligrams of

535
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,759
cannabis a day to make them comfortable

536
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,909
you know because that's what you can do

537
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,890
so and you're able to produce then

538
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,040
reliably for the people absolute let's

539
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:37,360
come in that we do we make per patient

540
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:40,460
it's specifically per so there's nothing

541
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,529
- the sad that I've talked about the CBG

542
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,299
salve and then any collaborations that

543
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,789
we've done with friends like Caleb or

544
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,169
anything like that are things that are

545
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,119
even close to being mass-produced

546
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:53,090
everything is small-batch everything is

547
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,250
individually made per patient very we've

548
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,899
done saline and cannabis saline

549
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,740
infusions as well as for those children

550
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:04,100
that have DeFede through G tubes oh wow

551
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,680
we've done - thinking of everything yeah

552
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:09,199
we've done some medicated lubricants as

553
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,870
well we've done those work yeah

554
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,600
absolutely

555
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:20,209
shoot obviously different concentrates

556
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:26,509
water extracted butane extracted what's

557
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,980
the white CBD stuff I've seen yeah I my

558
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,650
friend's team Landon have a company

559
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,180
called Landon south Hut and they work

560
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:37,009
with the lab here in the states that

561
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:40,190
produces this hemp derived 99.5 seven

562
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,420
percent I CBD isolate Wow and at first

563
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,039
she started telling me about it and I

564
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,840
was very skeptical and I wanted more

565
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,220
information and then we got in touch

566
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,230
with the lab and I found out that they

567
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,880
were using you know American sourced

568
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,170
hampt and they you know they kind of

569
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,300
walked us through the process of you

570
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,940
know do dis elating and then you know

571
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:58,190
crystallizing

572
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,509
you basically you know it's I know just

573
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,278
made it sound like it's a simplified

574
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:02,480
process but it kind of is you know it's

575
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:04,490
just a matter of getting the right

576
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,490
material we said you're gonna you've got

577
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:13,609
a chem background so absolutely I skim

578
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,620
the pond with the rocks of time but what

579
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:18,408
catches really catches and through a lot

580
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:19,548
of trial and error you you learn that's

581
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,140
what this industry is all about

582
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:23,148
absolutely trial and error is your

583
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,610
friend and I mean that's how I do

584
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:27,048
everything and I really you know we try

585
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:30,740
to focus and don't get anything out

586
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:32,210
until it's right and we in the series of

587
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,859
things I can really only think of one

588
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,259
little thing that we've ever gone

589
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:38,028
through and you know you're making

590
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:39,890
edibles for someone I learned my

591
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,240
mistakes and putting flaxseed in there

592
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,120
because some people are very susceptible

593
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,640
to that allergy but other than that like

594
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,528
I can't think of you know what we make

595
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,220
has really helped a lot of people across

596
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:53,690
the board for all the different ailments

597
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,548
we stay away from alcohol extractions as

598
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:00,200
far as our so any alcohol infused

599
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:02,139
tensions or anything like that just

600
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,940
because we mostly started with pediatric

601
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,159
epileptic patients the trace amounts of

602
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,990
alcohol could the medications that they

603
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,330
have to take for the most part even

604
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:14,778
trace amounts of that kid effect and

605
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:16,939
totally just give them a huge variety of

606
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:19,369
complications with their medication and

607
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,269
I've seen it you know it's also it's

608
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:24,678
very hard on their digestive systems and

609
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:26,778
so yeah children that are going through

610
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,519
chemo children that have autism children

611
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:30,880
that have epilepsy all have compromised

612
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,609
immune systems and compromised digestive

613
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,110
systems in their own way so one of the

614
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:38,599
problems that I've seen with pediatric

615
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:41,168
patients using our so is that they have

616
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,058
problems holding down that medicine so

617
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:47,538
start going around and promoting you

618
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:50,509
know different carrier oils different

619
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:53,019
you know ways of taking this you know

620
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:55,308
non solvent or solvent extract and

621
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:57,079
decarboxylate and you know putting it

622
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:59,269
into a healthier carrier oil for these

623
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,359
children what's an example maybe co-op a

624
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:02,879
bottle coke

625
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,229
oil in kind if someone is diabetic and

626
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,450
they want to try a healthier route

627
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,269
there's always ham seed oil which is the

628
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,220
healthiest I mean it's protein juice

629
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:13,740
it's it's absolutely wonderful for you

630
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,920
so I always say hemp seed oil first if

631
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,630
not avvocato Isle grape seed oil is

632
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,880
another wonderful example of something

633
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,290
you can use those in coconut oil but you

634
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,030
know a lot of people are very happy with

635
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:26,279
coconut oil if it works and you know it

636
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,539
works a lot of people are on the coconut

637
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,819
oil cake it seems to be real popular

638
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,139
definitely my first questions with that

639
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,689
is if they're Crohn's patient or

640
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,610
diabetic I asked them right away and you

641
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,259
know we just I transparency is

642
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:38,369
everything you know true knowledge

643
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,349
you know this knowledge is all open

644
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,449
source so the more you can be open with

645
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:43,829
the patient and explain it to them the

646
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,480
more they leave knowing at the end of

647
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:47,759
the day the better it is in the long run

648
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,679
you know have you thought about going to

649
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,240
dispensaries and maybe to medical shops

650
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,160
and teaching the bud tenders this sort

651
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,048
of stuff or do you think they Dave I

652
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,410
absolutely think there's a really

653
00:25:55,048 --> 00:26:01,129
important part and people bartenders

654
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:04,830
specifically getting some form of

655
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,600
Education because a lot of them I'll be

656
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,058
very blunt I say this a lot of them look

657
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,189
at is just a job you know a lot of them

658
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:12,690
come in looking at is the retail job

659
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,250
there's a lot of retail aspects to what

660
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,529
it is because it is a peel a

661
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,970
point-of-sale system but the other day

662
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,470
you're dealing with medical patients and

663
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:24,390
what you're providing what you're

664
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,160
helping sell is we want to be taken

665
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,840
seriously like a medical industry like

666
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,548
we're trying to actually take the time

667
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,379
with the medical patient like is

668
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:33,150
required I don't think anyone ever got

669
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,130
too mad at a bun tender for knowing too

670
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,519
much like proper information about their

671
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,440
meds

672
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,970
I've been a budtender and I've annoyed a

673
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,269
few people with my weed nerd skills

674
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,710
people just don't care but you you tend

675
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,389
to feel them out and people that are

676
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,679
just there for what they want are there

677
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,330
for just what they want but there's

678
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,840
curious patients that come in and they

679
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:53,879
have genuine like like real questions

680
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,159
about things that they don't know Joe's

681
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,690
wonderful to have somebody there that

682
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,548
knows that they're talking yeah I can

683
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,980
just make them feel more welcome and

684
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:02,839
more often than not you build

685
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,910
wonderful business relationships with

686
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,250
your patients and they feel comfortable

687
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,259
coming back and getting you know their

688
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,169
medicine from people that actually know

689
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,579
and care about what they're eat at the

690
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,080
restaurant where the guy remembers me

691
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:16,939
and remembered oh you like this last

692
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,349
time you just want to go back when you

693
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,380
build a relationship and aren't treated

694
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:24,048
like customer number seven for today

695
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,030
yeah yeah so you said you don't make a

696
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:30,589
Rick Simpson oil type of product now you

697
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:33,740
have an alternative I do I literally

698
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:37,099
will infuse I mean the oils that we make

699
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,099
in comparison are either infused with

700
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:45,668
hemp seed oil the Tincher percent okay

701
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:50,359
or we crank the ratios out with raw

702
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:52,160
vegan egg hemp seed or grapeseed oil or

703
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,168
coconut oil and we'll use that as the

704
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,950
carrier and we've seen I can get the

705
00:27:54,169 --> 00:28:00,820
dosage almost down to similar to what it

706
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,220
would be and your body's gonna love that

707
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:07,189
black tar that black sludge is super

708
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,079
hard for about oh yeah you get nauseous

709
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,150
and change colors some people still eat

710
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,279
that stuff wrong I don't understand how

711
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,840
they can do it it's you know so we're

712
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,819
just trying to find better ways of

713
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,269
easier ways for this to get into our

714
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:21,649
system and healthier ways Rick Simpson

715
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,539
was an innovator for what he did but

716
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:27,200
right now knowing what we know about

717
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:29,539
NASA and the process and I mean you were

718
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,360
we're at a different place now medically

719
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:34,519
so we know better and we should provide

720
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:38,959
that to our page right like your

721
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:41,150
integrity on that know we kind of got

722
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,009
sidetracked we're talking about you you

723
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,048
started making hash before you started

724
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:46,700
growing yep so how did you end up

725
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:48,319
because you weren't satisfied with the

726
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,870
material that was around right pretty

727
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:58,639
much okay in Cali and the bay was kind

728
00:28:50,869 --> 00:29:00,319
of people are on that cookies trip a lot

729
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,710
of the CBD fire that was coming out was

730
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,450
looking like grass clippings or it was

731
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,190
really bad I'm not sure plants are hard

732
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,380
to grow no the CBD heavy plants are not

733
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,650
as easy to grow as some of the more THC

734
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,150
or sativa or indica

735
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,309
as a breeder in a grower I recognize

736
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,320
that heavily I don't like ced dominant

737
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:20,779
plants so here's the thing as a grower

738
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,689
that started out just girl you see we D

739
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:25,279
dominant plans the first time I pop some

740
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,600
seeds that would cheesy dumb and I was

741
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:31,730
like this is really easy oh yeah alright

742
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,399
you'd have the curve now and yeah I took

743
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,680
off the training wheels the curves that

744
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,840
I had to deal with for CBD for growing

745
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,039
the CBD or not what I was dealing with

746
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,720
it growing you know some very wonderful

747
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,960
TC genetics that I had been gifted and I

748
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,058
was just like oh my god

749
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,058
[Music]

750
00:29:54,170 --> 00:30:00,650
your ratios will be affected severely if

751
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:03,079
there's any sort of stress during the

752
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:07,009
vegetative state whatsoever because that

753
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:09,049
CBD is already there in the vegetative

754
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,549
state before before it's been flipped or

755
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:12,919
anything you so glad you said that

756
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,720
people often completely overlook their

757
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,880
veg state people will build a growl I've

758
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,440
watched people build $10,000 flower

759
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,940
rooms and spend six or eight hundred

760
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,500
bucks just fixing up a shitty old

761
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,690
bedroom to make a bed space I'm like

762
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,250
come on let's do that cuz that's like

763
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,870
you said that's where the plants start

764
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,970
starting stage of life you're growing

765
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:31,939
from seed you obviously want to wax your

766
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,440
tapper you want to make you strong

767
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,259
adolescence before you put them in habit

768
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,890
really yeah I learned that with CBD

769
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:41,509
plants the very hard way and every time

770
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,860

787
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,529

788
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:23,179
is see me has been completely open

789
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,190
source with me and helpful and any

790
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,870
little thing that I it's literally

791
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,630
fast-tracked me so much that it's a

792
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:30,859
blessing you know it's I am completely

793
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,590
grateful for the knowledge that's been

794
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:35,689
dropped on me because it took me from

795
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:39,349
trying to provide for my patients and

796
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,450
struggling to knowing things that I just

797
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:44,000
would have never grasped before you know

798
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:48,049
like I said it's I'm truly grateful for

799
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,429
it but yeah I started as an extractor it

800
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,619
just took one of my friends getting

801
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:53,450
screwed over basically for me to say you

802
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,849
know what dude I'll grow for you yeah

803
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,410
there you go yeah

804
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,909
became very public about it and when I

805
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,070
first started growing my problem was

806
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,450
people hoard these or they were hoarding

807
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:04,129
these strange right

808
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,049
so it was like well let's share them

809
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,150
let's you know let's pull cut and you

810
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,009
know give them out and I you can only

811
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,600
help as many people as you can get this

812
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:14,779
cut out to you which is something I'll

813
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:18,469
touch into later but my main source was

814
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:21,019
you know okay well let's make this

815
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,910
happen so my time in Cali people were on

816
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,819
this crazy cookies craze I was going

817
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,220
from noir cow to SoCal and brilliant

818
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,928
Southern California no hits at all no

819
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,970
progress whatsoever in Northern

820
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:34,160
California so I fell in love with a

821
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,980
wonderful plant called sour tsunami and

822
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,308
I met an amazing group of breeders in

823
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,150
the Emerald triangle that changed my

824
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:43,819
life

825
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,410
some they were already caregivers for

826
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:49,460
some of the children in the state going

827
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:52,040
through cancer these men showed me what

828
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,289
real compassion was at the very starting

829
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,808
point when I was in this industry and

830
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:58,460
blessed me with some genetics and

831
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,109
knowledge and play me in the right

832
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,870
directions of things for what I wanted

833
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:06,849
to do a shout out a crew name or

834
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:09,909
something Ringo you know you know

835
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:12,548
the spirit lives on yeah man there's a

836
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,230
there's a lot of them you know they know

837
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:18,400
if they hear this they know they are

838
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,990
their kind hearted people who don't do

839
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,880
this for the name they just used for the

840
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:24,039
sake of continuing to push cannabis

841
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,160
forward you know for Jacob but they've

842
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,379
got my respect absolutely all right so

843
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,850
these people in NorCal you find this

844
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,190
crew in NorCal and you fall in love with

845
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:35,980
them you find Sauer tsunami yep you

846
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:39,250
start growing nowan yeah started asking

847
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,980
questions started doing runs with the

848
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,109
plan specifically then people started

849
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,298
talking about this plant this you know

850
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:48,339
because at the time even California

851
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:50,349
there was such a hype about Colorado and

852
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:52,149
Charlotte's Web and what it really was

853
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:54,129
and all these guys in California had no

854
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,840
clue so when you had these strains

855
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,080
popping up like sour tsunami and they're

856
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:02,470
like oh well it's just like sour tsunami

857
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:04,990
no and then you had Harlequin popping up

858
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,819
in the harbor side down by Oakland and

859
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,990
that was one of the stronger three two

860
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,789
one two two ones they're like no it's

861
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,858
nothing like Charlotte's Web and then

862
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:14,079
this ac/dc plant started to come around

863
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:16,059
you know and people just started

864
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
comparing them because no one knew as

865
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:19,779
all these new strains are coming out and

866
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,059
from Colorado is that a Colorado strain

867
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,909
the ac/dc you know okay alright just

868
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:28,840
really it started in Spain from what I

869
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:30,398
believe from where I understand it

870
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,159
started in Spain and somehow made its

871
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,719
way to California and then from that's

872
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,450
just from what I understand from what

873
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,489
I've been told you know as far as our

874
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:47,289
Colorado CBD strains you know R 4 R 5

875
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:48,579
the Wu 5 or as well known before Stu you

876
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:54,699
know the work that natural mystic

877
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:57,819
caregivers down here and absolutely

878
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:59,319
wonderful natural mystic for their one

879
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,289
of the only shops that really focuses

880
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,840
heavily on CBD absolutely this three or

881
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:07,509
four different kinds of top-shelf flower

882
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,710
that are CBD dominant it's actually one

883
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,000
of my favorite places in the springs to

884
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,250
go to for see buddy fire because you

885
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,559
know I support any place that will put

886
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,210
good CVD products on the chef and I know

887
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,210
the growers there I know Joey pretty

888
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,639
well yeah

889
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,900
hope you listenin bro well else was I

890
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,118
gonna ask you got so many questions you

891
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,289
were talking about labs that getting

892
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,660
your stuff tested you have a lab that

893
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:30,509
you prefer well there was a friend of

894
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,949
ours that has an independent lab and he

895
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,920
really does help a lot of people with

896
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:37,409
low-cost testing and does his part to

897
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,088
help you know Colorado law has made a

898
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:42,690
little hard for caregivers patients

899
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:45,719
parents to have their right you know

900
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,940
meds tested because obviously most labs

901
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,209
are forced to deal with people that have

902
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,409
MIPS licenses whatever the case is so

903
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,000
there are those few independent people

904
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:56,909
who have taken upon themselves with

905
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,260
their own dollar to provide a place

906
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:00,269
where patients can have their meds

907
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,250
tested and there's actually a place like

908
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:03,929
that down here in the springs I don't

909
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,969
have all the information so I don't want

910
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,739
to shout no worries yeah that's all

911
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,980
right yeah Nate knows who he is and he's

912
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,329
definitely killing it down here so once

913
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,070
I get more information I'll gladly pass

914
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,299
along your way and we can share it you

915
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,920
know sounds great yeah we'll get it out

916
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,810
- yeah he's the one who did the testing

917
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,970
for the cannabis cup entry that Caleb

918
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,588
and I did he's done some other testing

919
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,509
for the oil that I've done before and

920
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:26,219
and the numbers of those comes spot-on

921
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,930
to the point where if I go somewhere

922
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,909
else and I feel like my numbers aren't

923
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:32,489
right I go to Nate because my numbers

924
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,789
record sweet you know that's I can count

925
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:35,368
on that

926
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:36,900
alright so the Cannabis Cup is coming up

927
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,710
its January you guys were recording a

928
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,869
2016 and it sounds so weird to say that

929
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,150
you do anything for the Cup this year so

930
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,390
there are some few plans for the cup I'm

931
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,920
keeping myself open right now the way

932
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,509
that they split up so cow for the two

933
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
weekends is a little confusing so

934
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,099
honestly that is why we kind of backed

935
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,589
out of doing anything so quickly but I

936
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:00,119
had some things going obviously you know

937
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:02,159
with whatever happens in Denver we'll

938
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,769
have a showing out and there is

939
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,509
something in California that just

940
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:08,880
calling my attention that you know a few

941
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,430
people reach out you never know you what

942

00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:59,210
whatever they want to do for Colorado

961
00:37:55,608 --> 00:38:01,670
it'll be great so you know that the meed

962
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,289
has their feelings about how cannabis

963
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:08,119
events should be and what they are

964
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:10,130
Colorado they have a huge opposition to

965
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,229
a lot of the way that these events are

966
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,559
run what's your two cents if I can ask

967
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:17,328
personally on how that goes here for

968
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,160
people like us you know that obviously

969
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,739
have companies and promote within as

970
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:24,978
well as the people who enjoy these

971
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:27,739
events wait does what it does for me as

972
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:30,348
I work for a meed regulated dispensary

973
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:32,059
so I can't take my seed company and set

974
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,039
up a booth because I'm affiliated with

975
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,619
that dispensary so closely that I'll be

976
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:38,630

00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:43,460
understand that oh my god

980
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,338
when you get your meed badge that's part

981
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,900
of what you sign but I feel that

982
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:50,239
dispensaries this is Colorado we're

983
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,469
allowed to smoke everyone there's 21 and

984
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:57,469
over it's in an enclosed area we should

985
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:59,088
be able to the dispensary should be able

986
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,068
to go and set up a booth and show our

987
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:03,349
wares just like any other industry we

988
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:05,239
have beer festivals where I'm not gonna

989
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,068
name any beer brands but whatever brand

990
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,389
AB&amp;C bring their beer truck they set a

991
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:10,068
beer they serve it to people all day

992
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:11,808
they shut down whole blocks you know

993
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,639
yeah whole blocks of downtown Denver

994
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,989
we're doing this at a private event area

995
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,629
at the I forget the name of the place

996
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:19,249
the Ducks X no it's not denver mart yes

997
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,349
there were renting a place where they've

998
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:22,759
been doing it in the city blocks I think

999
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,769
that the dispensary should be able to

1000
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:26,748
come set up a booth and bring smoke and

1001
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:28,608
smoke you and I out and everybody out

1002
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:30,199
they should say this is our flagship

1003
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:31,818
strain this is what we grow come check

1004
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,468
us out I think it should be fully

1005
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:34,170
allowed yeah absolutely yeah it's kind

1006
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,700
of crap it's not

1007
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,409
great I'm glad to get your two cents on

1008
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:39,569
that yes you know being an independent

1009
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:42,480
caregiver on the other side of it I

1010
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,340
don't necessarily have to answer to them

1011
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,070
but at some point you know we cross

1012
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,559
paths and things are mentioned so it's

1013
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,690
interesting for people that are running

1014
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,059
within that model in Colorado and how

1015
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,710
that affects us for trying to actively

1016
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,219
promote at events like this you know

1017
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:01,260
without being threatened with fines or

1018
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,899
whatever the case may be you know fines

1019
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,580
in your business clothes absolutely big

1020
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,650
enough fine green and healthy is a small

1021
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:09,929
small business just a few of us and a

1022
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,369
large enough fund would end us that

1023
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:17,869
would be the end so we have to be pretty

1024
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:21,359
careful on that I'll be down there open

1025
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:23,219
we're officially open oh yeah this will

1026
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,539
come out we're open today but this will

1027
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,909
come out like two weeks so we'll be

1028
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,139

1031
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:33,689
he thinks of the perfect check out the

1032
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,549
shop there's more rigs there and some

1033
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,480
stuff you'd want to see awesome I took

1034
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,180
some notes but I think I've gone through

1035
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,679
them man I love how cool Colorado

1036
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:43,129
Springs is we don't have one of these in

1037
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,389
Pueblo so this is kind of children yeah

1038
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,369
there may be one but it's real low-key

1039
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:49,109
and I haven't gone there yet I think

1040
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,859
it's open yet so as soon as it opens

1041
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,599

just let us come hang out do a podcast

1046
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:02,369

1047
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:04,469
come say hi hear me it's cool I'm not

1048

1049
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:10,230
great poster I love it

1050
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:11,789
everyone here is super gracious yeah

1051
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,990
I'll be here a lot more often alright

1052
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:14,099
bro we've been going for like 40 minutes

1053
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:15,599
you got anything else that you want to

1054
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,549
throw out to the world about CBD while

1055
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:23,460
you're on the microphone you will be

1056
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:24,810
back on the show you know I I started

1057
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,320
this company because obviously something

1058
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:31,380
happened to me you know somebody that I

1059
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,660
couldn't help my goal is to help as many

1060
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,130
people as I can because if you know that

1061
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:38,190
feeling of

1062
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:41,039
not being able to help someone but then

1063
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,858
or put in a position where you can why

1064
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,930
not right you know and so every day I

1065
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:48,150
encourage people to learn something new

1066
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:50,098
about cannabis and I encourage people to

1067
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,660
take up a cause that's close to them it

1068
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,999
doesn't matter what it is no matter what

1069
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,159
it is for me it's epilepsy awareness and

1070
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:58,618
I will talk about it and so my face

1071
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,058
turns blue and you know more about

1072
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,829
epilepsy than you did and before we

1073
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,200
started talking I learned a lot today

1074
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:06,210
I'm really glad so that being said like

1075
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,098
