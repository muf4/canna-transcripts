uh let's talk more about my podcast

169
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,279
since we got you on my show bro

170
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,439
i love it that your uh your light is

171
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,159
called the canon it fits perfectly

172
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,639
uh i switched to using canons i went

173
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
from

174
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,639
hbs lights to cannons and i love it so i

175
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,439
think calling it a cannon is perfect

176
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,439
because it

177
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,759
the first time i plugged it in dude i

178
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,279
looked away like oh no i blinked i put

179
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
my hands up it felt like i was getting

180
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,719
assaulted by light so it's a cannon dude

181
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
i got shot in the face with so much

182
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
light the first time i plugged it in

183
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,758
i did not expect that i knew it would be

184
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
bright but it was like

185
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,680
oh it was offensive and assaulting and

186
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
it's amazing

187
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,639
so i've gushed enough about your life

188
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,159
yeah that's that's no that's what the

189
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
light guy did he's like

190
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
and he got me with the light and then he

191
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
pirated me uh

192
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,879
so i love the lights i've seen a lot of

193
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,639
great performance from my lights

194
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,319
i know what my plants are doing but i

195
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
don't know that i understand

196
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,560
why so i brought you on to kind of teach

197
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
me about my new lights

198
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
let you teach the audience about led

199
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
lights i'll let you kind of

200
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
teach me the basics you always talk

201
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
about the mccree curve and you talk

202
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,079
about a lot of scientific stuff that

203
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
honestly

204
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,199
when it comes to growing i understand

205
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,560
the plants like their people i talk to

206
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,478
the plants like they're people i pet

207
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,959
them like they're pets and animals

208
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,159
when it comes to lights that is where i

209
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,519
lack the most

210
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,600
info my brain simply doesn't

211
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
it doesn't care like no offense to the

212
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
light thing i care about the plants the

213
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,159
nutrients the water

214
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,839
i could see that the numbers and those

215
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,080
charts and things my brain goes

216
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,959
what i don't want to know that so i've

217
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,519
got some white

218
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,638
uh ignorance and some white uh add i

219
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,799
guess so

220
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,160
i think you can teach me in a great way

221
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,439
to understand light so i'm going to quit

222
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
rambling and i'm going to give you the

223
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,439
opportunity

224
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
to teach me about leds so uh you talk

225
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,759
about the mccree curve and you talk

226
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
about leds

227
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
where should you start bro what would

228
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,240
you want to teach me first

229
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
um yeah man i mean there's really

230
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
there's a lot of

231
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
different like terms and numbers to kind

232
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,279
of get used to uh but there's really as

233
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,000
a grower there's only like two or three

234
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,399
things that you have to know

235
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
um and i would probably i'll probably

236
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,918
start off

237
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,079
explaining spectrum and and color

238
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,159
temperatures and all that because that's

239
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,318
that's what everybody wants to hear

240
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,360
about um

241
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,360
everybody's hard for that [ __ ] so that's

242
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
where we're gonna begin

243
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
excellent um so let's let's figure out

244
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,290
spectrum real quick i'm gonna share my

245
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
screen

246
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,520
[Music]

247
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:29,038
and uh and get started here cool

248
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,318
so um all white light is

249
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,519
composed of uh

250
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,520
all the different colors of light

251
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,719
and they all mix together to make white

252
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,359
and then if you run

253
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,440
white light through a prism it breaks up

254
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
into a beautiful rainbow

255
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,719
so all the visible colors of light are

256
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,439
there uh you know

257
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
from uh purple and violet up into blue

258
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,399
green

259
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,560
yellow and orange red and they're all

260
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,000
there in different amounts

261
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,839
you know so you can look at like the

262
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
light bulbs in your house and see like

263
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,478
oh this one's got a little bit more of

264
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
like an orange

265
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,758
yellow in it and then i turn on the

266
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
fluorescent light in my kitchen and you

267
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
can see

268
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,719
like this one has a higher proportion of

269
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,639
blue they're all mixed in there together

270
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,400
but they're all in different amounts

271
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,400
and that's white light um

272
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,399
so that leaves us with the question of

273
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,120
uh what

274
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,679
what amount of each color do we want to

275
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
use

276
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,598
in our indoor gardens and um

277
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,878
that question luckily has an answer and

278
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,479
it's had an answer

279
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,839
for a really long time and uh

280
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,278
that answer is specific

281
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,190
to cannabis sorry let me get this

282
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,719
slideshow working again

283
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,360
[Music]

284
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,800
there you go there we go so uh this guy

285
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,360
dr mccree uh i assumed he was a doctor

286
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,559
maybe he was just really smart

287
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,919
um but he went through in the 80s

288
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,879
and tested each different color of light

289
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,838
on a bunch of different plants including

290
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,958
cannabis

291
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,600
so he must have been pretty [ __ ] cool

292
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,039
um and like you can see the rainbow in

293
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
here you know right over here at the

294
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,079
left and you've got

295
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
violet it comes in through the blue to

296
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
the green into the red

297
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,799
and uh you know when mccree started

298
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,559
testing out different uh colors of light

299
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,838
he found out that red was the jam

300
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,239
and it works at 100 relative efficiency

301
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
and then he got blue coming in around 80

302
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,278
percent

303
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,320
and green coming in around 60 percent

304
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,559
um so yeah this is the par curve

305
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
and it's it's based on the greek curve

306
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,759
for cannabis

307
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,919
and this is kind of if you ever hear the

308
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,000
term par

309
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,759
uh it stands for photosynthetically

310
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,559
active radiation

311
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,120
which is just a fancy way of saying life

312
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,919
you know

313
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,440
and okay it's not it's not one of like

314
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
the three things that you really need to

315
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
memorize

316
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,920
we'll get to those this is all just kind

317
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:05,599
of background information

318
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,439
so so far i see so far i see that plants

319
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
don't really care for uh this green and

320
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
yellow stuff but they're loving the reds

321
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
and they're loving they're liking the

322
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
blues

323
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,920
is that correct um yeah man i mean

324
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,879
honestly i think that matching this

325
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,439
curve

326
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,240
is uh going to give you superior plant

327
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
health

328
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,600
um okay i'll get to that in a second but

329
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,719
all right

330
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
i just want to make sure i'm following

331
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,519
along correctly yeah and people have

332
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,278
tried

333
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,799
just growing with red and blue those are

334
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,958
those purple leds

335
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,240
uh that you know they're still on the

336
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,759
market

337
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
um unfortunately uh the single color red

338
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,200
and blue diodes are really

339
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,360
expensive so it's it's not really

340
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
advantageous to just have red and blue

341
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,680
like you want like a full spectrum white

342
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
light that also includes green

343
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,719
and uh the first floral lights were

344
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,879
invented

345
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
uh by nasa so that they could grow

346
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,679
lettuce on the international space

347
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,518
station

348
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,120
cool and they just wanted the red and

349
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,639
blue because when you're

350
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
i guess when you're in [ __ ] outer

351
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,600
space like every watt

352
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,519
count like they're they're like phd is

353
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,600
trying to save like every tiny little

354
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,240
scrap of electricity

355
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,278
uh because they're in [ __ ] space yeah

356
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
um

357
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,000
so then you would yeah you would just

358
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,519
use red and blue because they are the

359
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
most efficient

360
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,039
but besides just the efficiency of

361
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,320
driving photosynthesis

362
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:34,078
there's uh the plant response

363
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,920
that that is kind of like a separate

364
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,239
factor

365
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,399
you know so you might think you want to

366
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
use all red but you would actually end

367
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,839
up with a [ __ ] up plant

368
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,120
okay the plants are the boss yeah

369
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,200
exactly all right so

370
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,078
uh superimposed on the paragraph now

371
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,759
we've got

372
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,799
kind of the uh the spectrum graphs of

373
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,319
different colored led grow lights

374
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:11,199
and also hps lights

375
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:13,278
so um

376
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
i really like the 3500k color

377
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,039
temperature it's my favorite that's what

378
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
all my lights have always come

379
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,519
standard in uh i only recently started

380
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,159
offering the

381
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,679
3000k color temperature as like an

382
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,278
option

383
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,759
okay um because i think 3500k is perfect

384
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,838
and yeah on that graph it looks great

385
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,639
right yeah it's the green one and it it

386
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,320
just almost

387
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,360
perfectly matches that that ideal

388
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,399
spectrograph for cannabis

389
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,440
you know so uh you get really

390
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,078
healthy looking short pushing plants

391
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
with

392
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,679
[ __ ] dense frosty nugs yeah

393
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,959
huge praying leaves dude pointing

394
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,919
straight up

395
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,278
the plants just love it man they do i

396
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,599
they really do and i'm not just trying

397
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,879
to

398
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,320
you know just because i use the lights

399
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,399
because you're my bro they do love it i

400
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
see huge differences in my plants

401
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
i kind of had to relearn how to grow my

402
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,000
nutrients are different

403
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
uh my environment is different it was a

404
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,958
big adjustment and the plants are

405
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,720
happier they're much happier

406
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,319
so yeah i do see a huge difference in

407
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
the performance

408
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,079
definitely man that's why i think it's

409
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,799
just really best to get that

410
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,199
uh proper balance between red and blue

411
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,240
and

412
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,519
uh and stick with it you know 3500k and

413
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,440
also 3000k

414
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:35,278
is a little bit more red um

415
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,279
but it's still also very close so

416
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,198
with 3500k you're going to get a little

417
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,639
bit shorter internodes

418
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:46,000
and uh potentially um some frostier

419
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,919
uh plants and flour and with 50 000k

420
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,679
your nodes might be a little bit longer

421
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,679
and you're potentially going to get some

422
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,039
bigger yields in flour

423
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,719
you know all right you know i'm used to

424
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,120
i'm i'm the old-school grower i'm used

425
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
to switching from the halides to the hbs

426
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
as i switch into flour do i still want

427
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,480
to stick with my same led light and just

428
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
keep my uh

429
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
my cannons up the whole time are you

430
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,198
gonna start giving me veg lights and

431
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,879
flowering lights

432
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:16,240
honestly man uh the differences between

433
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,559
3500 kelvin and 3000 kelvin are going to

434
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
be

435
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,479
very subtle and the last thing i wanted

436
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,959
to say about spectrum was to stop

437
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,079
[ __ ] worrying about spectrum

438
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:31,278
because it's really it's really

439
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,838
not that important

440
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,078
if you just one of the one of the two

441
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,720
things you need to remember about leds

442
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,919
is to get 3500k or 3000k for your color

443
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
temperature

444
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,879
i don't know what a kelvin is i don't

445
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,159
know why it's 3 000

446
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:53,600
uh i just know that

447
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,439
like 3000 is a little more red 3500 has

448
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,800
a little bit more blue

449
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,600
and i think 3500 has the best balance of

450
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:05,519
red and blue for full cycle

451
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,360
um and it's my favorite you know

452
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,799
if you're really just focused on flour

453
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
if you're never going to badge with this

454
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,679
light

455
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,599
sometimes people like to get the 3 000

456
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,359
kelvin if if they're a little bit more

457
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
focused on trying to get the best yield

458
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,639
they can

459
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,159
um you do have a good reason to believe

460
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,039
you might get a slightly higher yield

461
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,719
with 3 000

462
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,480
because you've got a little bit more red

463
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
in there

464
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,039
um but the other important thing about

465
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,320
your red red and blue balance is that it

466
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,159
determines the height of the plant

467
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
and that's really the important thing

468
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,120
with spectrum

469
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,039
is that it's going to determine the

470
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,078
height of the plant

471
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,399
like if you look at

472
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:44,399
uh

473
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,320
one thing i've noticed is my plants are

474
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,639
much bushier

475
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
tighter tighter inner node spacing

476
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,759
squattier

477
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
i don't stretch nearly as much and that

478
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,639
transition uh the three weeks from

479
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,079
veg to flower i was used to my plants

480
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
taking off i could have vegged for

481
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,879
another week because they didn't go as

482
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,879
hard as i'm used to

483
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,799
with the leds so that was advantageous

484
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,159
for sure

485
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:17,198
yeah man um well what i was

486
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,319
hang on what i was going to show you

487
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,319
was that you went

488
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,159
okay so what i wanted to show you was

489
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,039
how you went from uh

490
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,799
high pressure sodium to a 3500k led

491
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,399
oh i was missing a lot i wasn't getting

492
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,679
any of that blue and i was missing the

493
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
peak red part

494
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,638
right yeah exactly all right yeah look

495
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
at that hps spectrum man that yellow

496
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
orange color should be very familiar

497
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
you know yeah that's what the room looks

498
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
like

499
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,399
right so this goes to show you two

500
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,559
things that if you're really heavy on

501
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,120
red without the blue to balance it out

502
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,758
you're going to get taller plants you

503
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
know

504
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
um so it kind of illustrates it right

505
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,360
there and then it does

506
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,759
also show you um

507
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,679
kind of how like spectrum really has a

508
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,279
limited impact on the plant

509
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
because i mean we've been growing really

510
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,480
dank [ __ ] with high pressure sodium for

511
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,798
decades

512
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
and if you look at it compared to the

513
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,439
recurve i mean that spectrum's kind of

514
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
[ __ ] up

515
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
and there's a really big difference

516
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,600
between an hps

517
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,240
and and a full spectrum led

518
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,838
but the plants still grow great under

519
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,640
hps like you still get

520
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,839
frosty nugs and big yields it's just

521
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,919
they're a bit taller

522
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,319
um so that's really the only major

523
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,320
difference you're gonna be seeing

524
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,678
i think they eat better i think since

525
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,918
we're giving them

526
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,519
uh the things they want spectrum wise

527
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,120
they're able to photosynthesize and

528
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,038
metabolize and process

529
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,719
the food better i had to up some

530
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,319
nutrients and i had to lower some

531
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,519
because they didn't need some nutrients

532
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,038
because they were getting fed

533
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,798
enough of the other things i had to kind

534
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,480
of adjust a little bit so i think the

535
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,759
plants are just they're happier with the

536
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
led

537
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,038
i just think it's closer to what they

538
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,319
it's by looking at the graph it tells me

539
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,919
for sure it's closer to what they

540
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,519
actually wanted

541
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,440
right yeah no totally it's it's almost

542
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,038
dead on

543
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,480
and um it's so close that you really

544
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,038
don't need to like i've tried all the

545
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,000
different

546
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,400
like spectrums combined i've tried like

547
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,279
supplementing reds and blues and all

548
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
that different stuff

549
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,200
and mixed them all together in crazy

550
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
ways and honestly i've never seen

551
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
anything work much better than 3500k or

552
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,918
3000k

553
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,759
just on its own you know um

554
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,080
if if you've got the extra money and the

555
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,759
extra time you can have fun doing that

556
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,599
you know and mixing in a bunch of little

557
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,720
tiny different colors and stuff

558
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,038
and your light's gonna look like a

559
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,600
spaceship it's [ __ ] cool fun

560
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,599
yeah but if you want to get the job done

561
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,599
you know yeah until the aliens come and

562
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,919
give us new technology this is probably

563
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,439
uh i'm i'm really happy with my leds

564
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,880
i've said it before on shows but i don't

565
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,759
know if i've told you this

566
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,679
the seeds i made under led lights are

567
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
the best seeds i've ever made

568
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,960
i've been making seeds for years

569
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,639
countless years i can't even remember

570
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,200
when i started making seeds

571
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,679
and when i used leds my seeds were

572
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,759
bigger

573
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,960
harder fatter healthier better

574
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,038
germination rate

575
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,160
more viable seeds per batch sometimes

576
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,679
you get those like

577
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
white seeds at the bottom of the plant

578
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
or seeds that just didn't quite get what

579
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,159
they needed

580
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,759
i had way less of those more usable

581
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
seeds in this last harvest

582
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,519
all grown under led and that tells me

583
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,038
that the plants are just healthier

584
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,960
just something naturally is happier

585
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,519
about that plant

586
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120
yeah no definitely man i've heard that

587
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,079
from a couple other breeders i think

588
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,839
that's awesome

589
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,199
uh i never would have known that if it

590
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,639
weren't for you guys because i never

591
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,000
grow any seeds

592
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
yeah you're welcome yeah man that's why

593
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,558
i really

594
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,720
i've been growing with these lights for

595
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,359
years man i really think the best thing

596
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
to do

597
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:57,199
is uh to find that proper balance and

598
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,599
to stick as close as possible to what

599
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,360
the plant really says it wants

600
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,199
yeah yeah and then just the plants are

601
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,959
the boss better yeah it's just an

602
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
overall health thing and if they're

603
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,840
if they're happy bro you know it oh yeah

604
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,119
they will clap their hands bro they will

605
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,038
clap their hands

606
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,399
yeah um i've got i've got questions but

607
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,000
i don't want to derail you too much so

608
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
let me keep you focused on your uh on

609
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,839
your

610
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,279
your beautiful presentation where are

611
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,000
you headed next for me buddy because i

612
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,038
don't want to throw you

613
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,960
off um i just wanted to

614
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,640
uh there was like one other thing i

615
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,480
wanted to say um

616
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,860
i wanted to show you guys the 5000

617
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,558
kelvin color temperature

618
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:35,678
[Music]

619
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,000
and uh you know that one i've grown with

620
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
it

621
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,240
and it's just a little too blue uh it

622
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,439
seems to be slowing down growth rates at

623
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,519
that point

624
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,000
um and uh also your nodes are just so

625
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,759
stacked dude like they're just right on

626
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
top of each other

627
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,200
and you end up having to do like a lot

628
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
of selective

629
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,960
uh you know pruning of side branches oh

630
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,158
yeah so

631
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,400
there is such a thing as like too short

632
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
oh yeah and too tight too squatty that

633
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,720
does become a problem yeah

634
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,038
right is there a is there a 4200 kelvin

635
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,079
is that a thing i can find and buy

636
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:15,359
there is a 4 000 kelvin um

637
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:18,399
but yeah you could buy it but honestly

638
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,439
like i wouldn't recommend it um

639
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,200
i think 3500 is pretty great i mean

640
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,400
that's that's what you're using and i

641
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,319
don't know like would you want your

642
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,960
notes to be any shorter

643
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,879
no no no they're beautiful if they get

644
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
any tighter it'll be problematic on some

645
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
plants

646
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,879
it would definitely make a difference

647
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah and i've talked about i may have

648
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,440
selected different plants

649
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,960
uh from my pheno selections in the past

650
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,400
i may have chosen different stuff

651
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
because of these lights

652
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
like they were growing they were

653
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,320
stretching and the plants were different

654
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
shapes because they were under hps

655
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,240
i'm under leds and the plants performed

656
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
completely differently and i'm like oh i

657
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
i should have gotten rid of that and

658
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,918
kept that stretching you know because

659
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,759
under this light it would have been

660
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,240
perfect but it was too tall so i tossed

661
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,919
it

662
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
yeah it probably would have changed my

663
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,640
selections for sure

664
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
yeah man it'll have uh it'll have a big

665
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
effect on plant height

666
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,480
um and then really minor effects in in

667
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,919
other places you know

668
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
yeah so i i think the the frost level is

669
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,759
there too

670
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,279
the the reds and the trichome

671
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,759
development it is there and you can see

672
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,960
it early i think it comes on early

673
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,279
definitely all right well uh actually

674
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,038
i've never grown with hps so i never had

675
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,038
anything to compare it to i grew up

676
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,119
yeah it did a good job it did a good job

677
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,599
my best until i had leds was when i

678
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,399
would put a metal halide and hps in the

679
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,240
same hood

680
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
and run those together that was my most

681
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
flavorful most potent most photogenic

682
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
herb ever

683
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,279
until i switched up to the leds and now

684
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,519
i think i can far surpass that

685
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,359
uh and it's much cooler i don't have to

686
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,558
fight so much cooling so that helps out

687
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,158
the environment a lot

688
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,240
until the winter came and then i needed

689
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
a heater i almost put up an hps again

690
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,440
just to keep my room cool or warm

691
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,720
because it got so cold that i didn't

692
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,759
know what to do that was the only

693
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,400
complaint that i had

694
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,879
it's like they're not hot enough yeah

695
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
okay so that kind of leads into one of

696
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,159
your questions if you wanted to

697
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
yeah yeah yeah i was going to say people

698
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,360
always say that led is cooler

699
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,359
and it is cooler uh in some way i'm

700
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,798
noticing that but i've got more wattage

701
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,639
in the room technically there are more

702
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,639
watts in there than there was when i was

703
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,200
running an hps the numbers are higher in

704
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,679
wattage

705
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
but the heat is lower i was taught that

706
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,000
a watt

707
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,440
is a lot because electricity is

708
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,640
electricity why am i getting

709
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,480
less heat out of that light

710
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,919
um so it's more efficient

711
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,000
so um a why

712
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,600
and this is dude wow this is something

713
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,440
that i've had like straight up

714
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,639
nerd fights on like all kinds of social

715
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,320
media about

716
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
because i'm not qualified to argue with

717
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,599
you so you're going to win this year

718
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:06,000
like no it's [ __ ] not so a y becomes

719
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,399
3.8 btus of heat

720
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,278
somewhere around there yeah but that's

721
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,159
only if it becomes heat

722
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:19,200
if it becomes light and then hits a leaf

723
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,278
then instead of that energy and that wad

724
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,558
of electricity becoming heat

725
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,919
it becomes chemical energy locked up in

726
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,639
the plant

727
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,520
you know chloroplast chloroplasts right

728
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
yeah that's what

729
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,720
that's what chlorophyll does is it turns

730
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,959
light

731
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,079
into sugar basically or into chemical

732
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,360
bonds

733
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,720
all right so that energy

734
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,119
cannot become chemical energy and heat

735
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,759
energy at the same time because the law

736
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:52,079
of thermodynamics

737
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:56,640
so you know like uh if you've got

738
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:58,399
like a 10 a 10 watt water pump

739
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,400
you know some of those 10 watts will

740
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,278
become heat but some of it will also

741
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
become

742
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,038
mechanical energy the energy of that

743
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,399
moving water

744
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,038
okay so you you have to and and whatever

745
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,960
whatever percentage of that energy that

746
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,679
does what the thing is supposed to do

747
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,440
is the efficiency and whatever's left

748
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
over is the heat

749
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
unless you're talking about a space

750
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
heater then it's just 100 heat because

751
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,038
that's what it's supposed to do

752
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,558
efficiency yeah okay so if the energy

753
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,158
becomes light then it's not really

754
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,079
becoming heat

755
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,159
um and uh so there's that

756
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,038
and then there's the way the heat that

757
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,039
an led does create gets distributed

758
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,400
like it all gets sucked up into a heat

759
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:45,679
sink and then kind of slowly radiated uh

760
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,120
from the surface of the metal um

761
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,440
so if you've got your lights hanging up

762
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,000
by your carbon filter by your exhaust

763
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,360
fan

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,640
uh then you're pumping out that heat

765
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,798
much more efficiently than an hps

766
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
which has a bunch of heat blasting

767
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,278
straight down

768
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,278
from the bulb onto your plants yeah

769
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,400
you know instead of slowly radiating

770
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,000
directly into your

771
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,519
uh exhaust bag okay that makes sense

772
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
yeah big old bright heat source just

773
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,639
throwing heat out and then you've got

774
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
that efficient little tiny diode

775
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,240
that makes sense the heat source is so

776
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,480
much smaller that it makes sense anyway

777
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,759
but that was a a beautiful explanation

778
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,679
because honestly

779
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,679
i think i was believing the nerds that a

780
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,200
lot is a lot but the way you said that

781
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,679
uh even my uh non-physics understanding

782
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,278
self

783
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,720
got a good grasp of that so that was

784
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:33,679
perfect thank you man it didn't become

785
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
heat it became

786
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,919
plant energy because it was the right uh

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
type of light that the plant can use it

788
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,278
and it didn't get wasted off his heat

789
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
right cool that makes sense for you man

790
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,798
do you notice that all right

791
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,158
the difference in a commercial grow like

792
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,918
from when the plants are small

793
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,360
when the entire room is just completely

794
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,520
covered in canopy

795
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,199
theoretically the room should get cooler

796
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,759
does that happen

797
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,278
uh yeah i think so yeah i noticed the

798
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,798
humidity more it's more

799
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,480
funky and damp in there because all the

800
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,839
plants but yeah i do notice it takes

801
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
more to change the temperature when

802
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,278
there are a lot of plants in there

803
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:11,599
for sure yeah i'm not exactly sure

804
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,720
uh yeah i think it does it stays cooler

805
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,240
in there because the plants are putting

806
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
out so much water that it's cool in

807
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
there but then it gets so humid

808
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,079
i kind of want to put a big room a

809
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,440
commercial room filled with leds i

810
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,798
haven't done that yet i've just got

811
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,480
small spaces

812
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,879
but that's gonna i'm going to have to

813
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,880
rethink everything once i do that all of

814
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,559
the hvac all of the airflow

815
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,399
it'll all be a totally different

816
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,918
redesign which is going to throw me for

817
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,119
a loop and i can't wait i love those

818
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,480
loops

819
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,158
yeah man uh so

820
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,360
what can other i know what i can expect

821
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,200
because i've done it now that i

822
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,439
understand the heat part other than

823
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,038
uh i switched to eight leds in the

824
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,960
middle of the winter and that was

825
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,558
a mistake i should not have done that so

826
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,038
that's something i can warn people about

827
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:52,960
if you're

828
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,079
relying on the light for heat don't

829
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
switch in the middle of winter because

830
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,398
you won't measure grow up

831
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,959
what else can people expect to expect

832
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,398
when they switch from an hps or a cmh

833
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
to the leds because there is a little

834
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,239
bit of a learning curve can you warn us

835
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,840
about anything

836
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,599
yeah um so there's gonna be potentially

837
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,000
some changes in your feeding

838
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,918
uh they might you know a lot of people

839
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,278
say they need more calcium and veg and a

840
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,399
little bit more magnesium yeah

841
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,480
flour um

842
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,879
so yeah if you've got a really dialed in

843
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,919
feeding regimen with a really well-known

844
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
strain

845
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,480
um the run where you switch your lights

846
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,480
up

847
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,399
like you can't just be on autopilot like

848
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,240
you were on the last 20 runs like you

849
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,439
are gonna have to watch that plant again

850
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
because it's gonna be feeding

851
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,600
differently

852
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,159
yeah um and the temperature is gonna be

853
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,079
different

854
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,440
so uh you're gonna want to get one of

855
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,759
these

856
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
uh an infrared thermometer and you're

857
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,558
gonna be able to check the surface

858
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,000
temperature

859
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,158
of your leaf because uh

860
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,759
if you're used to growing with cmh or

861
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,919
hps there's a lot more

862
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,960
infrared and a lot more downward facing

863
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
heat

864
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,720
so the actual temperature of your leaf

865
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,120
is usually

866
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,240
if i'm not mistaken usually higher than

867
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,359
the ambient temperature of the room

868
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,120
um but with leds uh

869
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,079
you know and i can pull this screen up

870
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,079
again real quick

871
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,599
so over here to the right side of the of

872
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,599
the red portion of this graph is where

873
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,278
you get into infrared

874
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,439
and you can see on the graph that the

875
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,240
leds drop off really sharply

876
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,798
and they don't put out any it hasn't

877
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
there you go

878
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:41,038
there you go now over here on the right

879
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,038
that uh right where this curve drops off

880
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,200
is where you go from far red into

881
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,679
infrared which is heat

882
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,038
and you can see how the leds really drop

883
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,480
off right there and they don't

884
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,038
put out any infrared so what's going to

885
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,278
happen

886
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,558
is your beef surface temperature is

887
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,880
going to be

888
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,240
almost exactly the same as the ambient

889
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,039
temperature of your room

890
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
cool so some people will be like oh put

891
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,480
infrared on your

892
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,080
grow lights and i'm like okay let's

893
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,200
think this through real quick

894
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,199
you want to spend extra money

895
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,798
on an led light that's going to reduce

896
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,038
your temperatures

897
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,000
and then you want to spend extra more

898
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,960
money

899
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
on an infrared light that's going to

900
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,038
raise your temperatures

901
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,119
back up again but

902
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,398
all you have to do is turn down your ac

903
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,439
a few degrees

904
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,678
and raise the temperature of your

905
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,038
your ambient temperature of your garden

906
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,640
and then that will raise the leaf

907
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,359
surface temperature up to where you want

908
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,600
it

909
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,398
and and you're spending less money on ac

910
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,000
which is the whole

911
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,519
[ __ ] point yeah getting more

912
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
efficient light

913
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,440
instead of spending more money on making

914
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,519
your light hotter

915
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,960
so you can run your ac harder and get

916
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,440
the same right it's like

917
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,399
yeah my my electric bill has gone down

918
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,480
quite a bit

919
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,558
quite a bit since i switched leds i'm

920
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,839
not running the big hps's so they're not

921
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,319
sucking up so much juice but then i

922
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,839
don't have so many fans and acs going

923
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,200
i don't have to fight the room so much

924
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,079
so yeah it definitely made a big

925
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,319
difference

926
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,839
big difference i'm so glad i converted

927
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,079
you man

928
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,759
yeah i was uh i was hesitant i was

929
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,199
skeptical for a long time

930
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,640
but well i always called it a light

931
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
bright because i saw those silly purple

932
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
things and i was like that's not dude

933
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,798
and i saw so many weird mixed results

934
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,158
from plants

935
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,918
i called it a light bright but then when

936
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,240
i saw what yours were doing and then

937
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,840
we worked out a nice nice thing it was

938
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,200
definitely worth it i'm glad i did it so

939
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,759
good job man thank you good sales

940
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,000
pitching

941
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,278
you stayed on me for a minute i'm

942
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
looking to see if i have any more notes

943
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,519
i think we've answered most of my

944
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,278
questions

945
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,558
uh the changes i noticed we're going to

946
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,640
change are

947
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,918
feeding and plant structure and growth

948
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,960
we're not going to get as much stretch

949
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,080
as i'm used to

950
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,759
a little bit tighter nodes um i may have

951
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,199
needed a heater it may have been wise to

952
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,000
put in a heater during the winter but

953
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,640
other than that

954
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,720
i think i nailed it do you offer any

955
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,679
products with a far red light or is that

956
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,440
something coming in the future

957
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,679
um yeah not really man i mean i've

958
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
i've done it all like i've i've tried

959
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,798
far reds

960
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
i guess uh probably a grow mouse puck

961
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,158
would be your best bet if you want to

962
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,679
[ __ ] around with far red

963
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,000
but um what we're all about at black

964
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,679
sale

965
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,038
market is um

966
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,640
building really big high quality

967
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,319
high intensity full spectrum leds

968
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,919
because all of my experience and

969
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,038
everything i've learned has shown me

970
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,519
that that's what

971
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,278
gets the job done you need the proper

972
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,640
intensity you need a big [ __ ] off

973
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,398
powerful light

974
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,759
uh and yeah as efficient as possible

975
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:45,199
uh and as cheap as possible um

976
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,200
so that's always been

977
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,679
like my ethic and like my my what what's

978
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,600
guided me in the design of all my likes

979
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,278
is is that goal and um

980
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,959
like i just that's how you get the job

981
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,119
done man i think there's a lot of really

982
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
overpriced and over engineered lights

983
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,239
out there

984
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:10,559
and all you really need to know is 3500k

985
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:14,240
3000k and hit the proper intensity

986
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:17,440
you know so like for instance um

987
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,200
like my 640 watt two pack uh

988
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,080
it will give you maximum growth rates

989
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,519
and yields in flour over a four by four

990
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,038
in veg over a five by five and it's on

991
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,519
sale for six hundred and sixty-five

992
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,000
dollars with coupon code ross to jeff

993
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,919
so you know if you know your leds you

994
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,839
know that's an amazing deal

995
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,480
and that like we're really not we're not

996
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,599
[ __ ] around over here

997
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,960
you know i loved it i wasn't gonna bring

998
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,000
it up because it wasn't important but i

999
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,079
could feel your

1000
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
uh your army training come through like

1001
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,199
get the [ __ ] job

1002
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
done we don't need extra [ __ ] we don't

1003
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,759
need frills we don't need bells we don't

1004
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,760
need whistles

1005
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,960
we don't need [ __ ] fancy glitter tape

1006
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,038
get the job

1007
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,399
done i love that approach and uh i'm

1008
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,839
gonna compliment you i've been to

1009
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,918
your workspace i've been to your old

1010
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,959
workspace and your new workspace

1011
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,038
you guys his workspace is immaculate you

1012
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
can sit down and eat dinner off of his

1013
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,398
workspace floor

1014
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,320
uh i complimented him one time i said

1015
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,159
dude you cleaned the [ __ ] corner that

1016
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,838
i would have missed

1017
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,440
he gets in there you know there's that

1018
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,799
corner it's right here that everybody

1019
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,519
like you swept everything but right

1020
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,919
there there's a little

1021
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,039
schmeck in the corner he gets that stuff

1022
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,638
so that tells me

1023
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,159
uh the way that somebody does something

1024
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,838
is the way they do everything so that

1025
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,599
tells me those lights are put together

1026
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:30,960
but the corners have been cleaned and

1027
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,159
dusted so that's that's a good

1028
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
compliment to you bro thank you for

1029
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,720
taking such good care of your customers

1030
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,000
thank you man you didn't know i was

1031
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,398
coming to inspect so

1032
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,199
it was super clean i showed up randomly

1033
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,039
bro

1034
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,678
surprise inspection yep

1035
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,239
no it's uh i mean and that's honestly

1036
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,159
like that

1037
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:55,039
that very uh rugged kind of utilitarian

1038
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,639
sort of like if the army was going to

1039
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,239
build a grow light it would probably

1040
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,838
look a lot like mine

1041
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,559
like it gets the job done man it's a

1042
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,960
[ __ ] tank

1043
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,559
and it will get the job done it might be

1044
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,760
olive green or something instead of

1045
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,400
black but

1046
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,720
yeah now you just sold them an idea

1047
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,039
they're going to come out with that

1048
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,078
i've actually got a lot of irie genetics

1049
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,358
growing under my

1050
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,560
uh under my canon leds so excellent

1051
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,400
i like it when you show off those

1052
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,078
pictures

1053
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,760
i mean it's one thing to hear us talk

1054
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,800
about it but it's another thing to see

1055
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,000
it for yourself

1056
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,200
you know and uh that's so that's

1057
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
three of my 320 watt canyons over a four

1058
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,239
by six

1059
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
and that's four orange gasms in there

1060
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,799
filling out a formula

1061
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
that looks really really good do you

1062
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,440
have those

1063
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,480
leds at full power or are they turned

1064
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,358
down at all

1065
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,159
no they're at full power okay so each

1066
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:54,239
one's covering a two by four basically

1067
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:57,598
all right um what is that in flower

1068
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,279
um everything all my coverage areas and

1069
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,320
recommendations on that front

1070
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,359
are designed for maximum yields

1071
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,400
in flour um so

1072
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,559
in veg because your day is 30

1073
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,000
longer you have to remember to turn that

1074
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,078
light down 30

1075
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,079
and they're all dimmable you know which

1076
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,880
is another really great thing about leds

1077
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,280
man

1078
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,280
um because if you're running the same

1079
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
amount of wattage in vegan flower you're

1080
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,519
[ __ ] up

1081
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,078
you know right the plants got a certain

1082
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,679
amount

1083
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,800
of uh of light that it can process in a

1084
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:34,480
day

1085
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,200
and in veg that day is 33 longer

1086
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,440
so the the intensity needs to be turned

1087
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,439
down 33

1088
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,960
you know if you start seeing the leaves

1089
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
start drooping you can't see my arms at

1090
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,199
the edge of the screen if the leaves

1091
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
start drooping

1092
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,919
and getting just a little bit weak

1093
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,838
toward the end of the day they're not

1094
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,280
dry they're not angry they're tired

1095
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,000
they've had enough light they want to go

1096
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,320
to sleep

1097
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
you can either uh reduce your amount of

1098
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,519
light that is coming out of that light

1099
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,358
or if you're on the right schedule you

1100
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,519
can reduce an hour of daylight

1101
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,799
uh don't over light the plants you can

1102
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,320
save electricity

1103
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
it doesn't matter a lot when you're

1104
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,440
running two cannons your electricity

1105
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,078
bill is not going to notice but when

1106
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,480
you're running

1107
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,240
a hundred gavitas that kind of stuff

1108
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,838
really adds up so learn everything you

1109
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,719
can just to make yourself a little bit

1110
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,719
more efficient

1111
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,239
and right now during these times bro

1112
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,519
paychecks are hard to get money is more

1113
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,879
expensive than ever so

1114
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,159
even if you are running two cannons

1115
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,599
maybe that will save you a difference

1116
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,159
maybe that's six bucks on the electric

1117
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,440
bill

1118
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,719
might get you somewhere these days

1119
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,400
that's a [ __ ] gallon of gas right now

1120
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:36,078
so yeah yeah money's expensive nowadays

1121
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:40,240
things are weird uh our our canon lights

1122
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,760
readily available oh yeah definitely man

1123
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,199
excellent i know you make them yourself

1124
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
and i know that supply chains are weird

1125
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,358
right now

1126
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,920
i was at the grow store trying to buy

1127
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,679
soil and nutrients and just basic things

1128
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,280
and half the stuff i wanted was sold out

1129
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,000
so knowing that your lights are there

1130
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,640
that makes me feel better yeah i have

1131
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
managed

1132
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,879
to uh i mean there's been some definite

1133
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,000
adjustments i've had to make

1134
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,039
and um you know i had to start ordering

1135
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,079
my inventory

1136
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:09,679
uh a lot farther ahead

1137
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,960
oh yeah you know yeah but so far man i

1138
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,399
haven't sold out i've come

1139
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,720
close dude i've been down to like my

1140
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
last two lights i'm like oh [ __ ]

1141
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,000
that's excellent yeah what are these

1142
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,358
boxes gonna get here

1143
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,358
uh but so far i haven't run out

1144
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,719
good let's assign a good business being

1145
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,119
worried that you're going to run out

1146
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,959
that's a sign of success coming your way

1147
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,039
that's that's a good job bro all right i

1148
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,159
think we've got a lot of great info out

1149
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,679
of you do you have anything you want to

1150
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,279
share with us before we start wrapping

1151
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,279
up this part of the show

1152
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,280
oh just real quick dude the third thing

1153
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,079
you need to know about leds

1154
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,760
is that uh to get the proper intensity

1155
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,039
in veg you need about 600 watts per 4x4

1156
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,680
of high quality full spectrum leds

1157
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,800
so forget about everything i just showed

1158
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,358
you with graphs

1159
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,839
and numbers all that [ __ ] forget about

1160
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,159
it

1161
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:04,400
just learn three things 3 000 kelvin
