00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,839
quality product that

162
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,439

at the start of the show when it comes

170
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,839
to my dad's recently i have been not

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
just recently lately

172
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,119
since probably the fall i've been in

173
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
love with

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,918
funky gross garlicky kind of turps if

175
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
it's real savory

176
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,758
garlicky funky body odory maybe some

177
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
armpits

178
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
ah i don't know it's got maybe a little

179
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,079
bit of hints of vomit in there i have

180
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,720
been

181
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,279
in love with those types of aromas and

182
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
so

183
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,559
i acquired a cut of the gmo a while back

184
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,240
and i loved it i was growing it i was

185
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,399
smoking it it was amazing

186
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
what's the next step for a breeder to do

187
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,560
to breed with the cuts that he has

188
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,560
acquired so i took my prized

189
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,839
king solomon male let's talk about

190
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,959
solomon briefly

191
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,560
uh arise is golden goat and daybreaker

192
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,560
it's a golden goat female

193
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
pollinated by a daybreaker male so i've

194
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
got a real sweet

195
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,439
tropical flavored female that i

196
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,639
pollinated with an og

197
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,038
kush chem dog cross of a male that made

198
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
my

199
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:31,279
arise that arise is very well known

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,600
for putting out high thc offspring

201
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:38,959
there are tests uh near 35 there's 35.84

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
uh there are a few other 34 and 33 thc a

203
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,560
test that come from a rise

204
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,478
so it very consistently puts out high

205
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
thc numbers

206
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,399
i found a male in there that i call king

207
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
solomon there's a lot to that if you

208
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,120
want to study king solomon you'll

209
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,439
understand why

210
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
solomon's got a lot of wives he's bred a

211
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,879
lot in my room

212
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,879
he's made a lot of quality offspring so

213
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,680
i know that king solomon is a champion i

214
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,000
know he makes

215
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
tremendous thc i kind of call him the

216
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
fixer if i've got a female plant

217
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
that doesn't grow the way that i would

218
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
like it to grow it doesn't produce the

219
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,560
way i would like it to produce

220
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,079
pollinate it with king solomon find a

221
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,079
phenotype that comes from there

222
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,839
it will be perfect it will correct the

223
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,038
problem and make it better it'll be the

224
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,439
original plant you had

225
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,399
plus better structure faster growth

226
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,598
hyper vigor

227
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,638
and more potency so solomon is my fixer

228
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,399
plant i call him

229
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,079
the king he is the [ __ ] king i have

230
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,560
not found a better male plant than that

231
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,199
so

232
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
i took my male king solomon plant and of

233
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,038
course i pollinated

234
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,478
the gmo let's talk a little bit about

235
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,719
gmo

236
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,318
um gmo i should the first thing i should

237
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
say is gmo does not

238
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
stand for garlic mushroom onions we'll

239
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,680
talk briefly about

240
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
the gmo name here gmo is a chem cookies

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,439
cross

242
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,079
and it was never meant to be garlic

243
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,319
mushroom

244
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,159
onions it has got chem dog in it it's

245
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
got girl scout cookies in it and it

246
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,759
smells

247
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,680
really funky there is a phenotype that

248
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
goes around colorado the phenotype that

249
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
i bred with

250
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,440
it came from a guy known as skunk master

251
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,038
flex what up skunk i hope you hear this

252
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,680
one day nothing but love and respect for

253
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,038
you

254
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,400
skunk called this plant the gmo

255
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,038
because it smelled funky and it is bred

256
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,439
to the girl scout cookies now at the

257
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,839
time

258
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,279
that this strain became popular the girl

259
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,959
scouts of america

260
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,119
were under scrutiny because it had been

261
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,079
discovered that their girl scout cookies

262
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,320
were being made

263
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,000
with gmo products and they weren't

264
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,959
quality cookies i'm not gonna even go

265
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,839
down that route

266
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,879
but that is where the gmo came from it

267
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
smells crazy

268
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,360
it smells funky it smells like chemicals

269
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
so that gives you a weird gmo vibe

270
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,320
already

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
it's got girl scout cookies in it so

272
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
that leads us to

273
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
the girl scout cookies being discovered

274
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
that their product was filled

275
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,799
with gmos and non-desirable [ __ ] for us

276
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,480
to put in our bodies

277
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,240
and they're selling it to us at a

278
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
premium so it was

279
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
the gmo and the girl scout cookies is

280
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,240
what sparked

281
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
the idea to call it gmo it is not garlic

282
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
mushroom onions

283
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
it may smell like garlic mushroom onions

284
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,120
to some people i had a concentrate of it

285
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
that smelled like mushrooms and swiss

286
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,519
cheese it absolutely did

287
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,759
but that is not why that name came about

288
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,080
so i want to dispel that myth that rumor

289
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,319
i want to put skunk masters real story

290
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
out there he called it gmo because it's

291
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
got girl scout cookies in it

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
it smells like chemicals and the girl

293
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
scouts were under scrutiny

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
for being discovered that their product

295
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
was laden with gmo so that's where the

296
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,720
gmo

297
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
name came from let's talk more about the

298
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
plant a little bit now

299
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,439
the plant grows really tall and lanky it

300
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
is kind of a problematic plant it is a

301
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
pain in the ass of a plant

302
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,799
it would not do it will work in a

303
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
commercial environment but it is not

304
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,039
going to be the one that makes the boss

305
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
happy

306
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,399
and it's not going to be the one that

307
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,120
gets the grower a bonus check

308
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,159
it does make big giant buds but it grows

309
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
very slowly

310
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,278
it's kind of lanky it's kind of stretchy

311
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,439
and it has

312
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,278
issues it likes to get calm ag deficient

313
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
it's got some other problems to it

314
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,078
it's kind of a finicky little [ __ ] if

315
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,519
you don't feed it right it doesn't give

316
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,120
you what you can get

317
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,120
so i took the gmo female

318
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
and of course i pollinated that with

319
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,240
king solomon what was my goal

320
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
my goal was to get those garlic turps i

321
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,278
love that

322
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,440
savory it's like mashed potatoes and

323
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,200
with garlic garlic mashed potatoes or

324
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
it's almost like you're dabbing or

325
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,560
smoking a savory thanksgiving meal

326
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,360
i wanted that garlic terp but i wanted a

327
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,599
better

328
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
flower a better plant structure and a

329
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
shorter flowering time

330
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
the gmo takes a little bit too long to

331
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,199
flower the buds aren't very big

332
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
it's super potent and super tasty and

333
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,839
it's very effective but it could be

334
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
better so my goal was just to improve it

335
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
keep that terp

336
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,159
but improve on that lanky shitty

337
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
structure and improve on the flowering

338
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,519
time and also

339
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
improve on the harvest weight because it

340
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,200
does not put out big fat buds

341
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,079
so of course i pollinated the gmo

342
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
with king solomon and now we've got dark

343
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,799
hollow

344
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,639
um i'm going to skip a few things and i

345
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,838
want to tell you why i call it dark

346
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,919
hollow

347
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,519
dark hollow of course is a grateful dead

348
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,559
song it's one of my favorite grateful

349
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,879
dead songs

350
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,719
one of my favorite versions is off of

351
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,559
bear's choice best of the grateful dead

352
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
volume two it's an acoustic version i

353
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,439
know that's a lot of weird info you

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,039
probably don't care about

355
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
maybe you do if you're interested in

356
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
that i want you to be able to find it

357
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,000
dark hollow by the grateful dead another

358
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
really good version

359
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
of that song is on reckoning another

360
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,599
live album they put out

361
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,879
anyway that's where the name came from

362
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,159
dark hollow

363
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,519
um it makes big dark leaves there's a

364
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
phenotype that will make

365
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,679
nearly black purple leaves and they

366
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,439
start to get this weird velvety texture

367
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,838
toward the end when you start flushing

368
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
so the dark colored leaves it had that

369
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,920
dark flavor to it

370
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
savory flavors dark hollow it stuck for

371
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,240
me

372
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,159
i am going to do a full episode on how i

373
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
name strains but right now i just want

374
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,639
to give you an idea

375
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,159
the grateful dead song the grateful dead

376
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,278
means a lot to me i love their music

377
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
they just feel good

378
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,720
so dark hollow the song name the leaf

379
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,559
color

380
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,000
it all worked out for us with the flavor

381
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,039
that's how he got the name it makes

382
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,440
big fat dark color leaves dark hollow

383
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,319
so um let's talk about some of the

384
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,240
aromas

385
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
and flavors that you will get from dark

386
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,399
hollow i keep saying garlic

387
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,680
the garlic aromas come through very well

388
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
there are also hints of rubber like car

389
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,799
tires

390
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
there are also hints of if you've ever

391
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,039
popped open

392
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,639
a fresh jar of tennis balls that's kind

393
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,278
of what it smells like fresh tennis

394
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,159
balls

395
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,679
or sometimes it smells like new shoes if

396
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,360
you ever get a brand new pair of nikes

397
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,120
and you open up the nikes that

398
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
leather and rubber smell kind of comes

399
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,919
out it sort of got that sort of a smell

400
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,039
to it

401
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,759
it's also got uh gassy aromas there are

402
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,480
gassy

403
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,000
gassy aromas in some of these phenotypes

404
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,360
there is one phenotype

405
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,799
that makes a disgustingly amazing

406
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
sour vomit aroma and i love it i cannot

407
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,519
get enough of that phenotype i know that

408
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
sounds terrible

409
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,600
but it's like that's gross oh i love it

410
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,600
that's so gross let me smell it again

411
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
it's just so disgustingly pleasant that

412
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,480
i cannot stop smelling it so

413
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
it's real savory uh i say bottom end

414
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
lower sort of notes of smells not the

415
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,039
high sharper stuff

416
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,680
lower stuff real savory uh garlic gas

417
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,958
rubber tires uh stabby says it smells

418
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,719
like leather boots

419
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,399
so i will agree with that because of the

420
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
shoe factor it kind of smells like a

421
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
pair of fresh

422
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
leather nikes it's got that rubber got

423
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
the leather like you just opened up a

424
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,679
fresh pair of jordans or you're walking

425
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,159
through the nike store

426
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,958
kind of does have that sort of aroma now

427
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,078
let's talk about

428
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:47,679
the buzz i call dark hollow

429
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,159
deep thinking weed most of what i breed

430
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,120
uh

431
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,039
puts me uh i purposefully love to smoke

432
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,720
myself and do a panic attack i want to

433
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,000
smoke right at the edge where i'm like i

434
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
don't know what's going on man

435
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,919
i want to smoke right to giggles right

436
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,039
to that point

437
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,919
the dark hollow i can smoke myself

438
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,759
into the couch i usually don't breed

439
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,639
things that make me go into the couch

440
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,519
this one i can turn off my entire body

441
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
and go numb

442
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
i can get into a little bubble and i can

443
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
just think

444
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,919
and i just end up in a it's meditation

445
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
weed you're just

446
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,519
nothing's going on around you you could

447
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,120
you could burn down the entire house

448
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
you can move all the furniture out as

449
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
you as long as you don't touch the couch

450
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
i'm sitting on i'll never notice

451
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,680
if i've smoked enough dark hollow it

452
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,919
puts you in this little puts me

453
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,359
in this little just a bubble i call it

454
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,639
thinker wheat or bubble weed or

455
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,079
meditation weed

456
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,240
or it just feels like you're just

457
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,559
isolated in a good way it's not a scary

458
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,799
way

459
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,078
it just shuts everything off around you

460
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,879
so if you're one of those people that

461
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,039
has a hard time

462
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,120
shutting things down this may be good

463
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,120
weed for you if you need to go to class

464
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,560
and kind of be able to just shut

465
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
everything off and pay attention to the

466
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,879
professor and just take notes and learn

467
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,559
this may be the [ __ ] for you it's not

468
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,320
multi-task weed it's not

469
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,599
[ __ ] do the dishes and listen to

470
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,839

it tastes real good it's got a real nice

474
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,799
buzz to it now let's talk about this is

00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,078
a grow podcast so let's talk a little

476
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,159

dark hollow that's my favorite part is

478
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,879
growing i don't know that's a tough

479
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,519
choice do i prefer to grow it or smoke

480
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,039
it

481
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480

down that path uh you tell me if you had

486
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,159
to make a decision you can either grow

487
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,440
weed or smoke weed for the rest of your

488

in most of my strain descriptions but

495
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,198
these plants will get

496
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,480
tall they're going to get tall on you

497
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,159
uh the gmo plant is known for being very

498

tall it's got that chem dog kind of a

499

it gets real long and lacy it'll it'll

502
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,000
grow rope vines on you if you let it so

503
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,838
you've got to keep

504
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,078
it a lot of light to keep it nice and

505
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
compact i do a lot of cracking of the

506
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,359
stems

507
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
i talk about popping stems a lot i grab

508
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
the stem with a couple of fingers in one

509
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
spot a couple of fingers on my thumb

510
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,319
i grab right above it with a couple of

511
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
fingers on my thumb and i simply twist

512
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
in different directions until you hear a

513
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,800
little pop

514
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,480
just a little snapping sound you have

515
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,198
now broken the cellulose structure of

516
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,039
the plant

517
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,319
instead of that plant growing vertically

518
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,000
straight up it's going to send some

519
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
energy to healing that broken part of

520
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
the plant

521
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,079
it won't get taller it will get thicker

522
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,039
we like them nice and thick we want them

523
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,479
nice and wide

524
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,039
so go ahead and crack those stems

525
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
because they're going to get very tall

526
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,639
there will also be plenty of distance

527
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
between your nodes

528
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,879
for some reason this cross likes to put

529
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,159
some distance between the nodes if you

530
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,759
give it plenty of light

531
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,519
you'll minimize that but it will get

532
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,480
some space between the nodes

533
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
that does allow a lot of very easy

534
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
trellis work if you're a person that

535
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,039
does trellising

536
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,639
this plant will weave into the trellis

537
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,919
very easily because of those long

538
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
branches

539
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,039
let me keep myself on track talking more

540
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,879
about the growing

541
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,480
uh it's going to get tall it will do the

542
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,559
21 day stretch on you

543
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
it is probably going to get really tall

544
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,480
during that then the stretch

545
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,838
slows down and all that part where it's

546
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
stretched fills in with

547
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,599
big fat thick chunky buds uh this will

548
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
make

549
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,519
just giant chunky colas the whole way

550
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
through but it looks like you're gonna

551
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,720
get big stretchy plants at first just

552
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
give them time to fill in

553
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
and like i keep saying it wants a lot of

554
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,159
light

555
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
a lot of light these plants really seem

556
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,120
to like a lot of light

557
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,399
so you're going to get some big leaves

558
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,199
on some of these plants

559
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
you may get some big giant black leaves

560
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
big giant bright green leaves

561
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,479
big giant purple leaves later in the

562
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,720
flowering phase

563
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
they may start to turn like a champagne

564
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,880
pink sort of a color as they fade out

565
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,839
that is a good thing there is no problem

566
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,080
there that's what you want

567
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:51,439
also some of the larger leaf

568
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,319
phenotypes may be droopy that is not a

569
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,279
problem

570
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,839
the daybreaker grandparent on the arise

571
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,200
side

572
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,879
had very large leaves sometimes that

573
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
male would droop

574
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
he wasn't thirsty he hadn't met his dli

575
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,320
he just had such

576
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,839
big leaves that sometimes they would

577
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,879
just hang down like he was like bro

578
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,720
these leaves are huge

579
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,919
i'm not holding them up all day i'm just

580
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
going to kind of let them droop a little

581
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,799
bit

582
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
if you see these plants drooping a

583
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,798
little bit and you know that your water

584
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,440
is fine you know that your dli is up to

585
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,079
speed

586
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,160
don't stress that is a trait of these

587
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,759
plants that comes from the daybreaker

588
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
grandparent i think it comes from the

589
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,679
joseph

590
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,600
og grandpa to tell you the truth so

591
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
if you see some droopy leaves and you

592
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,759
know you have watered

593
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
that is okay uh you may see some really

594
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,200
long

595
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,519
pedials um the leaves will stick really

596
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
far

597
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,798
off of the plant that is okay many

598
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,159
people think that's a problem

599
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,319
that is a trait coming from the

600
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,880
daybreaker also the girl scout cookies

601
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,439
so long pedials is to be expected

602
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,200
purple pedials are not a problem you may

603
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,120
see some purpling in this plant

604
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
it's not a nutrient deficiency that is

605
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,558
not a cold issue

606
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
that is what this plant does it will

607
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,000
make colors like that

608
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,919
so you're gonna see long purple pedials

609
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,798
and big colorful leaves

610
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
you're gonna get long branching a lot of

611
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,160
long

612
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,079
long branching not many side shoots but

613
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
really long branches it's going to grow

614
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,038
kind of like

615
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,000
og kush you guys if you're familiar with

616
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,079
growing og

617
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,839
it just gets long and switchy but then

618
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,599
once you put it into flour that long

619
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,558
switchy [ __ ] will fill in with nothing

620
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,038
but colas

621
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,720
so be ready for kind of stretchy long

622
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,558
pain in the ass plants this is not going

623
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,919
to be the easiest plant to grow but in

624
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,240
the end it will be well worth

625
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
all of the work i keep saying it grows

626
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,640
kind of like og

627
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,279
kush anyone who's familiar with og knows

628
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
that these plants will need extra cow

629
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,480
mag

630
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,599
cookies often needs more calmag og needs

631
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,160
more calmag

632
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,959
be on top of the calmag for this plant

633
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,558
if you see

634
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
the little spots forming in the middle

635
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,079
of the leaves that is probably unless

636
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,759
it's spider mites pay attention

637
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,839
that is probably your earliest sign of

638
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,119
calmag calmag is going to be

639
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,000
the most common deficiency with these

640
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,199
plants

641
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,319
uh they're going to get tall they're

642
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
going to get kind of stretchy they're

643
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,918
going to double in size

644
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,119
you will need supports you will need

645
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,919
some sort of sticks

646
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,439
tomato cages or trellises i like to grow

647
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,280
these plants with sticks a lot of the

648
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
times i do trellis and tomato cages i

649
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,119
prefer sticks with these plants because

650
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,759
of the way they grow

651
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,678
top it one time you'll get four big tops

652
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,079
use those four big tops put sticks in

653
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,679
there

654
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,359
then you can kind of put them in the

655
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,038
room real close together

656
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,558
that's the way i do it with this plant i

657
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,599
don't do the cages

658
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,359
with the dark hollow i prefer sticks

659
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,519
if you're going to trellis trellis early

660
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,158
because it does get stiff and woody i've

661
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,000
noticed that

662
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,240
these phenotypes something in the

663
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
genetics it tends to get stiff and hard

664
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,839
toward the end of life it won't be

665
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,480
really easy to work so

666
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,038
um my i wrote it again calmac i must

667
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
really

668
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,038
mean calmag these plants are gonna want

669
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
extra calmag you're going to notice a

670
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,519
couple

671
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:01,280
of different very distinct phenotypes

672
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,038
there will be a black leafed phenotype

673
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,960
the black leaf phenotype you'll notice

674
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,640
it early in flower about week four or

675
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,480
five it'll start turning darker on you

676
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
the pedials will get black

677
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,519
the black leafed phenotype has a

678
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
tendency

679
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,158
to look angry later in flower this is a

680
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,000
trait from the girl scout cookies late

681
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,799
in flower the leaves will go really dark

682
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
in color

683
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,480
and maybe they'll just start doing weird

684
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
claw shapes or the leaves will start

685
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,679
doing weird [ __ ] to you

686
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,279
that is a trait from the girl scout

687
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,280
cookies and it just happens

688
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,279
i cannot keep that plant happy all the

689
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,079
way to the end no matter what i have

690
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,240
done

691
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,199
i've noticed the blacker leafed

692
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,798
phenotype

693
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,558
prefers lower ph and cooler temps

694
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,960
so if you've got that dark colored

695
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,200
phenotype lower your temperatures

696
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,480
lower your ph it may make that plant a

697
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,840
little bit happier

698
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,279
if you have got the green leaf dominant

699
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,439
phenotype and you'll be able to tell you

700
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,038
guys this plant makes really dark

701
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,279
and really light phenotypes and it

702
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,000
indicates early that lighter

703
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,038
green colored phenotype is going to like

704
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,599
your standard

705
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,359
temperatures and your standard ph uh

706
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,158
when i say standard i'm talking like

707
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,959
77 to 82 84 whatever you guys are doing

708
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,600
in the grow

709
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
and your standard ph like five nine to

710
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,359
six four or whatever

711
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,600
but when it comes to the darker leaf

712
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,439
phenotype you're gonna wanna get like 72

713
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,519
74 degrees it can take a little bit

714
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,480
colder it can certainly take a colder

715
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,158
night temperature

716
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
and you want to drop that ph down to

717
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
like six six two and stay

718
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
there with the dark leaf phenotype of

719
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,678
course i'm giving you advice based on my

720
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,038
experience

721
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,038
your room your nutrients your equipment

722
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,440
your plants everything is going to have

723
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,079
a variable your style will play a factor

724
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
into this

725
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,480
so anything i say is from my experience

726
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
what i've seen through testers

727
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
what i've seen in my rooms your

728
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,720
experience may vary

729
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
listen to the plants the plants are the

730
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
boss

731
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,798
you may want to give them more calmac

732
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,519
you may have a schedule that says

733
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,119
this is going to happen who cares if the

734
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,200
plants say don't do this

735
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,279
don't do that if the plants say please

736
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,440
do this please do that

737
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,599
we need to be we need to have a good

738
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,200
strategy we need to be in control

739
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,519
but we also need to be open to

740
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
suggestions from the plants the plants

741
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,119
are the boss our goal is to make

742
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
quality product in the end and if we

743
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,639
don't pay attention to the plants you

744
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,360
don't have quality product in the end so

745
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,000
take everything i say very seriously but

746
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,319
also know

747
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,359
that your room your plants your

748
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,960
phenotypes

749
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,038
everything are going to play a factor

750
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
and you may have different experiences

751
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,558
so pay attention to the plants but from

752
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
what i've noticed

753
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,319
those green the bright green phenotypes

754
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,038
like a little higher temp

755
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,038
and a little a higher ph of course the

756
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:41,839
darker colored plants like the cooler

757
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,200
temperature

758
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,480
and the lowered ph uh what else can we

759
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,558
talk about i've got a few

760
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,839
few more notes here oh harvest times the

761
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:57,119
darker colored plants they will take

762
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,319
less time than the bright green colored

763
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,798
plants i say that the dark hollow

764
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,798
takes somewhere between 9 and 11 weeks i

765
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,278
mostly say 9 to 10 weeks there will be

766
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,480
outliers you'll find an 8 week phenotype

767
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,038
you may find one that grows really black

768
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,159
leaves really wide black leaves with

769
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,720
purple pedials

770
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,039
and it makes really dark buds that is

771
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
almost a copy of the girl scout cookies

772
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,679
that one finishes in the end of week

773
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,719
eight

774
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,278
56 55 days she's ready to chop down and

775
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
smoke

776
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,038
she's ready to go so you may find that

777
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
eight week phenotype

778
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,079
the nine week phenotype is a beautiful

779
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
combination

780
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,079
it's got that cookies aroma and flavor

781
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,080
and funk and stank

782
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,000
it's also got the garlic in there it's

783
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,918
got just enough darkness to give it some

784
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,759
really beautiful colors on the buds

785
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,080
and it doesn't take 10 or 11 weeks to

786
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,400
finish you'll find another phenotype in

787
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,119
there

788
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
that is very bright green i think this

789
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,079
one

790
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,439
is kind of it's more like the 50 50 mix

791
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,839
it's got the arise in there

792
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,519
it's got the the gmo in there it's got a

793
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,639
sweet garlicky thing to it

794
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,639
but that one's going to take you a

795
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
little bit longer to flower

796
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
so we've got our girl scout cookies

797
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,278
dominant phenotype

798
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,879
we've got the one that i think is kind

799
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,480
of a 50 50. that one's going to take

800
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
about 10 and a half weeks of flower

801
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
probably

802
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,278
then we've got our the dark hollow that

803
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,760
it looked like

804
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,400
token nailed this phenotype you can see

805
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,400
it was

806
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,759
bright green but right where the leaves

807
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,519
are sticking out of the buds they were

808
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,200
starting to turn purple you can see

809
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,798
the sugar leaves were turning purple as

810
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,038
they were coming out of the buds

811
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,119
i think he took that one nine weeks and

812
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,879
it looks perfect you guys it looks like

813
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,239
a giant menorah of buds

814
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,320
when he hung it upside down it was

815
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,278
nothing but bud from the base

816
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,720
all the way to the tip big fat chunky

817
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,480
buds and i'm pretty sure he took that

818
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,519
one nine full weeks big shout out to

819
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
jrtoken

820
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,759
you can see his photos on cano buzz uh

821
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,278
shameless plug for cannabis it's a

822
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,278
cannabis friendly social media

823
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,200
application uh where you can post your

824
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,679
cannabis photography

825
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,640
check out cannabis on your iphone or

826
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,840
your android

827
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,440
device i'm going to take a sip here and

828
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,439
get my voice and myself back on track

829
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,879
all right so we've got a few distinct

830
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,558
phenotypes to look for we've got the

831
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
girl scout cookies looking phenotype

832
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,319
that wraps up around week eight

833
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
we've got that sort of 50 50 looking

834
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,319
phenotype that's going to take a little

835
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,400
bit longer 10 and a half maybe 11 weeks

836
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,359
then we've got that beautiful phenotype

837
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
that gets dark

838
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,399
it makes purple leaves it grows really

839
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,319
big

840
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
big fat chunky colas it smells like

841
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,079
garlic and sweetness and a little bit of

842
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
gas and some dirty feet

843
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,918
that is your nine-week phenotype that's

844
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,558
the one you were looking for

845
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,159
you'll start seeing the greener buds

846
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,519
start making purple leaves around the

847
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
edges when you flush it

848
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,960
those purple leaves start turning gold

849
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,599
that is a beautiful

850
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,919
phenotype i really love that one i want

851
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,639
to talk about some of the aromas

852
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,840
the phenotype that smells like rubber

853
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
early on

854
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,759
turns to gas once you dry and cure it

855
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
that's what i have noticed

856
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,038
the rubbery tennis balls fresh nikes

857
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,919
when you cut that one down trim it dry

858
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,798
it and cure it

859
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
it tends to turn very garlic that is

860
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,759
when the garlic

861
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,119
appears as later in the dry and cure and

862
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,879
then when you extract that

863
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,399
if you make a squish that's when the

864
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
garlic really

865
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,000
really comes out of that one there is a

866
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,120
phenotype

867
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,440
that smells sour it's got a gross

868
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,119
sour smell to it i think it's a longer

869
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,880
flowering phenotype

870
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,798
this one i didn't find this phenotype

871
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,278
this one was presented to me

872
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,038
it smelled sour and gross this is the

873
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,278
one that i kind of say smells like a bar

874
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,679
trash can or a little bit of vomit

875
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,798
it had when i smoked a bowl of this one

876
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
it had the most

877
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,119
intense eye buzz um

878
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,119
i don't know how else to explain it

879
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,839
other than my eyes got really heavy and

880
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,879
kind of vibratey and bloodshot red

881
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,079
it went straight to my eyes so if you

882
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,039
get the phenotype

883
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,720
that smells acrid and sour and has a

884
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,440
little bit skinny or longer

885
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,839
super serrated leaf that one is going to

886
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,798
be

887
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,918
a crazy high buzzer it was really

888
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,440
intense on the eyes

889
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,360
straight to the head i felt like i just

890
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
wanted to stare at the floor i was so

891
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,158
high i felt like my eyes

892
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,600
wanted to water um a couple more notes

893
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,278
that i've said

894
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,959
leaf droop i've talked about the leaf

895
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,640
droop i don't want you guys to freak out

896
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
when the leaves get droopy that is a

897
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
trait that comes

898
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,599
from the daybreaker male i've said this

899
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,839
before a lot of the crosses

900
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,519
more of the indica dominant stuff that

901
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,839
comes from the daybreaker

902
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,359
will get these droopy leaves it is not a

903
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,879
problem with your plants it's not a

904
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,719
problem with the room it's not a problem

905
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
with the water it's not your fault

906
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,200
that's what these plants do pay

907
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,359
attention make sure she's not too dry

908
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
as long as it's not too dry that's just

909
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,879
what the plant does

910
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,558
also when the plants have reached their

911
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,200
dli when they've had enough light for

912
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,440
the day

913
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,038
they will droop just to show you i've

914
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,038
had enough light i'm not gonna photo

915
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,720
photosynthesize anymore today i'm gonna

916
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,000
take a little break just like a person

917
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,120
when they've done their work for the day

918
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,839
and they're done they just go lean

919
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,439
against the wall

920
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,038
your plant is leaning against the wall

921
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
just put its hat in its face it's taking

922
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,398
a little break

923
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,398
uh purple stems i don't want you guys to

924
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,678
freak out if you see purple stems that

925
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,599
is not a problem

926
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,880
with these plants sometimes you're going

927
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,839
to get purple stems

928
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,840
that is a good thing

929
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,158
you may see purple pedials you may see

930
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,720
straight up purple

931
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,000
branches you may get purple stems that

932
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
is not a problem

933
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,319
those plants will turn into the black

934
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,000
phenotypes the darker leaved phenotypes

935
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,439
they'll smell gassy and garlicky and

936
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
delicious you'll have that girl scout

937
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
cookies dominance in there

938
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,000
i think that those will be great plants

939
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,200
for you

940
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,759
uh let's see there's one i said it

941
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,240
smells

942
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,919
like a problem there's one that smells

943
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,960
like something's wrong

944
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,240
if you've ever left a pot of soil

945
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,679
in water too long and it got sort of uh

946
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,759
it's almost crappy it's moldy it's funky

947
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,440
it's like dirty water uh it almost

948
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,119
smells like it needs to be flushed or

949
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,080
wiped it's got a really bad

950
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,359
sour disgusting smell to it uh that's

951
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,599
not a problem

952
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,678
with that plant that's just an aroma

953
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:05,759
that one of the phenotypes make

954
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,559
so one of the grandparents is joseph og

955
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,720
or it's uh it's josephogee and kim d

956
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,398
makes the daybreaker and i think the

957
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,440
joseph og in there

958
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,359
is what is giving us that funky

959
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,038
it's it's really gross it makes my nose

960
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,759
go oh it makes my whole body go

961
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,798
oh but it smells terrible when it's

962
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,558
growing it smells

963
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,200
anaerobic it smells like you've got some

964
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,278
sort of anaerobic fungus going on

965
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
and i have never found a problem in the

966
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,038
pot i've never found a problem with that

967
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
plant none of the other pots or anything

968
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,240
had an issue

969
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,440
but this one plant just made this

970
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,558
terrible

971
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,000
barfy [ __ ] disgusting aroma

972
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,678
and then when you dry it and cure it and

973
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
smoke it it is so

974
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,320
dank you can smell it down the block

975
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,320
it's like uh garlicky dirty feet

976
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,359
but when it's growing if it smells like

977
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,240
it's disgusting

978
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,918
don't don't be worried uh i don't think

979
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,319

981
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,519
you could it smelled like there was

982
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,399
something dead in the pot it smelled

983
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,319
like a mouse

984
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,439
climbed into the pot dug a little hole

985
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,798
and died in there

986
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,640
and that's what we were smelling but it

987
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,759

00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,599
right ladies and gentlemen i think that

1002
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,559
wraps up

1003
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,599
my uh notes that i took for the review

1004
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,759
on the strain

1005
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,278
dark hollow there are phenotypes that

1006
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,278
will finish up in eight weeks there's a

1007
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,278
good phenotype that wraps up at nine

1008
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,880
you'll find some that take ten i know

1009
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,440
there are a couple phenotypes that go

1010
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,960
longer

1011
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,640
you'll be able to tell them by their

1012
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,038
skinnier skinnier

1013
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,840
leaves the more desirable phenotypes in

1014
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,079
my opinion

1015
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,278
have wider leaves the skinnier leaf

1016
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,639
phenotype you get

1017
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,480
start getting more told toward the

1018
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,399
golden goat i've got plenty of other

1019
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,079
offerings that give you that golden goat

1020
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,319
dominant flavor and style

1021
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,158
so i really look for the wider leaved

1022
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,200
phenotypes when it comes to dark hollow

1023
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
that's where you're going to get those

1024
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,480
garlicky

1025
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,519
more savory aromas it's going to go

1026
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,278
sweeter

1027
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,038
the taller the plant the skinnier the

1028
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,640
leaf i feel like the sweeter

1029
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,240
and the more tropical flavors you're

1030
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,038
going to get so i like those

1031
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,558
broader leaves i like the dark colors i

1032
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,038
really like the pukey

1033
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,960
uh crappy gross kind of smelling

1034
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,759
phenotypes early on

1035
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
um feeding it give it calmag it will go

1036
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,960
macro deficient early

1037
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,558
make sure you give it calmac if you

1038
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,278
start seeing issues early on it is

1039
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,119
probably

1040
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,319
calmag if you see those leaves curling

1041
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,278
up and twisting up

1042
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,319
that's just something that the

1043
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,359
phenotypes do sometimes they look like

1044
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,960
[ __ ] by the end

1045
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,639
but they really harvest well and they

1046
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,558
taste amazing and smoke well

1047
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,840
so just treat them the best you can
