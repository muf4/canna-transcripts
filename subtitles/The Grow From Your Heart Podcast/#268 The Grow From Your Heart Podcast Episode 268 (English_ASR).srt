Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes Jay and

44
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,219
Silent Bob get old a recording of a live

45
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,140
podcast here in Pueblo that's right

46
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,579
Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes came to

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,500
Pueblo Colorado they did a live

48
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,000
recording of their podcast at a place

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,489
called Memorial Hall which is right

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,899
downtown in Pueblo first of all I'm

51
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,879
[ __ ] surprised I've never been to a

52
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,790
show at Memorial Hall because the place

53
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,399
is super cool it's real tiny it's uh

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,110
there we are right up front so it seemed

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,599
real tiny to me it's kind of it it's a

56
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,129
smaller sized venue one thing I did

57
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,629
notice that tickets for every show are

58
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,819
quite overpriced you can see the same

59
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,049
show for cheaper somewhere else but it's

60
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,639
a really tiny place it's kind of a cool

61
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,829
place I'm amazed I've never been their

62
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,449
first show but Kevin Smith and Jason

63
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,849
Mewes of course Jay and Silent Bob from

64
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,379
all the Jay and Silent Bob movies Kevin

65
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,819
Smith is director of quite a few movies

66
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,019
he directed Mallrats clerks chasing amy

67
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,699
what's the other one tusks they make fun

68
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,519

69
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,750

74
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,890

75
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,780
hey Mike thanks for taking me bro I

76
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,250
laughed my ass off I ate a lot of

77
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,840
edibles before I went and I took a

78
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,699
gigantic dab right before the show

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,799
turned like a couple of my friends like

80
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,208
you okay bro I'm just high as [ __ ] I

81
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,920
don't have anything to [ __ ] say

82
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,750
people were trying to talk to me and I

83
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,089
just couldn't think it and there were no

84
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,919
words there were not words for my head

85
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,840
at the time he just wasn't [ __ ] for me

86
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,000
to say

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,920
I just stayed silent most of the time so

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,300
that was my Friday night Friday night a

89
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,799
zipped home from work kind of cleaned up

90
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,680
a little bit man windsock Kevin Smith

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,629
and then Saturday what did I do Saturday

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
hung out a little bit I bet some

93
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:22,548
gardening did some stuff like that and

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,560
then went up to Colorado Springs and saw

95
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,930
Harry mow and the Colorado reggae unit

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,848
featuring miss Jenny Beth on vocals and

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,099
quite a few other amazing reggae artists

98
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:33,439
I watch them play one set danced around

99
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:35,179
there weren't many people dancing and so

100
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,560
I thought watch this I let my dreadlocks

101
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,760
down and I went standing in the middle

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,019
of the dance the wind stood in the

103
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,669
middle what did I just say wouldn't

104
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,769
stood it I think I said I went standed

105
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,208
god damn I'm high I went stood in the

106
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,039
middle of the dance floor I don't know

107
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,949
how to dance you guys I'm six foot five

108
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,150
and I'm lanky and I'm goofy but I just

109
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,859
left my dreadlocks down and just wiggle

110
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,930
around like a [ __ ] white hippy and

111
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,790
just shake my dreadlocks around to the

112
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,989
reggae music and the reggae band was

113
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,609
smiling at me like I know what you're

114
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,900
doing and then suddenly all the people

115
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,040
were dancing it was a good ass time you

116
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,519
just got to break the ice he just got to

117
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,109
dance but then for the second set we ate

118
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,340
some food during the set break there's a

119
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,200
little break there for the musicians to

120
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,090
take a rest played for about an hour and

121
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,318
then they took a break and then I was

122
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,789
eating some food finishing up some of

123
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,519
JB's free meal she gets from being in

124
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,418
the band and uh they yelled Rasta Jeff

125
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,949
we need you to come up here and play

126
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,509
djembe so they invited me up on stage

127
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,029
again to go play djembe with them it's

128
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:25,159
always fun to join the reggae band bunch

129
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,019
of really good reggae musicians they're

130
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,580
all I think all of them are probably

131
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,168
older than myself and I really like

132
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,598
playing with older musicians there's

133
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:34,909
less ego there's a better tempo it's

134
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:36,469
more musical nothing to get stealing

135
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,970
musicians but the older cats have

136
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,050
something especially in reggae music you

137
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,910
just need a rhythm section

138
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,199
they just lays back and plays rhythm you

139
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,970
don't need a whole bunch of fancy [ __ ]

140
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,279
and these guys are older cats and they

141
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,010
nail it so shot a two Jenny Beth

142
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:52,819
Harry Moe and the entire Colorado reggae

143
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:54,918
unit alright let's turn down this music

144
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,569
because I'm still dad the [ __ ] out from

145
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,250
I took two dads at that Tahoe the first

146
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,538
one I was like that wasn't enough so I

147
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,579
went in a little harder on the second

148
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:03,079
one and my whole body went numb I got

149
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:05,180
goose bumps and my arm hair moved around

150
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,019
it was [ __ ] awesome I could feel my

151
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,418
eyes all droopy

152
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,788
I hope I'm not doing a terrible podcast

153
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:13,098
all right guys let's talk about my most

154
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:15,079
uh my newest breeding project my newest

155
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,310
and most recent breeding project I'm

156
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,500
always talking about breeding stuff

157
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,120
right so my current breeding project I

158
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,680

159

161
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,889
breaker I am using King Solomon I found

162
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,269
an amazing male I've talked about it a

163
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,180
lot I probably went through somewhere

164
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:33,099
between 250 and 500 seeds of the arise

165
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,050
cross to find the male that I wanted

166
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,000
I've got the stud that I want I named

167
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,610
him King Solomon he's in a room right

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,240
now he is getting ready to pollinate

169
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,009
amongst many other several other sexy

170
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,319
ladies he is going to pollinate for the

171
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,569
first time cactus cooler for the first

172
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,599
time he will pollinate durbin poison and

173
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,939
he will also pollinate a star dog female

174
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,919
so there will be cactus cooler durbin

175
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,288
poison and star dog all crossed to the

176
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,359
arise in the near future that's

177
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:03,788
something I am really excited about I'm

178
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,580
super excited about the star dog because

179
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:08,110
I start out to arise that's gonna start

180
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:10,060
hogs already a great producer it's

181
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,770
already resinous I think it's gonna put

182
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,870
more of a funk to the flavor and it

183
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:16,448
should increase trichomes and it should

184
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,300
increase production the Durbin poison

185
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:21,819
cross I'm hoping that that brings out

186
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,978
some of that anise and licorice and that

187
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,719
funky flavor from the Durbin poison into

188
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:27,639
the sweetness and the funkiness of the

189
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,139
arize I think that'll be a very great

190
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,478
cross now that I'm thinking about it

191
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,710
it's gonna be I have an idea of what its

192
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,909
gonna be similar to I don't know if I

193
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,138
want to say it out loud I want to let

194
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,570
other people smoke it and see if they

195
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,478
see it also when it's done cactus school

196
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,978
or to arise cactus cooler tastes like

197
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,870
pineapples and oranges and sweetness and

198
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:45,639
I'm hoping to bring that out in the

199
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,620
arize cactus cooler is already a huge

200
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,150
growing plant so this should be a very

201
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,348
interesting cross this might be

202
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,079
something that may be a hit for the

203
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:54,639
outdoor grow season I'm sure that I'll

204
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,310
get several phenotypes that at least

205
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,629
have that orange e citrusy pineapple e

206
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,860
kind of taste to it and that's what I'm

207
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,899
looking for I want to breed with that a

208
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,220
little bit so those are some of the

209
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,569
things that are coming up in my newest

210
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,699
breeding project I like to keep you guys

211
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,228
updated there are of course some of the

212
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,520
classics the classic females are in

213
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,139
there the Grateful dog is in there to

214
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,459
make morning dew white widow is in there

215
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,900
to make storm shadow

216
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,909
cookies and cream is in there to make

217
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:17,739
the cream there are a couple others in

218
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,000
there also so we're gonna restock some

219
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,560
of the old stuff and create some new

220
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,240
stuff at the same time of course there's

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,759
a couple of a rises in there so we can

222
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,348
make some more rise but everything in

223
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,728
that room there's a purpose for that's

224
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:30,370
kind of what I was getting at by talking

225
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:31,968
about my breeding project everything in

226
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,478
there I've got a goal and a

227
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:37,639
and why I'm making it and I'm also going

228
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,558
to start using a new male in the future

229
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,179
so I'm crossing a bunch of the older

230
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,919
stuff to have a nice stockpile of some

231
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:45,078
of that and making some new stuff at the

232
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,628
same time some of the stuff will be made

233
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,429
in 2f twos the arise that are being made

234
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,039
in this room right now will be F twos

235
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:54,468
there's some new ideas in there also

236
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,838
when January comes they're changing the

237
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:58,218
limits in Colorado so my rules will be

238
00:07:56,838 --> 00:08:00,678
different to the amounts of plants that

239
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:02,629
I can have will be different so my idea

240
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:05,178
for breeding instead of having a large

241
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:08,569
amount of females and one male I will be

242
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:10,248
using probably two males and a smaller

243
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,110
amount of females that way I can keep my

244
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,909
plant counts legal and be safe and keep

245
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,619
myself protected under all the Colorado

246
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:16,668
laws that's what I need to do that's one

247
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,379
of the most important things that I have

248
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:20,359
to do is make sure I'm legal and

249
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,649
protected and safe so now that they're

250
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,299
tightening all the numbers here in

251
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,829
Colorado my breeding will become much

252
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:26,418
more focused I'll have to think it

253
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,478
through a little bit more I have to use

254
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:32,059
less space less plants but it challenges

255
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,889
me a little more but you know what we

256
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,750
used to grow when it was completely

257
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,698
illegal so giving me rules and making me

258
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,188
work with rules and dance around those

259
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:42,620
rules I will follow them I'll stay

260
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:44,149
completely legal and I'll still do well

261
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,620
because I love a good challenge it's

262
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,419
kind of cheating now because you know

263
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,100
like we can have all you could buy all

264
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,360
the gear you could do it legally back in

265
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,800
the day you couldn't even have the gear

266
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,089
you'd get in trouble for having a grow

267
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,620
light now you can have the [ __ ] and grow

268
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,759
as long as you're not growing too much

269
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,860
so as long as they're gonna let me grow

270
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,568
a certain amount I'll do it I like the

271
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,639
challenge I like they're making me think

272
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:03,289
a little more it sounds fun I'm ready

273
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,308
let's do it but anyway my breeding

274
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,808
projects are gonna tighten up a little

275
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,068
bit you're gonna see a little bit of

276
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:08,600
different stuff coming from me pretty

277
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:10,698
soon you're gonna see a different male

278
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,769
enter the scene pretty soon there's

279
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:14,448
actually a feminized project coming up I

280
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,799
haven't done much feminized stuff no it

281
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:18,139
will not be the grateful dog it will be

282
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,139
something brand new but we'll talk about

283
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,610
that when that time comes anyway I feel

284
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:24,409
like the main topic of this show may

285
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,360
take a little bit of time so we should

286
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,009
work our way into it did I cover all the

287
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,688
opening stuff I think we did if not

288
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,240
we'll talk about it next time let's talk

289
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:33,919
about the main topic of the show I was

290
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,509
on Instagram life if you don't follow me

291
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,938
on Instagram you should follow me on

292
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,068
Instagram it's I read genetics Irie

293
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:43,730
underscore genetics IR ie

294
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:45,789
underscore GE and et ICS follow me on

295
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,940
Instagram you can check out my Instagram

296
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:51,099
live videos in my Instagram live videos

297
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,570
I let people ask random questions and

298
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,340
then I try to answer them to the best of

299
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,220
my ability with no preparation with no

300
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,240
notes just off the top of my head I try

301
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,970
to give them the best advice and

302
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,470
guidance I can and we have a lot of fun

303
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,330
times talking sometimes we take a bunch

304
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,830
of dabs or I take a bunch of dabs I

305
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,360
don't know what everybody else does but

306
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,340
I take tabs I eat edibles and hang out

307
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,310
but somebody on one of my Instagram live

308
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,200
videos asked me to talk about what f1

309
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,449
means and what IBL means and all that

310
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,220
type of stuff so I did give a brief

311
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,710
explanation there on Instagram live but

312
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,840
I feel like it would be a great podcast

313
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,220
episode so I took a few notes I did

314
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,149
write some of this stuff down so that I

315
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,720
actually sound like I know what I'm

316
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,039
talking about

317
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
and they told me that I got it all right

318
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,189
on the Instagram live video and I just

319
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,450
pulled it pulled it out of my ass and

320
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,890
shot it out off the top of my head and I

321
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,350
hope I got it right they all said I did

322
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,730
so I was proud of myself there so I made

323
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,190
notes this time so that we can talk

324
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,430
about what land races are what an IBL

325
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,380
what an f1 through f5 and so forth and

326
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,789
we'll talk about a few other things but

327
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:47,439
if you don't know what I'm talking about

328
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:49,299
here's where I'm headed with this if you

329
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,190
go to shop for seeds if you're looking

330
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,959
to buy a new package of seeds and you

331
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,610
want to grow something new there's a

332
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,840
whole bunch of letters and numbers on

333
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,200
the package that may not make sense

334
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,940
you'll see let me just pick a cross that

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,830
I want to go random but I'm gonna pick

336
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,410
something of mine of course let's say a

337
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:09,910
storm shadow storm shadow is White Widow

338
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:11,889
cross to theorize that's kind of an f1

339
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:14,469
it's also kind of a poly hybrid so I

340
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,149
would just write storm shadow X arise

341
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,970
that would show you storm shadow to

342
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:21,159
arise it should always be listed with

343
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,080
ladies first whichever female plant was

344
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,299
used since the storm shadow was the girl

345
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,860
plant ladies first storms or white widow

346
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:30,549
I'm sorry the white widow was the female

347
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,960
plant white widow X arise now it's a

348
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,669
white widow girl that's obvious because

349
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,019
the girls ladies first is how it goes

350
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,959
when you're listing genetics white widow

351
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:41,559
X arise now a lot of breeders will put

352
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,750
either an f1 or an f2 after that now if

353
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,539
you're gonna put an f1 or an f2 you have

354
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,429
to put the white widow to arise white

355
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,279
widow X arise in parentheses and then

356
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:52,989
put f1 or f2 next to that because that

357
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,870
will indicate that that whole cross it's

358
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,830
the f2 of that cross so now let me talk

359
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,600
about what I know that may sound

360
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,870
confusing but it'll make more sense one

361
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,779
nice

362
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,450
talking about what an f1 is what an f1

363
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:07,779
f1 F stands for filial the filial

364
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,730
generation number one if I take you

365
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,829
create an f1 by crossing two different

366
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,600
parents and when you indicate parents

367
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,050
when you're listening genetics it is a P

368
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,250
the letter P represents parent excuse

369
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,799
the throat clearing you guys that big

370
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,990
dab is still getting me so crossing to

371
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,149
different parents will result in an f1

372
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,879
and those parents should be either

373
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,350
inbred lines or land races and those

374
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,939
will make F once a lot of what you're

375
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,440
buying now our poly hybrids and we're

376
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,530
gonna talk about that a little bit later

377
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,720
in the episode ah but to F will are

378
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:40,539
crossing two different strains that are

379
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,259
either stabilized IB LS or stabilized

380
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:44,559
landraces

381
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,759
will make your f1 F ones the first cross

382
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,379
if you take two different things a boy

383
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,480
and a girl and cross some filial

384
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,039
generation one brand new [ __ ] that nunu

385
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,600
is f1 all right

386
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,389
so F ones are cool because they have

387
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,100
hybrid hybrid vigor which means they're

388
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,539
it's two new things that have finally

389
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,250
hit and there's so much new energy in

390
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:01,990
there those plants are gonna grow huge

391
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,990
they're gonna grow better than the other

392
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,220
parents then your parents so hybrid

393
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,129
vigor is gonna come out of there

394
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,540
Oh F 1 is semis stable and phenotypes

395
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,009
you're gonna see phenotypes that look

396
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,079
like mommy you're gonna see phenotypes

397
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,580
it look like Daddy you're gonna see some

398
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,009
that mix and then you're gonna see some

399
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,540
that are widely different okay way off

400
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,279
there but you're gonna get pretty close

401
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:25,079
to mommy and daddy and then the crosses

402
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:28,419
your prep probably 25% mommy 25% daddy

403
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,730
25% a perfect cross and then 25% of them

404
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,229
are just gonna be [ __ ] whatever like

405
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,029
whatever genetics are in there you'll

406
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,370
see crosses of all kinds of weird [ __ ]

407
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,399
in 25% of them and that's a guess you

408
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,710
guys I can only estimate on genetics on

409
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,179
what you're gonna see but on average

410
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,830
that's kind of what you can expect

411
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,809
so F ones are cool because they've got

412
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,940
that hybrid vigor you're gonna see a lot

413
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,649
of cool phenotypes from an f1 hybrid and

414
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,290
now you've got some brand-new [ __ ]

415
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,590
that's why F ones are cool so now if you

416
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:58,240
grow if you take a male and a female of

417
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,920
two different strains and you pollinate

418
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,289
the female and seeds come out you have

419
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,539
now made f1 you take those seeds and you

420
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,578
grow them

421
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,230
and you can either just leave him open

422
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,638
and you can have all the males and all

423
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,129
the girls together or you can take a

424
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,778
select male and a select girl or you can

425
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,669
take a select male in several select

426
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,769
girls and you can pollinate that way so

427
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:19,889
it's either open pollination of a whole

428
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,419
bunch of F wands or select selective

429
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,568
breeding of F ones if you pollinate that

430
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,669
together the seeds that come out of the

431
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:28,259
F ones if you take a seed from f1 and a

432
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,458
seed from f1 and once a boy wants a girl

433
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,680
or there's a cluster of boys and girls

434
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:35,939
the seeds that come from that are f2

435
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:38,388
filial generation f2 now those you're

436
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,920
gonna have a little more stabilization

437
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:42,899
than the F ones are gonna get a little

438
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,068
bit closer but you're gonna see some

439
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,240
random [ __ ] and then you're gonna have

440
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:50,610
50% mom 50% dad and then some generate

441
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,440
some some variation in their f2 s are

442
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,269
always it depends on how the selective

443
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,380
breeding process went if you do an open

444
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,060
pollination you're gonna get a whole

445
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:59,220
bunch of different phenotypes some

446
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,500
people like that if you did a selective

447
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,319
breeding you're gonna see less different

448
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,240
variation in the phenotypes so now if I

449
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:08,519
take my favorite male and my favorite

450
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,860
female from that f2 and I breed them now

451
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,230
I've just made an f3 and you continue

452
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,269
doing that you can continue doing that

453
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,190
until you reach whatever number you'd

454
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,649
like but by the time you get to the f4

455
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,630
they have 5 generation if you've done

456
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,698
your breeding correctly things will

457
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,789
start coming out like clones if you

458
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:28,828
plant 50 seeds and 25 were male because

459
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,528
these are regular regular these are not

460
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:33,568
feminized if you plant 50 25 of them

461
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:36,028
about 25 we're gonna be at 50%

462
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:38,039
25 will be males and then 25 of them are

463
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:39,720
gonna look almost like clones are gonna

464
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,849
be very identical if you've done your

465
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,100
breeding properly now if you keep

466
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,629
breeding you work on what is known as an

467
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,009
inbred line because you are just

468
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:49,139
inbreeding which means you are actually

469
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,610
eliminating traits because you are

470
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,259
breeding for selective traits and you're

471
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,360
narrowing it down true you're just

472
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,519
inbreeding and inbreeding to get the

473
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,829
perfect plant now that's when you have

474
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,959
created an inbred line an inbred line

475
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:03,000
also known as an IBL you guys in it

476
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,500
brenton inbred Lahaina or hybrids or

477
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,110
crosses that have been stabilized to

478
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,129
show very little variation like I was

479
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,068
talking about they almost look like

480
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,559
you're making clones you in breed by

481
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:16,078
just selecting the plant that looks just

482
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,399
like you want and then breed that one

483
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,719
and then pull the seeds out

484
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,689
and growin and find one that looks just

485
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,000
like what you want and then make f4 of

486
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,770
that and then find ones that look just

487
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,149
like what you want make the f5 of that

488
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,220
by the time you get to f5 they're all

489
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,110
gonna start looking like how you want

490
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,399
them to so that's your inbreeding it to

491
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,750
get exactly where you want it you may

492
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,370
need to go further you may need to go F

493
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,769
six you may need to go F seven I

494
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,830
personally have never seen anybody go

495
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,449
past and f5 that I know of but I would

496
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,100
be interesting to see what happens f5

497
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,230
seems to be far enough to get these

498
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,210
seeds completely stabilized to make them

499
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,580
how we want him DJ short said if he goes

500
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,990
past f5 when he sells them it doesn't

501
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,060
leave any work for the public to breed

502
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,620
with them so there's nothing left they

503
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,559
all come out looking just like what he

504
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,480
did if he goes to the f6 so I guess uh

505
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,699
DJ short has gone f6 and he just goes

506
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,740
back to the f5 and releases those he's

507
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,240
probably he's been breeding for longer

508
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,160
than I've been alive I think so he's

509
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,079
probably got some half sevens f 9s or

510
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,490
some [ __ ] in his arsenal he just doesn't

511
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,649
release him or talk about him too much

512
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,720
anyway that's when you get yourself to

513
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,060
an IPL an inbred line is when you inbred

514
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,680
it so much that it's super stabilized to

515
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,659
where almost every seed you plant comes

516
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,670
out looking like a clone of the last

517
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,890
seed you planted or the next seed you're

518
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,519
gonna plant from that same filial

519
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,530
generation so a very common way to find

520
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,920
an inbred plant aren't I BL line an

521
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:38,339
inbred line is a land race land braces

522
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,380
are purebred lines from specific areas a

523
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,689
lot of people know about like durbin

524
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,930
poison the legendary Durban poison is a

525
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,930
land race from the Durban area of Africa

526
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,789
it's very stabilized it probably came

527
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,880
and I don't know how accurate this is

528
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:55,379
you guys this is what my kind of if I

529
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,750
had to make up a story of a land race

530
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,940
plant this is what it would be somewhere

531
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,980
somebody traveled to a place and they

532
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,900
gave somebody some weed and that person

533
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,430
smoke that weed and they're like holy

534
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,720
[ __ ] and this is like thousands of years

535
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,279
ago in my mind I don't know how long

536
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,339
honestly I don't know I'm making up this

537
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,569
vision in my head right now ah some two

538
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,129
people that spoke different languages

539
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,079
from different villages were traveling

540
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,540
somewhere and one guy brought a bunch of

541
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,699
weed I'd not have not even a bunch just

542
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,139
some and he shared some weed with this

543
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,450
guy in this other village and he got

544
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,650
five seeds out of it and that guy smoke

545
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,759
that weed and he's like holy [ __ ] that

546
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,590
[ __ ] was good I have to grow those

547
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,269
[ __ ] seeds and he grew the seeds and

548
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,959
he didn't know anything about pulling

549
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,339
males because

550
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,750
this was way back in the day they didn't

551
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,538
worry about that they didn't know they

552
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,970
wanted since Amelia buds so he grew all

553
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:40,408
five seeds and they got crossed the

554
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,788
males and the females all bred with each

555
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,470
other and the seeds fell into the ground

556
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,898
just like it's supposed to and now he

557
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,149
had like a thousand seeds just plant out

558
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:49,678
next to sprout up next year and he's

559
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:51,719
like oh [ __ ] that's a lot so he cut down

560
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,990
some but the males and females that

561
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,480
survived they bred again and it happened

562
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,120
year after year after year so this guy

563
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,450
only had one strain of herb on his

564
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,428
property for however many years he grew

565
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,899
weed and then his son took over and his

566
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,120
son grew that same strain on that

567
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:10,408
property or maybe nature did it maybe

568
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,908
the people that grew it a hundred

569
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,880
thousand years ago died and nature took

570
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,679
over and it's been F nature f27 to this

571
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,120
[ __ ] plant out there without anybody

572
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,440
intervening because that's what cannabis

573
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,639
would do if nobody got in the way it

574
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,500
would just keep going your after year

575
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,350
after year so maybe this plants on like

576
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,079
f 200 you know and so that's a land race

577
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:31,528
that's an inbred land race it's inbred

578
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,908
itself so far and now it's just every

579
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:34,829
seed that you plant is gonna look and

580
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,270
smell just like that that's what I think

581
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:39,329
a land race is I think an inbred line

582
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:42,089
and a land race are very similar but I

583
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:44,339
think n breads are kind of done human

584
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:45,750
and a land race was done by Nature over

585
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,829
a course of time before humans

586
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,240
intervened so imagine traveling back way

587
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:53,250
back in the day whatever you believe the

588
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,720
earth was like it's round whatever the

589
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,519
[ __ ] you believe right now it was still

590
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,079
round two then it's still round now but

591
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,359
people are traveling around it then and

592
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,678
it could be one piece of continent it

593
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,579
could be a broken up bunch of cotton

594
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,960
it's it could be a whatever you'd be

595
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,210
alive that way as long as you agree that

596
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,620
it's [ __ ] round come on but somebody

597
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,600
got some herbs somewhere they traveled

598
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,099
around and they dropped obviously they

599
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,048
dropped some off in Thailand cuz there's

600
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,519
Thailand races they drop some off in

601
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:16,619
Brazil because there's Brazilian land

602
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,798
races and they just dropped off a few

603
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,808
seeds and at F 37 itself and I'm just

604
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,679
being hypothetical with AF 37 s and

605
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:24,359
whatever but that's kind of what

606
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,769
happened somebody traveled around with a

607
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,769
little bit of weed and it got dropped in

608
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:30,990
off off in all these places Vietnam so

609
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,639
there's Vietnamese land races of course

610
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,109
there's Afghan land races their land

611
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,850
races everywhere there are Mexican land

612
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,439
races Mexican sativa LAN races are

613
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:39,719
[ __ ] amazing it's funny because

614
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,159
people are afraid of Mexican land races

615
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,538
because they think it's gonna be schwag

616
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,310
weed just because most of the weed they

617
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:45,869
bought from Mexico was compressed

618
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,460
that doesn't make any [ __ ] sense I

619
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,229
just think it's hilarious but so that's

620
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,240
what I that's my take on a land race

621
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,860
seeds got traveled around way back

622
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,660
before it was common for people to get

623
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,819
around a whole bunch they were

624
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,529
unadulterated and they just bred

625
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:01,559
themselves either with the help of a

626
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,240
local farmer or by nature but there were

627
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,269
no more seeds introduced there were no

628
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,240
more variations or no more varietals

629
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:11,490
introduced to that to breed to out breed

630
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,079
that to out cross it so that's a land

631
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,940
race it just stayed the same and kept

632
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,129
stabilizing itself and getting better

633
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,170
and better over time and that's what it

634
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,520
is those genetics are those genetics

635
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,610
they never got adulterated

636
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,400
so that's landraces inbred lines and

637
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:29,429
filial generations one through five now

638
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,930
let's talk about something else you

639
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:37,830
might see on a seed pack is BX BX stands

640
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:41,130
for bat crossing now bat crossing would

641
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:43,079
be if I took an f1 so if I cross some

642
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,480
stuff let's say we'll just go with the

643
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,720
the golden go to the Daybreaker cross

644
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,009
those you may can arise f1 now if I took

645
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,640
and arise f1 seed and pollinated it with

646
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:57,900
the original Daybreaker male that would

647
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,160
be a bat cross and I was really

648
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,570
confusing for me to do because I was

649
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,509
trying to make all the different names

650
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,439
of the strains as I did it so and I'm

651
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:05,490
gonna say it again just to make sure I

652
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,990
get it right I'm gonna read my notes

653
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,789
without using strain names back crossing

654
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,670
is crossing an f1 back to an original

655
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,710
parent you guys so you make an f1 with a

656
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,420
boy and a girl the baby comes out and

657
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,670
then you either can cross it back to the

658
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,800
boy or back to the dad or back to the

659
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,590
mom that's a back cross and now people

660
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,240
might say why would you want to do that

661
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:25,859
I've got a good explanation of why and

662
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,370
this will lead me into B x2 which is a

663
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,829
back cross number two so let's say you

664
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:33,419
want to make seeds that are not

665
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:35,009
feminized because if you want them to be

666
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,620
feminized it's a different process if

667
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,809
you want regular seeds of a strain that

668
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,189
is clone only and you do not have you

669
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,409
have a female of it but you don't have a

670
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,440
male of it what you can do is create a

671
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,930
back cross so perhaps I want to make

672
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,910
grateful dog there is not a male of

673
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,190
grateful dog I've only got a female of

674
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,500
grateful dog maybe I want to make

675
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,970
grateful dog seeds that are not

676
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,169
feminized because I made feminized seeds

677
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,028
that's the only way it's a

678
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,249
feminize grateful dog let's say I want

679
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:03,569
to make my favorite grateful dog female

680
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:05,999
that I've got I want to make it

681
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:08,638
available in regular seeds I would find

682
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:10,618
something that is similar to it kind of

683
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,969
kind of similar to it or maybe I'd fun I

684
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,738
don't know there's two different routes

685
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,169
to go there I would cross it with a male

686
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:17,759
okay I would find a male if you cross it

687
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:19,830
with a male that's very similar to it

688
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,329
it's gonna be harder to find the male

689
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:23,158
that looks like the grateful dog to

690
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,960
reuse for the BX but if you cross it to

691
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,340
a male that's very different the one

692
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,778
that's closer to the grateful dog will

693
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,658
stand out and it will be easier to

694
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:32,608
determine which one to bat cross with

695
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:35,340
that that's a whole lot of different

696
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,439
talking but for this example we're going

697
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,238
to take the Grateful dog female and

698
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,220
since I've got the arize male on my mind

699
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:43,169
we're going to use the arize male we're

700
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,659
gonna pollinate that grateful dog with

701
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:48,419
the arize now we have just made aa

702
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:51,169
that's actually morning dew so now let's

703
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,999
take morning dew and find a morning dew

704
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:56,159
male I want to find a male out of this

705
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:58,858
morning dew that looks just like the

706
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,169
grateful dog so now I've got a male

707
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:02,939
grateful dog kind of looking plant and I

708
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:06,960
want to pollinate that female grateful

709
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,239
dog now I have just made a BX I have

710
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,278
made a bat cross now there's another way

711
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,230
you could do that I could take one of

712
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,730
those morning dew seeds and I could find

713
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,288
a female that looks just like the

714
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,569
grateful dog and then I can take that

715
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,940
original rise pollen and throw that on

716
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:23,220
there again and then that's gonna make

717
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,659
more seeds that would actually be a bat

718
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,368
cross again but it's not the way I was

719
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,350
trying to go I was trying to make the

720
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,849
grateful dog and I think by finding the

721
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:31,469
male that looks like the grateful dog

722
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,839
and putting it back on the grateful dog

723
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,999
female I'm gonna be putting so many

724
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,069
grateful dog dominant genetics into

725
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:40,379
there I think it's gonna be very

726
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:42,239
grateful dog dominant then I will take

727
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:44,939
seeds that come from that so now I have

728
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:47,159
taken the morning dew the morning dew

729
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,808
male it looks like grateful dog and I

730
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,509
put it back on to the grateful dog

731
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:54,628
female right now I've made grateful dog

732
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:57,419
bx1 because I have gone backwards and

733
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:59,099
used the grateful dog female that was in

734
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,299
there I'm back crossing you can do it

735
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,308
with the male you can do it with the

736
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,450
female either way it works but my goal

737
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:06,450
right now is to try to make that

738
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,940
grateful dog in regular seed so now I've

739
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,190
made the morning dew to the Grateful dog

740
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,890
back cross now I would take seeds that

741
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,769
come from

742
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,560
I would grow those BX ones and find one

743
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:20,170
that looks just like a grateful dog and

744
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,849
once again I would back cross and I'm

745
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,440
gonna find a male and I'm gonna take

746
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:25,359
that male that looks like the grateful

747
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,410
dog and I'm gonna put that pollen on my

748
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:32,589
female grateful dog and now I have made

749
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:34,750
grateful dog BX to regular seed that's

750
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:36,579
what that would be you guys I'm gonna

751
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,230
press pause I'm gonna take a drink in a

752
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,269
DAB and I'm actually gonna listen back

753
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,039
to this and make sure I feel like I got

754
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,559
this right if you've got any comments or

755
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,629
concerns on what I've just said I would

756
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,099
love all of your input you can send me

757

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,789
Facebook I love the interaction you guys

763
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,220
I'm gonna press pause gonna take a drink

764
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:11,349
gonna dab some of this Tahoe batter and

765
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:13,059
then I'll be right back all right

766
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,439
podcast rolled I am back i listened to

767
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,109
back to everything i said and i feel

768
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,570
like i was accurate and what i spoke so

769
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:23,799
I'm gonna continue another thing we need

770
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:25,089
to talk about our um feminized seeds now

771
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,769
feminized seeds are labeled differently

772
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,720
or at least they should be

773
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:30,639
they aren't oftentimes labeled correctly

774
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,680
is what I've noticed but that's uh

775
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,570
that's up to individual breeders I feel

776
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,180
like they should be labeled um as

777
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:40,029
feminized at least and then the correct

778
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,799
if you're labeling them genetics wise to

779
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:43,359
list what they are like on a website if

780
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,109
you're gonna say hey this crosses this

781
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,599
to this um it would be an S one if you

782
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,009
took a and we're just gonna pick a

783
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,169
random strain that we keep playing with

784
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,259
the Grateful dog if I took the Grateful

785
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,450
dog and I reversed it which would mean I

786
00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:02,259
treated it with silver thiosulfate or

787
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,850
gibberellic acid or maybe the other type

788
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,319
of silver colonial silver which I don't

789
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,779
feel works well enough I do the silver

790
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:10,000
thiosulfate myself but if you treated

791
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:12,670
the Grateful dog plant and pollinated

792
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,049
another clone of the Grateful dog the

793
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,670
same plant it's got to be the same

794
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,980
cultivar you have to reverse one and

795
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:21,070
pollinate one that is the same cultivar

796
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,630
that is reversing the same cut and

797
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:25,428
pollinating the same cut you are now

798
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,519
making S ones that is a self

799
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:30,679
that is an s-1 is what that is so if you

800
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,220
reverse a strain and make seeds of

801
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,639
itself

802
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,558
you are making s ones now if I were to

803
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:38,629
reverse that grateful dog and take that

804
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,839
grateful dog pollen that is now

805
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:44,000
feminized pollen and I put that pollen

806
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,699
on any plant other than the grateful dog

807
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,980
I am making what is known as an r1 a

808
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,769
reversal one so I'm using feminized

809
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,710
pollen on a different cut to create new

810
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:57,109
feminized poly hybrid is basically what

811
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,889
I'm doing so those are two that you need

812
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:03,349
to know about s1 and r1 now earlier I

813
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:05,599
said something about breeding with

814
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:08,209
landraces and breeding with inbred wines

815
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,369
a lot of what you see available in the

816
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,960
seed catalogs and I read genetics

817
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,729
included I'm not calling anybody out I

818
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,038
am part of this group a lot of what we

819
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,960
are breeding is actually poly hybrids

820
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:20,000
we're taking F ones and f2s

821
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,720
possibly F threes and breeding them to

822
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,849
other F ones or f2 s and they are not

823
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,788
completely stabilized plants that are

824
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:30,980
being used for breeding although through

825
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:33,440
experimentation and testing those plants

826
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,149
have been tested well enough for my

827
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,679
approval to be used in breeding I know

828
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:39,319
they're not gonna hermaphrodite on me I

829
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,929
know that the progeny they create is not

830
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:44,089
problematic so they are yes they are

831
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:47,629
poly hybrids but they are stable enough

832
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:49,668
most of us breeders are aware enough and

833
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:52,579
educated enough and experienced enough

834
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,649
to know if that strain is worth crossing

835
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:56,960
or not it would be a good idea for us to

836
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:58,939
breed something to the f5 before we

837
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,460
crossed it to something else that would

838
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,288
make a true f1 but the poly hybrids is

839
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,240
kind of where the market has gone to now

840
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:08,658
it's kind of where cannabis breeding has

841
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,659
gone to now it's got its pros and it's

842
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:14,389
cons so now that you know all of the

843
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:16,399
glossary words we have got landrace

844
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:19,128
we've got an IB L which means an inbred

845
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,258
line we've got f1 f2 s all the way up to

846
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:24,109
f5 s when you start becoming an IB L

847
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:26,808
basically you can go F six or seven I

848
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:28,668
talked about nature probably doing F 50

849
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,168
you never know honestly I really don't

850
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,028
know there's probably somewhere in some

851
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,500
jungle or on some island that those

852
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:35,538
plants have just been making their

853
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,829
finial generations without interruption

854
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:38,629
that we don't even know about yet

855
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:41,029
so you can you've got the F Jenner

856
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,820
relations then we've got back crosses

857
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,200
which is when you take an f1 back to the

858
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:48,679
parent and then you've got a back cross

859
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,960
to is when you take a BX one back to the

860
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,340
parent then we have got the self which

861
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,950
is when we start playing with feminised

862
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:56,689
seeds then you've got the r1 then we've

863
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,220
got poly hybrids which is mostly what

864
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,900
we're seeing on the market now that

865
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,519
we've got all these glossary terms let's

866
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,280
talk a little bit about the labeling on

867
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,250
seed packages a lot of the companies do

868
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:10,670
it differently I myself will list golden

869
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:12,859
goat x day breaker and then it will say

870
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,230
arise because that's golden go across

871
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:16,849
the day breaker that makes a rise that's

872
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,309
what you're gonna get there are other

873
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:21,199
breeders who will list that would list

874
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:24,019
the genetics of the golden goat in a

875
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,700
parentheses which would be ah in one

876
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:27,259
bracket you'd have a parentheses and

877
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,259
then it would say island sweet skunk X

878
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,180
Romulan then in other parentheses then

879
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,879
it would say Hawaiian sativa then

880
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,380
another parenthesis closing that so that

881
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,800
shows you that it's an island sweet

882
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,110
skunk to Romulan female cross to a

883
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,730
Hawaiian sativa male in one set of

884
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:46,219
parentheses like a math problem so you

885
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,599
got parentheses starting it and then

886
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,069
another one closing it and then another

887
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,500
one even closing it I don't know what

888
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:53,389
direction you call those parentheses but

889
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,500
one part sinter parentheses and then

890
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,440
there's another one on the end of that

891
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,410
to make that all one equation x the day

892
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,549
breaker which is joseph OG x chem d that

893
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,980
those two would be in parentheses

894
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:06,109
together so it showed the male the

895
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,230
breakdown of the male all in parentheses

896
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:11,629
x the breakdown of the are the female x

897
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,610
the male all broken down into genetics

898
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,320
that's how some folks do it now

899
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:17,839
sometimes you might see I'm gonna get

900
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:22,460
hypothetical right now you may see just

901
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:25,339
a pack labeled arise BX 2 now that means

902
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,259
the arize was back crossed but they

903
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:29,899
don't that does not indicate what male

904
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:31,940
was used or what female was used in the

905
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,009
back cross that may be listed in the

906
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,900
parentheses underneath it just depends

907
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:38,930
on how they do it now that means that

908
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:42,800
that is the progeny of the back cross it

909
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:47,019
doesn't say now they may say arise BX 2

910
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,579
in parentheses or arise BX 2 x

911
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:51,950
Daybreaker in parentheses and that means

912
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:54,259
that the arise BX 2 was used so where

913
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,909
those parentheses fall kind of indicate

914
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,339
which group the plants were in so

915
00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:00,620
everything in the brackets is that plant

916
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:02,209
and then if it stays inside of another

917
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,369
set of brackets it's still that plant

918
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,700
but it's the male or the female so I

919
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:09,168
think what I said makes sense because if

920
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,940
you're listening the grandparents if

921
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:13,700
you're going that far to list your stuff

922
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,970
it's going to be female X male in

923
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,169
parentheses X female X male in

924
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,909
parentheses and the first set of

925
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,528
parentheses will be the female the

926
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:23,809
second set will be the male now

927
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:26,179
sometimes you're gonna see maybe a

928
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,918
breeder used something that's got three

929
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:29,960
things in it because maybe he took a boy

930
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,269
and a girl and crossed those and then

931
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,069
crossed those to another boy and use the

932
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:38,000
offspring of that as a female in the

933
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:42,528
project so that would have female X male

934
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,179
and parentheses X male and then you just

935
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,319
put another parentheses to close that

936
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,750
and that would show you that that's your

937
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,769
female and then X and then whatever your

938
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,778
male is on there

939
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:52,399
I hope I'm explaining that properly

940
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,808
without writing it down on a dry erase

941
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,099
board and showing you what I'm doing and

942
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:58,490
feel like I might just be confusing you

943
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,619
but keep this in mind ladies first and

944
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,599
if it gets too confusing when you're

945
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,489
trying to write something down just make

946
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,730
it simpler instead of writing all this

947
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:10,788
Exodus Exodus parentheses just write

948
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,500
golden goat times Daybreaker arise you

949
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,788
get right to the point it's easier but I

950
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,109
want you to be able to understand it if

951
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,460
you do see all these weird labels

952
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,769
because some people try to just make it

953
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,940
look fancy some folks out there I'll

954
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,349
give a lot of respect and a lot of

955
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,389
acknowledgement to Collin Gordon and the

956
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:25,719
ethos collective those guys label their

957
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:28,369
[ __ ] correctly it's a little confusing

958
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,450
but if you're an experienced grower and

959
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:31,099
you know what you're looking at it makes

960
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,319
a lot of sense and it is very helpful

961
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:35,480
because they offer different versions of

962
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,980
the same line which can be confusing if

963
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,419
you don't know what you're looking at so

964
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,769
I hope you guys learned a whole bunch I

965
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:41,480
may have just confused you guys a whole

966
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,190
bunch more talking to you about how to

967
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,230
label things and how to read a seed

968
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,970
package I would honestly love your

969

Facebook alright now since I've talked

978
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,470
about land races and inbred lines

979
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,779
and all this breeding stuff I want to

980
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,519
talk about something that I've seen in a

981
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,050
couple of videos now there's a breeder a

982
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,539
group of readers that travel around the

983
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,830
world and they like to go to places and

984
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:17,809
I'm not hating on them I'm just bringing

985
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:20,090
this up to spark conversation I actually

986
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:21,918
respect these folks they do great work

987
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,960
they've done a lot of work for the

988
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,579
cannabis community and the industry let

989
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,539
me say that before I kind of say what

990
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,039
I'm gonna say and then we'll talk about

991
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:31,070
I want to make a conversation out of

992
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,259
this um so these breeders they travel

993
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,470
around the world and they go to places

994
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,850
like Africa like Jamaica like they've

995
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:39,378
gone all over the [ __ ] world to tell

996
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,730
you the truth they go everywhere they've

997
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,199
got a lot of money and they've got

998
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,579
private jets and they know a lot of

999
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,888
people they get all over the [ __ ]

1000
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:49,668
world so these guys get access to go

1001
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,649
visit very large outdoor ganja farms all

1002
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:54,440
over the planet now a lot of these

1003
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:55,849
outdoor ganja farms are older than me

1004
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,650
they are older than these guys that are

1005
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:00,349
going to visit these are the places

1006
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,079
where the land race strains are being

1007
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:04,730
grown just organically these guys didn't

1008
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,889
have access to any other seeds nobody

1009
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,659
goes there nobody that goes there is

1010
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:10,460
bringing cannabis seeds it wasn't like

1011
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:12,099
hey I should go to Jamaica and take

1012
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,059
cannabis seeds nobody ever said that

1013
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,219
everybody thinks I should go to Jamaica

1014
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:19,940
and get cannabis seeds nobody nobody

1015
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:21,619
takes sand to the beach so the land race

1016
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,940
strains I'm just gonna guess Jamaica now

1017
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,130
because I've said that that's gonna be

1018
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,960
what we stick with the land race that is

1019
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,460
growing in Jamaica that these folks who

1020
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,869
went down there and found they went

1021
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,550
through it they were like this one this

1022
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,019
one's [ __ ] awesome and they broke

1023
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,220
open a couple of buds and they told the

1024
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,630
guy that owned the farm they're like can

1025
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:37,009
I take these seeds and the guy was like

1026
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,309
oh yeah you could take plenty of seeds

1027
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,560
so now this breeder brought home a big

1028
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:44,989
old jar of Jamaican landrace seeds

1029
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,519
[ __ ] awesome cool now he's got them

1030
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:49,099
they're preserved he's gonna breed with

1031
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,380
them he bred them to the next filial

1032
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:52,759
generation he actually sold them through

1033
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,980
his website and through his breeding

1034
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,390
company through his seed company and in

1035
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,269
his coffee shops in Amsterdam

1036
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:01,460
now here's what he did in return he

1037
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:03,889
reached into his pocket and he offered

1038
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,590
this farmer handfuls of his own seed

1039
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:08,420
that he is bred now this company color

1040
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:11,390
coats all of their seeds they've got a

1041
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,559
product that so they make a prod a

1042
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:13,639
strain called and you're gonna figure

1043
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,570
out who I'm talking about if you know

1044
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,099
what I'm talking about what I'm just not

1045
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,080
gonna say their name they make super

1046
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,860
Lemon Haze they coat all of their super

1047
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,750
Lemon Haze see

1048
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,340
it's in a yellow coating so that you can

1049
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,869
just put them in a baggie and carry them

1050
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,460
and they don't have to be labeled and

1051
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,319
you know those yellow seeds are super

1052
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,119
Lemon Haze and then they coat all of

1053
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,590
them each screens got its own color and

1054
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,179
I don't know what the colors for all of

1055
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,680
them are just obvious that super Lemon

1056
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:35,989
Haze was the yellow one that's what I

1057
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,549
remember so he reaches into his pocket

1058
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:40,399
and pulls out well it looks like a bag

1059
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,530
of M&amp;Ms and it's just colored feminized

1060
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,389
and regular seeds and he puts them in

1061
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:48,740
the farmers hand and says thank you for

1062
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:51,379
the trade grow these next year now great

1063
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,969
trade right really cool our friend with

1064
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,340
the seed company has now got some great

1065
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:57,169
new Jamaican land race genetics the

1066
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,900
Jamaican guy has now got some new [ __ ]

1067
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,519
to grow the problem is and I don't know

1068
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,960
if it's a problem I'm just curious about

1069
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,949
this and I want to know how you guys

1070
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,710
feel that land race in Jamaica it's been

1071
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:13,149
growing there forever on that island

1072
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:15,380
without human adulteration has been

1073
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,840
inbreeding itself in making itself

1074
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,369
perfect for that climate and it produces

1075
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,350
the product that they're familiar with

1076
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:24,769
every year and it drops seeds and it

1077
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:26,769
grows and it does it again no has this

1078
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:29,539
breeding company has this seed sharer

1079
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:31,309
adulterated that land race by dropping

1080
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,889
off these other seeds on this island

1081
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:35,690
because the pollens gonna travel is

1082
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:37,069
everything gonna get pollinated by these

1083
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,809
other seeds that he left because there

1084
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,920
were feminized and non feminized there

1085
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:42,650
were regular seeds in there so there

1086
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,510
will be males to pull and these guys do

1087
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,579
not pull males they they throw out so

1088
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,080
many seeds and they just let it grow

1089
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,519
naturally they don't call any seeds

1090
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,650
because they want

1091
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,789
ah they want the seeds for next year

1092
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,769
they want them to fall and they want the

1093
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,719
seeds of thing grow dope mixture because

1094
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:57,800
they don't go get seeds from anybody

1095
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,779
that's not what they do they've just

1096
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,220
been using this inbred land race so I

1097
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,630
kind of want your interaction on this

1098
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:04,579
how do you guys feel about this are they

1099
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,039
traveling around the world adulterating

1100
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,599
land races while at the same time

1101
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,159
collecting land race seeds so that they

1102
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,980
can breed them for their own use are

1103
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,259
they kind of does that seem like sort of

1104
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,030
a a ploy maybe eventually there won't be

1105
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,530
any land races and until you have to go

1106
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,269
shop with them to get them because

1107
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,490
they've traveled all over the world and

1108
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:24,139
picked up some of the land race from

1109
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:25,909
everywhere and labelled it very well

1110
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:27,230
they've got land races from different

1111
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:29,329
regions of different countries they've

1112
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,869
got northern Jamaica southern Jamaica

1113
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:33,239
land races and they've got them laid

1114
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,799
they know exactly what they are but they

1115
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,299
also dropped off their own seeds there

1116
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,620
and I'm sure that those farmers planted

1117
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,880
it because those farmers probably

1118
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,949
weren't thinking the way that I think

1119
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
they weren't like you came to disrupt my

1120
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,309
my land race and he's gonna do something

1121
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,630
to the future of cannabis I don't know

1122
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:46,829
is it disrupting their crop is it

1123
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,599
improving their crop do you think it's

1124
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:49,889
detrimental to their crop I kind of want

1125
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,750
your opinion because it just sparked a

1126
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:52,980
lot of thoughts in my mind so I want to

1127
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,239
know what you think interact with me

1128
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,179
let's have a conversation about it you

1129
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,089
guys email me tweet me social media with

1130
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,139
me about it and go watch the videos if

1131
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,550
you know what I'm talking about go watch

1132
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,460
the videos again and see what you think

1133
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:08,370
I'm just curious on your opinion there's

1134
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,809
one thing I should say to that and I was

1135
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,239
only just using Jamaica as an example

1136
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:14,009
there are great growers in Jamaica

1137
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,629
especially now but there have always

1138
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,700
been great growers in Jamaica some folks

1139
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,890
were calling the mails they were able to

1140
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,179
get other good seeds in Jamaica but just

1141
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:24,000
a lot of the places that I'm talking

1142
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,039
about are like mountainside rural places

1143
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,840
and if you've seen the videos these guys

1144
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,820
have gone to dozens of different

1145
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,910
countries and gathered cannabis seeds so

1146
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,840
also what can we do about it

1147
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,250
I guess if I'm gonna start a

1148
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,660
conversation and bring up a problem I

1149
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,170
should have a solution right I guess if

1150
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,009
you are a seed collector if you are a

1151
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,829
conservationist or a preserver of

1152
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:47,100
cannabis seeds maybe you should find a

1153
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:48,960
good vendor that's got reliable landrace

1154
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,579
seeds and get your hands on all the land

1155
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,260
races that you think you may be

1156
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:54,539
interested in before they get all

1157
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,850
adulterated and messed up with the new

1158
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:58,829
cannabis revolution because money is

1159
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:01,699
getting involved so everything worldwide

1160
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:04,110
is going to change with cannabis

1161
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,699
