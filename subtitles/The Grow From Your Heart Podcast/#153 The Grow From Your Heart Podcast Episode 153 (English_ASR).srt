it's funny [ __ ] work tools out if you're

44
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,580
listening working just move on what I

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,069
wanted to talk about first is everyone's

46
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,790
talking about this honey bee thing on

47
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:30,399
Facebook people are claiming that this

48
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:34,628
dude in France is has trained his honey

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,469
bees to make THC Laden honey by

50
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:41,709
collecting THC from cannabis plants now

51
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,699
I'm not a bee expert but I don't think

52
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,689
that's how this works

53
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:48,399
i I'm here to say that I don't think

54
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,859
that this is real I think it's [ __ ]

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,569
to tell you the truth I when I first saw

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,180
it online I was like oh that's really

57
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:59,738
cool I want to wait bees collect pollen

58
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,980
yes trichomes collect pollen yes they

59
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,019
are not themselves blowing the pistils

60
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,159
collect the pollen to be more to be more

61
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,960
accurate but the

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,659
and is actually used as a defense

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,570
against insects and they do show

64
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:17,680
pictures of bees on the canopy on the

65
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,810
female cannabis plants and what somebody

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,700
says in one of these debunking websites

67
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,560
because I did do research before I came

68
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,209
on long checked it out on a podcast and

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,620
said that it was [ __ ] I did do some

70
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,180
research to back myself up they claimed

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,640
that they just simply sprayed sugar

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,280
water on the budding female plants to

73
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,250
encourage those bees to land there yes

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,009
maybe a little bit of THC as a marketing

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,139
ploy for homeys honey I think so yeah so

76
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,299
in his video they do show male plants

77
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,609
yeah so what I think may be happening

78
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,000
and I'm gonna back up a little bit this

79
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,040
guy says he's getting THC honey from

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,900
cannabis plant he can be doing that he

81
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,120
maybe that's totally a thing it's just

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,010
not gonna be psychoactive right he may

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
be getting pollen from male cannabis

84
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,759
plants those bees are gathering that

85
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,439
pollen they're flying back to their hive

86
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,370
they're putting that pollen and little

87
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,250
thing that they put it in a little

88
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,560
honeycomb and then they actually bees

89
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,180
actually chew up the pollen in their

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,370
mouths and they regurgitate it and

91
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,370
something in their regurgitation creates

92
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,750
the the nectar to turn into honey so

93
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,129
this is why I don't like knowing how

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,870
everything's made yes

95
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,519
nature's [ __ ] gross I really like

96
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,170
honey now I'm gonna have to try to not

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,419
think about the fact that it's bee vomit

98
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,270
yeah it's straight up bee puke so bees

99
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,650
your pukes pretty tasty yeah and it's

100
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,029
got some really cool medicinal effects

101
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,449
it's way better than mine bro so they're

102
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:35,799
[Music]

103
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,599
side note side note totally random side

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,430
note Jelly Belly has created some new

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,450
flavors and one of their new flavors is

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,280
vomit yeah right who wants it vomit

107
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,740
flavored jelly Belly that's not funny

108
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,779
so these for these flies these bees are

109
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,280
gluing and they're collecting they could

110
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:53,049
be collecting the male pollen from these

111
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,789
male plants and flying back and creating

112
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,120
honey out of that that is very feasible

113
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,129
do I do not see how they could land on a

114
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,959
female cannabis plant with trichomes on

115
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,180
it and gather trichomes and fly enough

116
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,379
trichomes back to the hive to make

117
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,870
cannabis honey that doesn't seem

118
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,699
feasible to me well I don't see them

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,740
purposefully gathering the Tritons

120
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,539
either so any sort of Trico gathering

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,759
it's gonna be incidental or accidental

122
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,560
yeah completely and I think that it's

123
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,579
private you ever been trimming and rub

124
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,978
your eye super yet

125
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:23,779
it burns we spent like the first half

126
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:25,639
hour at a new trim gig warning the dude

127
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,049
the new people not to do that right and

128
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,560
somebody will do it somebody's brother

129
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,389
time it happens it's a the plant gives

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,300
off pheromones sometimes people have

131
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,098
allergy style reactions to it and

132
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,509
sometimes your face gets at you and your

133
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,788
chairman that's just a thing and so you

134
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:41,930
rub your eye and it burns you only make

135
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:44,029
that mistake once it's like getting

136
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,590
maced and it sucks oh you can't make it

137
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:47,239
quit because your fingers are sticky cuz

138
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:50,839
you're trimming so you got to deal with

139
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,668
it I think that the pH was far too hot

140
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,019
for these bees to be able to handle and

141
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,519
I think it would burn the bees I think

142
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,079
they would just be like nah [ __ ] this I

143
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,818
don't want anything to do with it see I

144
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,098
don't know if it would be too acidic or

145
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,810
to like burn them but I think that this

146
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:04,788
thickness of the tackiness would annoy

147
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,829
the [ __ ] that's definitely part of what

148
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:09,139
the trichome is designed to do it's too

149
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:11,508
partially to keep those bugs away from

150
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,240
there so you could see this totally bit

151
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:17,240
like this there may be serious benefits

152
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,278
to bees collecting male cannabis pollen

153
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,009
and turning that into honey but it's

154
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:23,990
definitely not like weed honey is as

155
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,939
advertised right it's a very cool

156
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,639
marketing ploy it is a very cool video

157
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:30,500
but I think it is inaccurate I think

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,930
it's misleading and I don't think you're

159
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,699
getting THC honey i I want to see this

160
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,408
happen you know what I mean I want it to

161
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,939
be somebody said earlier they ain't

162
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:40,968
gonna do it on the honor system I want

163
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,620
to watch them make this honey and then I

164
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:45,829
want to watch the bees do their thing

165
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,959
and I want to take that honey to a lab

166
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:49,399
and let's deep he'll test that honey for

167
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,899
me and see what type of cannabinoids are

168
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,098
in there well that's what I was thinking

169
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,528
when we were kind of talking about this

170
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:56,180
before the show is for that to happen we

171
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:59,028
would have to bring this little homie to

172
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,000
Colorado with his bees and his cannabis

173
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,528
plants because that's the only place on

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,060
the planet where we could really collect

175
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:06,288
and lab test that in a controlled way

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,769
without him going to jail immediately

177
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:12,050
after I think you can do it in Spain man

178
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,778
he's in France so he's just a boarder

179
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,848
jump boy I think spins grow home girl I

180
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:18,500
haven't looked at it from anything Spain

181
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:20,060
cares because they have spannabis and

182
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,560
there's a hillside in Spain I forget the

183
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,788
name of the place I feel bad that I

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,288
can't remember the name of the region

185
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:25,759
but there's a small region in Spain

186
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:27,620
where they do not care about cannabis

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,960
growing there a lot of people go there

188
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,819
they might have the ability to grow but

189
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,888
do they have the access to the same test

190
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,930
and kind of slabs that we do that's a

191
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,790
very good question because both in the

192
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,439
same area are one of the things that

193
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,689
make Colorado's cannabis market so

194
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,569
awesome dude come to Colorado bring your

195
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,740
bees bring your bring your gear we'll do

196
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,389
what we got to do we want to see this

197
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,970
happen we want to test your bees you've

198
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,620
heard honey do did on a mildly related

199
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,000
note the dude in Oregon that's doing the

200
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,009
Hogs no yeah you know how here the waste

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,689
from the cannabis grow you have to do

202
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,560
specific stuff with it so it doesn't end

203
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,259
up right

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,939
teenagers hands or whatever we ground up

205
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,889
into little tiny pieces run through a

206
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,418
wood chipper and then mixed with other

207
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:13,129
product right a shop up in Oregon

208
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,589
found a hog farmer to take care of a

209
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,079
farm perfect and so they take all that

210
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:20,029
plant material and I I'm not exactly

211
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,620
sure what he what the farmer does to it

212
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,909
between picking it up from the shop and

213
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,090
dropping it off with the pigs but I'm

214
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,949
assuming it's not much and they chat out

215
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,819
on that as a primary food source for

216
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,620
most of that life

217
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,450
that's the Rocky Mountain worm company

218
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,219
in Colorado Springs has a deal worked

219
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,430
out with the very well-known vape pen

220
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,930
company open they grow their products in

221
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,489
their warehouse they chopped down their

222
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:43,549
plants and the waste from their plants

223
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,889
is then it's mixed properly so that it's

224
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,539
meed compliant and the media's approve

225
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,970
this transaction they send all of the

226
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:51,199
waste to the Rocky Mountain worm company

227
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,778
and the Rocky Mountain worm companies

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,850
feeding that back to their worms and the

229
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:58,039
worms compost that and then the Rocky

230
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,230
Mountain worm company in turn sells

231
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,778
their worm castings at a discount back

232
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,209
to open vapes groves brew and it goes

233
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:06,860
full circle yeah so it's getting reused

234
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,629
and reef ed back to the worms it's kind

235
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,190
of keeping it a little more eco-friendly

236
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:12,350
we need to learn as growers as

237
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,209
professional responsible growers it is

238
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,709
time to figure out how to reduce our

239
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,599
carbon footprint I don't know how to do

240
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,969
that very well well a lot of the places

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,149
the the laws around cannabis make that

242
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,560
specific topic incredibly brutal right

243
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,600
in Boulder I think they have to run

244
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,789
solar to offset all of their electricity

245
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,300
or something passed a law and Boulder

246
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:34,069
saying 104 you marijuana businesses had

247
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,139
to be a hundred percent energy neutral

248
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,410
which means they can't consume any power

249
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,088
they don't generate and immediately

250
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:43,159
after passing that law they real

251
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,050
how unenforceable and I are not

252
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,448
unenforceable but unfeasible it was to

253
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:52,669
require that immediately and so they've

254
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:53,958
been given some time to upgrade but it's

255
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:56,740
one of the things that made puebla so

256
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,938
popular is that we allow green house

257
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,198
denver does not agree now this boulder

258
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:02,269
does not allow the green house and we

259
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:04,578
have the prime green house area here his

260
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,019
perfect green house country to beautiful

261
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:09,049
country here to grow cannabis or hemp

262
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,480
yep we designated a whole bunch of water

263
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,338
it just kind of set it aside for you

264
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,749
know that's all will lease to marijuana

265
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:17,360
grows at the beginning of this we've

266
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:18,829
barely touched that number cool so

267
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,778
there's a ton of that still kind of in

268
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,919
reserve even with the industry as big as

269
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:23,539
it is down here that's one of the

270
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,338
hardest things to do is to get the water

271
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,958
rights once you get something set up you

272
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,209
think is a water a lawyer there was

273
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,058
something nobody thought of until about

274
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,679
a year and a half two years ago when we

275
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:34,549
finally finished the rules and regs

276
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,058
process

277
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:40,039
you can't just hammer out a well and go

278
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:41,568
to town down here in southern colorado

279
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,370
we've got a lot of rules when it comes

280
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:44,659
to water here yeah well they know they

281
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,428
know that big commercial growers are

282
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:47,870
coming and trying to use up the water

283
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,409
and they want to keep it for you and i

284
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,970
had a drink

285
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,350
which was yeah you know they've got a

286
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,928
good water plan down here so all that's

287
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,659
taken care of the it's one of the more

288
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:58,399
recent anti pot talking points is how

289
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:01,428
much water the plant drinks or how much

290
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,259
energy growing an indoor cost is like

291
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:06,649
well you know if you didn't prohibit it

292
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:09,318
in 46 of the 50 states more of it would

293
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,360
be grown under the sun will be using

294
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,740
significantly less power to produce all

295
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
this if we could just grow it outdoors

296
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,818
like a normal crab but oh no

297
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,399
when do we vote on the city elections

298
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:22,428
for 200 and 300 and the presidential

299
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,129
okay november november november 8 we

300
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:26,568

episode we need to guide people on what

304
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:35,088
to vote on locally specifically do that

305
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:36,799
in a whole nother show we'll do a little

306
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,110
segment on it just for them what's the

309
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,249
day for people to submit ballot issue

00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:48,258
paperwork so the final election ballots

311
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:50,000

now so we'll have all the final

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,089
information for november you know we

314
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,549
could do so that's perfect

315
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,200
perfect

316
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,599
we'll do an episode to teach you guys

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,520
locally what to vote for because the

318
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,320
wording is confusing I do agree with

319
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,088
that there's gonna be it's more way more

320
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,100
than one question it's not just via

321
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,930
yes-or-no vote yes for we vote no

322
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,360
against wheat it's gonna be much more

323
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:11,399
complicated than that yeah all right so

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,490
this episode I want to put this back on

325
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,169
some some educational topics

326
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:21,990
yes back on some rails Mike's had a

327
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:23,549
headache he's really his color came back

328
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,750
he's more relaxed I can see that the

329
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,519
headache has kind of gone away a little

330
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,708
bit you feeling better bro I'm feeling a

331
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,669
lot better where's the proper container

332
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,278
because I got three of them to look

333
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:38,059
alike the product I'm consuming right

334
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:42,659
now is three percent THC 1.3 percent CBD

335
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:44,729
38 point nine nine percent CBD a and six

336
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:49,278
there thirty six point three two percent

337
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:52,920
THC a and an additional six percent CBG

338
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:56,309
so this has got a a bizarrely wide range

339
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,649
of cannabinoids in it and really get on

340
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,519
headaches other things pain inflammation

341
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,480
as well

342
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,578
what kind of hash would you call that

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,759
what kind of um it depends what

344
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:09,778
temperature it is it's intended as a

345
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,370
shatter at about 65 degrees it's a

346
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:16,200
pretty nice shatter it shatters real

347
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,209
nice it's 70 it's really sticky taffy

348
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,009
okay you take two pieces you pull it

349
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,719
apart it just kind of stretches I want

350
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,100
you to try to get it out of there it can

351
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,519
be a little tricky to get a dab out of

352
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,589
there it it above like 65 so what he's

353
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,838
talking about is a smokeable concentrate

354
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,630
it's some hash some chatter with a

355
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,880
pretty good CBD to THC ratio yeah it's

356
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,528
about 50/50 you could tell Mike was

357
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,299
hurtin about 20 minutes ago he had a

358
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:41,220
pretty good headache and he told me that

359
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,078
I put on his headphones like all right

360
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,420
dude let's record a podcast so the CBD

361
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,739
definitely reduced of the pain and your

362
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,750
headache and it improved your attitude

363
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,028
because of that oh yeah I feel a hundred

364
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,370
percent better now that I've put

365
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:56,669
something that's half and half THC CBD

366
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,289
into my system for the day my knees feel

367
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,159
better my neck the tension in my neck

368
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:01,078
feels better

369
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,299
I had a wicked headache when I got here

370
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,859
folks that was uh we're sitting at the

371
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,479
table kind of catching up and dabbing

372
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,370
and I'm basically just staring at

373
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,860
we'll rub in my eyes and my temples cuz

374
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,389
it hurts so bad I'm thinking I might not

375
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,190
podcast tonight I might just have to

376
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,399
bail after a day or two and go home so

377
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,210
I'm hurtin and the addition to some CBD

378
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,279
into my world has reset that completely

379
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:27,090
I've been a big fan of CBD for a long

380
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,740
time it's good for what ails you I'll

381
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,410
put it that way that's the truth

382
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,810
one thing that I and I've said on the

383
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:35,490
show I'm not a huge smoker of CBD I

384
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:38,250
don't use a lot of CBD product when I

385
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,200
smoke I prefer a nice THC Head buzz I

386
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,559
want to get high I want to make my head

387
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,210
spin

388
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,069
I want to get confused I want to get

389
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,660
goofy only a talkative that's what a

390
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,720
good sativa does to me when I smoke too

391
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:51,449
much CBD I honestly just get lazy and it

392
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,120
kind of ruins my high ah yeah I'm not

393
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,910
stoned right now and that's I took four

394
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,980
not all THC dabs here a minute ago

395
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:00,419
and I had a nice little buzz going on

396
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,920
but right before the show I didn't want

397
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,759
my headache to come back so I took two

398
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,860
more half and a half THC CBD dabs and it

399
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:15,870

normal shatter like THC or sativas my

454

462
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,220

469
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,849

00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,148
those CBD dabs I was like I haven't felt

475
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,038
this good since before I hit my head

476
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:04,259
like it really did something to me it

477
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,819

stuff and like dad this like damn it

479

everyday it is gummy it really did help

480
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:18,120
I found a good half THC half CBD mix

481
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:20,819
about oh maybe two years ago and it was

482
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,798
really hard to come by back then but

483
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:27,210
I've got a lot of inflammation in like

484
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,940
my knees and my neck where it's just for

485
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,009
one stupid medical reason or another

486
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,298
the bones grind on each other firm and

487
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,159
the tissue gets swollen

488
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,710
we're both overs you're like six four

489
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,539

490
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:49,079
weigh good to 30 I'm guessing I'm not

491
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:51,000
good at goodbyes that reaction I'm right

492
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,970
about 200 pounds most of the time these

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,509
knees bro God our knees get there's so

494
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,370
much leverage sizes legs how many times

495
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,730
have you stood up into like a heating

496
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,668
duct

497
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,889
oh yeah and just cramped you're next

498
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,440
when I busted my head I really jerked my

499
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:09,329
neck back completely so that retinol and

500
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,159
I've been in car accidents I grew up in

501
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:14,579
Colorado there's a lot of fun stuff here

502
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:17,789
that you can tumble down cartwheels with

503
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,288
skis on releasing on my feet was one of

504
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:22,829
the really fun ones that led to no

505
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:26,009
cartilage in either knee icicles as a

506
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:28,168
kid in California but though the end

507
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,909
results all this trauma over the years

508
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,980
of having fun in Colorado is that

509
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,929
there's a lot of inflammation and a lot

510
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,558
of swelling into places that press on

511
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,360
nerves and then that causes phantom

512
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,798
nerve pain are basically the same stuff

513
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,079
amputees get with like they lose a

514
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:48,119
finger and then the finger tingles or

515
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:50,730
hurts those nerves create or or make up

516
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,469
or feel that they're getting signals

517
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,808
they're not really getting and it can

518
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,269
feel like it's tingling or tickling or

519
00:19:54,808 --> 00:20:01,349
it can feel like it's on fire or stuck

520
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:03,929
in a car door or it'll go numb and when

521
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,849
I first stumbled on medical marijuana

522
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,909
that was one of the things I liked is it

523
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:10,740
would help me ignore that sensation but

524
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:14,220
it wasn't until I found something that

525
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,230
was a good ratio with THC CBD that I

526
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,720
really started to attack that

527
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,210
inflammation and bring it down to a

528
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,558
point where it doesn't hurt anymore like

529
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,730
it's hard to explain to somebody when

530
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,769
you're at work and they're like why are

531
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,019
you rubbing your hand and it's like well

532
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:31,798
because the the three small fingers are

533
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,028
numb and my thumb and my index finger

534
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,339
feel like they're stuck in a car door

535
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:37,169
and it was like that when I woke up and

536
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,558
I can't make it go away but like which

537
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,000
Jackie did you want to try on it's just

538
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,529
one of those things that sucks that you

539
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,150
just have to deal with until I

540
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:47,490
found something with there really help

541
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,320
that inflammation I was just taking

542
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,299
random pills that the doctor gave me and

543
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:52,559
going to the chiropractor and the pills

544
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,750
didn't do a [ __ ] thing other than

545
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,409
mess with my stomach in my liver but the

546
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:00,809
chiropractor was helping some but when I

547
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,550
found something that's half THC half CBD

548
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,250
that inflammation really started to calm

549
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:09,750
down and I started having lower pain

550
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,420
days lower crazy sensation days and then

551
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,849
slowly but surely I started getting

552
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,910
pain-free days and do those first couple

553
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:19,709
pain-free days were the dude I was

554
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,029
looking was a teenager yeah like it

555
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,799
never happened

556
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,859
yes your endocannabinoid system back in

557
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,529
line and now that the rec industry has

558
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,329
progressed where it is there are several

559
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:33,569
places in town where I can go in and

560
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:35,549
pick up half THC F CBD concentrates and

561
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:37,319
like when I get home from a end of a

562
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:40,139
long day my knees are swollen a little

563
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,639
bit my feet hurt my back hurts I've

564
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,710
eaten enough bulls to ship for the day

565
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,710
and I'm in kind of a foul mood two or

566
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,420
three dabs of that will have me feeling

567
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,670
like none of that happened physically

568
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:55,470
and it's just a wonder again for the day

569
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,850
now CBD for the win yeah CBD ramble no I

570
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:02,009
love it that's right that's why I

571
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:04,379
brought to Doug who's been on the

572
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:05,819
episode before - I saw Doug today shout

573
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,520
out the Doug Doug it looks great it's

574
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:10,649
good to see you doing well um CBD has

575
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,960
changed his life a hundred percent right

576
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,030
yes medical marijuana has saved Doug's

577
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,220
life for sure I don't know if I honestly

578
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,869
I and it's it's hard to think that stuff

579
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,789
like this right now because we've lost a

580
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,169
lot of people this year but I don't know

581
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:24,869
if Doug could still be here without

582
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,060
medical marijuana you know mentally

583
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,829
spiritually and physically Doug would

584
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,069
not be the same person without medical

585
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:33,659
marijuana I mean III saw some of the

586
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:36,029
same stuff I was going through in his

587
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,269
world like I mean listeners if you don't

588
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,500
have a lot of pet like physical pain in

589
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,349
your life or if you've never really been

590
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:46,829
injured for a while it's kind of hard to

591
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,750
understand what people who do have nerve

592
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:50,909
damage and pain like that go through and

593
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,809
it's the best way I can describe it is

594
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:57,028
it's like a sound and it gets louder and

595
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,278
louder and louder and it gets louder

596
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:01,409
the world around you gets smaller and

597
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,638
that sound presses in on the world and

598
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,939
there are some days where there's

599
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:08,668
nothing but that sound like it's just

600
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:10,079
pain it doesn't matter that if you don't

601
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:12,419
pick up the phone you're not gonna have

602
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:14,489
a job later it doesn't matter that

603
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,619
you've got to go to the bathroom it

604
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:18,568
doesn't matter that you had something

605
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:21,509
really important to do that day that you

606
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:23,128
have to get up and go do now for or it's

607
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:25,128
you know you're gonna lose it forever it

608
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:28,019
doesn't matter all there is is the pain

609
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:29,578
and you'll do anything to get away from

610
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,588
it or make it stop for a while you'll

611
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:33,358
give people of ridiculous sums of money

612
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:36,808
because they claim to have a treatment

613
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:37,828
that works and for the most part nothing

614
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:39,209
helps

615
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:41,548
like I was wearing a thing that

616
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:44,849
electrocuted me slowly like a TENS unit

617
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:46,888
and it works okay for some issues but

618
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:49,198
for mine it was literally just an

619
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:50,968
electrical shock that scrambled the pain

620
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:53,429
and pulse on the way to my brain dam

621
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:56,578
like that was the best that Western

622
00:23:53,429 --> 00:24:02,579
science had for me and then one day I

623
00:23:56,578 --> 00:24:04,078
hit some high CBD hash and about half an

624
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:06,898
hour later I was like wait a second

625
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:08,308
nothing hurts I'm and I kind of drum my

626
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:09,838
both my hands on the table and I was

627
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,908
like and I can feel all my fingers and

628
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:13,528
none of them hurt like what is that

629
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:17,789
where did that come from where'd that

630
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:20,989
guy with that vial of station but yeah

631
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:23,038
it's CBD is absolutely wonderful

632
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:24,808
and a lot of people are starting to

633
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,759
figure it out so much so that there's a

634
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:29,969
lot of scam and fake [ __ ] around yeah

635
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,949
unfortunately that Chinese imported CBD

636
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:35,849
[ __ ] it's not you're not buying stuff

637
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:37,979
with a lab test on it from a very

638
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:39,838
accredited retailer you don't know what

639
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:44,999
you're getting I'm I'm sorry to inform

640
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:47,308
you yeah unfortunately it's there's a

641
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:50,759
lot of research going on in to CBD right

642
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:52,229
now hopefully in the next ten years we

643
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,318
know a lot more about its medical

644
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:58,139
applications but I can vouch for its

645
00:24:55,318 --> 00:25:00,778
ability to calm a headache and lower

646
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:02,938
inflammation and swelling in your nerves

647
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:04,979
or around your nerves and your joints so

648
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:08,669
that those pain signals aren't just

649
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:10,528
ability produces vomiting and nausea for

650
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,800
sure I smoked some CBD it'll take that

651
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:12,869
away

652
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,659
it suppresses seizures that's something

653
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:17,279
we've talked about on the podcast before

654
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,290
it'll make you not have convulsions and

655
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,539
seizures hopefully that's like the most

656
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,670
part of everyone but it's there's

657
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:27,059
several different forms of epilepsy

658
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,039
right that THC work on and that CBD work

659
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:32,669
on and then that the two together work

660
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,000
on that's a good all that sexy - oh yeah

661
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:38,670
it'll stop here it doesn't stop it will

662
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,250
slow down your PTSD and your nightmares

663
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,070
and your thoughts if you have PTSD I

664
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,859
always sleep amazingly well when I've

665
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:48,990
been consumed yes I hopes with anxiety

666
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,509
oh it's an anti-inflammatory we talked

667
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,490
about that it's an anti antioxidant it

668
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,079
helps with degenerative disorders which

669
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,779
is pretty cool it's act as a protective

670
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,909
hand side tumor it'll it'll and will not

671
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:02,519
destroy your tumors I think you need THC

672
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:05,870
to destroy it - there's slow a tumor for

673
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:09,629
sure um there's a lot of very very very

674
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:14,219
recent cancer research on THC and CBD

675
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:16,860
and CBD slows tumor growth majorly is

676
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,130
what they're seeing in mice trials which

677
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,719
is huge if if we can slow tumor growth

678
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,150
that gives us a better chance to fight

679
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,339
it yes yeah the good news to that corner

680
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:30,060
or that equation is that THC has been

681
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:32,849
shown to kill it um which is kinda the

682
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,619
you know the the first real medical

683
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:37,859
research into Rick Simpson oil style

684
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:40,799
products that would be it concentrates

685
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:44,969
of both that's why those are so

686
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,740
effective and I'm a little bit baked

687
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,110
from that last tiny dab I'm gonna take

688
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,670
it down ramble on but as the medical

689
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,859
research that we're starting to get I

690
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,860
mean it really isn't it symphonies its

691
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:57,359
bitsy folks I'm not saying that if you

692
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,949
have cancer and you find some of this

693
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,069
you can cure yourself real easy that's

694
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,110
not what what I'm saying here but um the

695
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:07,700
research is promising and honestly in

696
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:11,250
our lifetimes we might see legitimate

697
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,840
packaged perfectly dosed you've got this

698
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,660
kind of cancer we're gonna start you on

699
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:18,629
this much THC this much CBD style try

700
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,090
it's exactly in our lifetime which would

701
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,190
be oh that would make me so happy

702
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:24,990
did you smell that Dad that I just took

703
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,700
little bit oh that smells it tastes so

704
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,009
good I tasted in a minute ago that's the

705
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,539
Tirpitz pineapple jacket yeah the nug

706
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:33,150
run chatter that was delicious

707
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,309
yeah man another thing I wanted to

708
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,200
mention that CBD does it's an

709
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,419
antidepressant which you know I think it

710
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,009
it's got its own antidepressant

711
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,110
properties but also if a dude's not

712
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,609
hurting every day that's gonna work as

713
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,889
an antidepressant if you're not having

714
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:48,149
PTSD symptoms and panic attacks you're

715
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,820
gonna be less depressed

716
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,830
I mean honestly most days when I wake up

717
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,309
and I'm not hurt and it feels like my

718
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:56,609
birthday

719
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,379
still cuz they're pretty rare most days

720
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:00,269
I wake up at least a little stiff a

721
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,610
little sore something somewhere screwed

722
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,440
you're only getting older I now write

723
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,879
well though when I was a teenager I had

724
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,140
more than one doctor go if you don't

725
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,120
knock this [ __ ] off it's gonna hurt when

726
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,520
you're thirty yeah and I was like shut

727
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,349
up put a cast on it yeah but I got [ __ ]

728
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,160
to do you gotta go where my roller

729
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:19,259
blades go cuz I got like I was a

730
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,420
teenager in Colorado in the 90s we were

731
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,129
still free to like ride our bikes off

732
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,420
roofs and stuff remember like before

733
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:30,510
everything was nerfed yeah we didn't get

734
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,519
trophies when our team didn't win in the

735
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:36,690
future it was the last generation that

736
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:39,869
really got that yeah we're the same age

737
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,670
I was right there with you but I

738
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:43,529
remember more than one doctor notice

739
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,650
gonna hurt when you're thirty if they

740
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,569
were all right it does but the days that

741
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,540
are paying free most of those I can

742
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:52,889
accredit to last night I was I was

743
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,099
hurting a little I knew I was hurt and

744
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,540
so I consumed a whole lot of THC CBD

745
00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:00,539
concentrate instead with my normal mix

746
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:04,519
of predominantly THC flower and shatter

747
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:10,349
and I wake up feeling a lot better

748
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:12,509
really restful sleep and really really

749
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:14,819
nice work on the inflammation while I

750
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:17,879
sleep one thing we should totally

751
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:20,309
mentioned is CBD buyers by itself will

752
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,140
not get you high no you can consume a

753
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:23,579
lot of CBD and you may get a little grin

754
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,800
but I don't think you're gonna get like

755
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:29,129
any psychedelic psychoactive effect it's

756
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,169
not a high the the mood improvement is

757
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,480
like you were saying when the pain goes

758
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,000
away your mood goes up a thousand times

759
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,720
like it I mean if you don't know what

760
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,788
I'm talking about

761
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,409
think about getting a bee sting when you

762
00:29:38,788 --> 00:29:42,658
get that stinger pulled out or a

763
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:44,520
splinter pulled out or you've got a big

764
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:47,850
painful zit that finally pops like in

765
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,700
that relief of pressure imagine that

766
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:52,439
like through your whole arm like if your

767
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,960
whole arm felt like it was on fire and

768
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,380
then one moment it stopped feeling like

769
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,819
that it just felt like your arm again

770
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,159
the sensation is incredible when we

771
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:06,240
finally get there you know how well it's

772
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:10,140
working another thing that we can talk

773
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,538
about is CBD will reduce the effects of

774
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,220
THC so if you're a little too high if

775
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:16,408
you've had too many dads if you're new

776
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,880
and you take a big giant dab a THC and

777
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:20,190
you're just spinning you're [ __ ] up

778
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,510
you take a little dab of CBD in it will

779
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,669
calm you down a little bit it'll balance

780
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:25,679
out your high there's some company that

781
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:29,038
made a product they work on rescue pills

782
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,769
it was just the CBD capsule CBD filled

783
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,509
gel cap that's pretty cool um so yeah if

784
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,740
your buddy took too many dabs and

785
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:36,990
they're freaking out a little bit just

786
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,390
hand them this and it's good you know

787
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,339
good mug for half an hour wait for this

788
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:45,210
to kick in some Doritos and you'd be

789
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:47,519
just fine a friend of mine makes for a

790
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:51,029
relative he's a carrier before he makes

791
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,319
CBD capsules and he does something to

792
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,109
the oil to make it a little more

793
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,970
bioavailable and I was taking those at

794
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,918
night for a while I had a few and oh

795
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:03,569
good lord that I feel wonderful thanks

796
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,429
dad I'm just pain-free and and just in a

797
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,899
really really nice mood it was really

798
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,840
nice there are a couple of companies

799
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,309
that are making CBD dog treats which i

800
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,779
think is really cool because a lot of

801
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:15,269
the Shepherd breeds are known for their

802
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:17,129
dysplasia and hip problems there's a

803
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:18,779
shepherd dog that stayed at my house for

804
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,700
a little while now and he gets some CBD

805
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,319
treats occasionally and he seems to be a

806
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,610
happy little dog doesn't seem to cause

807
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,319
him any problems and it's gonna keep him

808
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:30,178
pain-free keep his little hips happy

809
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:32,599
I've got a Malamute that's pushing for

810
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,330
thirteen and a half now she's almost 14

811
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:38,579
breed expect life expectancy is eight

812
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:42,000
and so her knees hurt her ankles I've

813
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:44,189
basically every joint is shot and you

814
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,630
can see when she doesn't want to go up

815
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,049
and down the stairs I've been adding a

816
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,300
little THC CBD teen sugar food

817
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,579
in the days that I added she's five

818
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,829
years younger nice you can see it

819
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,289
helping with the pain and inflammation

820
00:31:54,829 --> 00:32:00,629
uh it takes about twenty minutes half an

821
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:03,240
hour to kick in for her then you can see

822
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,680
the change overnight yeah I had five or

823
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,029
six customers come in looking for

824
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,680
something for their dogs before I

825
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,599
thought to try it and yeah I'm glad I

826
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,539
did there are companies that are making

827
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,250
specific edibles for dogs now there are

828
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,869
things available at hem stores that have

829
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,630
CBD for your dog that are made in

830
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:20,579
America with actual hemp products there

831
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,290
I can't say there's anything wrong with

832
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,470
that as long as it's made with real real

833
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:27,210
hemp or real cannabis you're basically

834
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:30,900
in a brick and mortar retailer in the

835
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:34,590
United States it has to at least contain

836
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,630
what the label says um recently the the

837
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:40,289
DEA just sent out a thing to a bunch of

838
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:41,850
CBD only companies and the internet kind

839
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,490
of freaked out was like oh they're just

840
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,869
attacking weed like they always do it it

841
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,640
was they were targeting the people that

842
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:49,709
are selling like cod fish oil and

843
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,540
calling it CBD oil because people don't

844
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,039
know any better and you can't take this

845
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,799
stuff to lab and get it tested as a

846
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,329
civilian but yeah you're just getting

847
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,710
scammed out of money on the internet so

848
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:02,189
be careful if you're ordering online

849
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,960
folks with this the if you've got a

850
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,000
number of different ailments

851
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,920
you should get online and check out to

852
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,539
see if there's any research on what THC

853
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,490
and CBD can do for those for your

854
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,440
specific ailment yeah and then check out

855
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,240
the laws in your state and see if and

856
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,009
where you can get this stuff and if you

857
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,589
have to come take a vacation in Colorado

858
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,809
I see a lot of the people doing exactly

859
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:25,289
that they come they visit at one of our

860
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:27,839
rec stores and a good rec store will

861
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:31,049
have a decent selection of CBD products

862
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,089
at this point they might not have a huge

863
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,980
selection or a wide selection but I

864
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:36,779
should have some you can go to more than

865
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,210

looking for as much as you can and then

905
00:34:55,019 --> 00:35:00,690
narrow your list that way because I mean

906
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,130
the industry is weird right now and you

907
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:05,099
never know when somebody's gonna walk in

908
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,930
and say give me all of that so what's on

909
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,068
their menu might not have anything to do

910
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:10,289
with what's on their store shelf and

911
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:11,429
brightest moment it might just be stuff

912
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:13,469
that's been on the store shelf in the

913
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,578
last 30 days I was shopping at green and

914
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:17,429
healthy the other day and I was

915
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,930
frustrated because I wanted I bought

916
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,940
something and the guy behind me was

917
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:24,568
frustrated because I had purchased all

918
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,858
of it and he said I want that and she

919
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:27,449
had to say it's gone and he said why is

920
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:29,400
it on the list and she's like he just

921
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:30,779
bought all of it sorry so that's how

922
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,010
quickly she could sell out I bought her

923
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,690
notes and I cleaned him out I took the

924
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,700
bottom of that I watched a dude buy a

925
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,550
hundred and sixty things of hard candies

926
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:42,689
once I'm Jesus um and it was just like

927
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:45,690
okay let me get you a box and sweep all

928
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,309
of these into the box and like for the

929
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,389
new the rest of the week we had to tell

930
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:49,739
people sorry we're out of that

931
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,969
particular product line and there were

932
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,539
likes there's something wrong with it

933
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:56,549
it's like no it was something amazing

934
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,079
with it apparently honestly every every

935
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,700
month I've worked in a dispensary that's

936
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,800
happened with at least one product line

937
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,328
once I mean sometimes it's only the last

938
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,390
eight or ten or twenty units or whatever

939
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:08,099
but it happens I used to go to you went

940
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:10,679
with me we went to the clinic in Denver

941
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,690
and they had Durbin poison wax yep

942
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,299
and they had vortex wax I

943
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,710
loved from the clinic on Mexico in

944
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,880
Denver it's still open they don't have

945
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,318
these products anymore they've changed

946
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,099
their game but they used to have this

947
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:25,619
looks three two half years ago the

948
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,079
vortex tasted like cranberries and dirty

949
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,760
feet and rotten fruit I don't know why

950
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,800
you liked that feet smell oh man I just

951
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,810
love that in my weed but the high that

952
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,640
he gave me I couldn't focus on anything

953
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:38,219
it made my eyes jump around like I was

954
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:40,799
on a bumpy road like it was really crazy

955
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,389
and that durbin poison just I love the

956
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,430
flavor of good urban poison wax and that

957
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:46,078
head-high is just so amazing so back in

958
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:47,608
the day we'd go to the clinic and I

959
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,079
would save up as much money as I could

960
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:50,159
afford to save up and I'd walk in there

961
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,150
and I'd say how much did that Durbin

962
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,039
poison do you have and they'd say

963
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,900
there's about 14 grams and I'd say I'll

964
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,159
take it and then I'd say how much of

965
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,930
that vortex do you have and they'd

966
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,269
usually have somewhere between 14 and 28

967
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:01,649
grams I would buy it I would clean it

968
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,880
out the guy behind me would be like oh

969
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,260
yeah he brought a lot of that I want

970
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,900
something they be like sorry he bought

971
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,450

on the difference between strain and

1028
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,750
strand strands are ropes or fibers

1029
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:29,279
strains are different varieties of

1030
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,889
cannabis if you want to be technical you

1031
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,350
can call it a varietal or a cultivar but

1032
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:37,559
let's let's go with strain instead of

1033
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:50,969
strand as a start you guys it's a try

00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,268
didn't realize I've watched this video

1079
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,099
several times he [ __ ] up where he said

1080
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:54,178
it's good to use before and after the

1081
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,829
fight he shouldn't I said before the

1082
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,289
fight [ __ ] up right there buddy but

1083
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:00,179
still well there there's he might be an

1084
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,739
atomic trouble for doing that yeah

1085
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,410
that's that's what I wanted to talk

1086
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:08,068
about him glad you said that it's uh the

1087
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:13,458
specific rules bar cannabis consumption

1088
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:16,679
period until six hours after the fight

1089
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:18,268
is what I was reading in random press

1090
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,920
coverage of this I like I don't follow

1091
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,278
the sport it makes sense in all of their

1092
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,199
rules

1093
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:24,539
if you catch that from my intro to this

1094
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,959
story is that you Sado rules or is that

1095
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:35,869
rules from the local governing sporting

1096
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:35,868
agency those rules with an s rules

1097
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:41,518
whose rules they are but MMA fighters

1098
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:43,768
can't use any sort of cannabis product

1099
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:45,598
until or any sort of banned substance

1100
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:47,129
which marijuana or cannabis products

1101
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,599
would be on the list until six hours

1102
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,160
after the fight I'm pretty sure I

1103
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,229
already know your answer here but do you

1104
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,889
think a dude that just spent twenty five

1105
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:55,288
minutes of

1106
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:57,088
getting kicked in the dick and punched

1107
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:59,069
in the face should be allowed to take a

1108
00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:00,690
couple of rips off a CBD vape pen at the

1109
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:03,929
end of the night almost the most

1110
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,358
assuredly I'd offer him a DES dab of

1111
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:07,828
this wonderful half an out all this

1112
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,778
grand that's left over if he wanted

1113
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:11,759
money after being like that anything

1114
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:13,739
that's gonna help you recover faster and

1115
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:16,528
you with that level of trauma is

1116
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,630
encouraged by me he says it reduces

1117
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:19,920
inflammation and swelling and that dude

1118
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,910
that his face looked like a

1119
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,108
jack-o'-lantern

1120
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:27,028
it did and honestly I incur a plot his

1121
00:43:25,108 --> 00:43:29,130
use of anything other than heavy

1122
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:30,929
narcotics is what these guys are usually

1123
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,519
isn't that what they usually throw at

1124
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:34,288
him you know I don't I don't know what

1125
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:36,838
they do to deal with the pain at the end

1126
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:39,420
of that but I did make a joke he said

1127
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,650
I'm going to a party and Conor McGregor

1128
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,559
is going to the hospital I don't know

1129
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,499
how accurate that was because he get his

1130
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,670
face punched in I I can't even talk

1131
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,689
about who I feel like won that fight

1132
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,670
that doesn't matter at all in this

1133
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,499
podcast that's not what we're here for

1134
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,930
alright I didn't see it all I know is

1135
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:57,238
that Nate Diaz took a hell of a beating

1136
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:59,518
and that during the press conference he

1137
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:00,809
was ripping a CBD and blatantly ripping

1138
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:03,988
it - he looked took like two or three

1139
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:06,839
big fat rips off of it so he didn't

1140
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:08,880
cough like I do yeah right no he took it

1141
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,389
like a champ he doesn't smoke cigarettes

1142
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,420
all day bro I thought that was the key

1143
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,949
to his success was tobacco yes what

1144
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,139
makes him the enemy if I make some tough

1145
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:20,608
as nails where the nickname wheezy comes

1146
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,788
from right yeah they call him young

1147
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:26,460
wheezy so I feel like this dude should I

1148
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:28,019
think I feel like every athlete I feel

1149
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,619
like almost everybody should be allowed

1150
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:33,689
to consume see everybody why not let's

1151
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:37,349
consume CBD eticket was about last night

1152
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:40,940
the new episode that aired was a medical

1153
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:43,470
marijuana use in the NFL to deal with

1154
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,298
the chronic concussion syndrome or

1155
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:48,358
whatever it's called no one helps I'm a

1156
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:50,670
victim of a head injury and I know we

1157
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:53,338
talked about that 42 minutes ago yep

1158
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,349
that definitely that CBD changed my life

1159
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:58,409
and it helped me get out of my funk that

1160
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,239
I had wasn't focused on CBD but that's

1161
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,759
sort of what they were inching at is a

1162
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,470
part of the story that were telling was

1163
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:06,298
THC and CBD are both neural protections

1164
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,719
my next question was going to be do you

1165
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:10,139
think

1166
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,809
cannabis use is a performance-enhancing

1167
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:16,559
drug

1168
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:18,420
what's this performance fighting kicking

1169
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,049
people of fighting UFC fighting how

1170
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,019
about football

1171
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,390
no not performance-enhancing at all how

1172
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,630
about recovery enhancing how about

1173
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:29,069
basketball no no I'm trying to play

1174
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,920
devil's advocate here how about video

1175
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:35,940
games yeah yeah I feel like when I smoke

1176
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,650
if I in a long time there's a lot of

1177
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,500
things I would put it on the list

1178
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,300
see then in my mind since I am so

1179
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,530
comfortable I've got a TD my mind

1180
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,970
wanders you can tell by listening to the

1181
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,880
podcast my mind is [ __ ] carts around

1182
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:49,199
all over the place man

1183
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,910
when I smoke some hash it does help me

1184
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,469
focus a little bit there's a moment

1185
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:54,029
there for the first 5-10 minutes where

1186
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:56,759
my brain just spins but once it lands

1187
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:00,000
back in its place I'm pretty well

1188
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,080
focused and so I mean I've got mild ATD

1189
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,880
as well and that's one of the things

1190
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:08,579
I've always enjoyed about cannabis is it

1191
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:10,200
helps slow down the this cool better I

1192
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,940
could shoot basketball better I could

1193
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,368
probably I don't play football I could

1194
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,619
probably throw my football with more

1195
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:20,220
accuracy after I took a couple of dabs

1196
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:22,740
ah I'm a musician I've played drums for

1197
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,239
20 years I've had drum lessons I've been

1198
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,059
on tour I've played in big bands I

1199
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,319
played in small bands sometimes smoking

1200
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,880
a little weed makes me play a little

1201
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,470
better sometimes smoking a little weed

1202
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,440
[ __ ] me up to tell you the truth so I

1203
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:38,069
don't know how like alters unless you're

1204
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,990
talking about like just helping the the

1205
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,720
athlete of the performer tune out other

1206
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:45,959
distractions and focus on the

1207
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:48,269
competition in the moment I don't see it

1208
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,710
you know making you run faster and jump

1209
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:52,079
higher and that's what I think of when I

1210
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,510
write performance an answer yourself

1211
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,460
full of blood so that your your heart

1212
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:58,320
can move more oxygen yeah taking more

1213
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,720
testosterone so I'm faster mean or lean

1214
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,910
or quicker right a steroids so that you

1215
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,088
have more physical muscle mass but like

1216
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:08,159
THC doesn't do any it doesn't able to

1217
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:09,809
kick you in the face any harder it

1218
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,149
doesn't make me give you more damn it

1219
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:15,029
helps me recover from that face kick

1220
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:18,150
faster but like that's not a performance

1221
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:20,100
enhancer that's a recovery enhancer like

1222
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,619
that's very different

1223
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,329
a UFC fighter and like we're gearing up

1224
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,429
for the fight the music's going Rogen's

1225
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:28,170
all out there oh my god this is the

1226
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:29,699
fight of the [ __ ] night everybody and

1227
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,150
Rogen's just going nuts with this bald

1228
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:32,009
head

1229
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:37,050
this is [ __ ] too much alpha brain

1230
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:38,520
does yours have a little dab fighter

1231
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,140
right on the UFC fighter I'm getting my

1232
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,849
I got my [ __ ] hand wraps on I got my

1233
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:43,500
gloves I got my tape coming on I got my

1234
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:45,089
gloves on I got my ankle wraps on I got

1235
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,320
these long chicken legs and they come

1236
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,730
out in like Ross and Jeff you got to

1237
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,860
fight in 30 seconds you ready for your

1238
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,389
pre-show dab and I'm like let's get it

1239
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,250
and they drop me like a half a gram with

1240
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:55,230
some pineapple Jack nuh grunt shatter on

1241
00:47:53,250 --> 00:48:00,809
there and I blow it out you know what I

1242
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:02,849
want to do after that not fight how do

1243
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:06,179
you medicate and want to fight at all no

1244
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:09,059
I'm just see this is how little MMA I

1245
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:10,829
watch you couldn't manipulate no you can

1246
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,659
manipulate the rake huh because they've

1247
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:17,610
they need their fingers to grapple

1248
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:19,259
I was thinking boxing style well you've

1249
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,820
got one manager holding up the smoke

1250
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,380
buddy one manager holding up the rig

1251
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,670
another manager working the nail on the

1252
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,680
car cap yeah

1253
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,450
this seems complicated for a pre-fight

1254
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:31,739
dad I would use one of those

1255
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:33,059
the Hitman hinge nails so you do with

1256
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,589
one hand I can do with my glove on I

1257
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:36,599
figure this out do the announcers

1258
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,490
microphone comes down Jeff's rig comes

1259
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,199
down I am one of those guys that if

1260
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:43,979
there's a DAB to be taken I will make

1261
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,689
sure that happens the diver that's

1262
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,490
awesome I'm glad we got to work the Nate

1263
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,619
Diaz clip into this episode that was

1264
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,239
gurus I saw that and I was so blown away

1265
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,130
I was like that's gotta be photoshopped

1266
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,559
and I clicked the volume on it and they

1267
00:48:53,130 --> 00:49:00,059
start talking about it I was blown away

1268
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:04,019
yeah shut up - Nate Diaz for

1269
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:06,659
representing cannabis and tough decision

1270
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,900
loss - he goes up all chest out proud to

1271
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:15,179
lead the way about medical cannabis no

1272
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:17,099
way politically correct or gentle no I

1273
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:18,989
just got kicked in the [ __ ] head I'm

1274
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,789
gonna smoke some CBD to help it out it's

1275
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,799
gonna help don't be mad at me that's

1276
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:24,179
cool I like that but both of those

1277
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,710
brothers are gonna end up banned from

1278
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:26,909
the UFC and banned from fighting for

1279
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,990
life if they keep playing the way that

1280
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,519
they do and that's gonna be terrible

1281
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:32,039
because I like to see their performances

1282
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,759
yes you guys it is random I'm a red

1283
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,949
large hippie Rastafari and do

1284
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,750
but I love to watch some UFC I think

1285
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,980
about it this way those dudes weigh 200

1286
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,809
pounds and they're [ __ ] Jack they've

1287
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,280
got more testosterone and then their

all got our skill um

1300
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:09,700
and it's good that they have an outlet

1301
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:12,250
and I'm a fan of em imagine don't care

1302
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:14,769
enough to pay attention I think I am

1303
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,469
accidentally an MMA fan because of Joe

1304
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:19,570
Rogan and because of Joey Diaz and it

1305
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:23,529
all rubbed off it just rubs off it's you

1306
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:25,210
Bravo Joe Rogan puts out the fight

1307
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,100
companion to him and a bunch of his

1308
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,199
friends and I also listen to fight her

1309
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,369
in the kids so that's more MMA they gets

1310
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:31,929
pumped into my head but they put out a

1311
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:33,549
fight companion where two guys from

1312
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:35,079
fighter and the kid and Eddie Bravo and

1313
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,030
Joe Rogan sit around and they watch the

1314
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:38,529
UFC and they talk about what's going on

1315
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,730
they drink beer and smoke we didn't get

1316
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,470
[ __ ] up and talk [ __ ] to each other

1317
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,719
but they're watching the UFC and they

1318
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:45,459
tell you like in the match they're like

1319
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,519
all right round three of this match

1320
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,349
we're at 29 28 27 seconds and you can

1321
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:52,960
sync up your computer and watch that

1322
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:54,219
video and so it's almost weirdly like

1323
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,050
you're hanging out with Rogan and the

1324
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,639
crew watching the fight I'll see I'll

1325
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,890
watch it if it's on some where I'm at

1326
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,379
but I don't like actively pay attention

1327
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:04,150
yeah I pay more like if I'm over at your

1328
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,650
house and it's on the it'll get more

1329
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:09,400
attention out of me than like football

1330
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:10,750
or basketball and I uh I took a little

1331
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,610
karate when I was a youngster so I've

1332
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,710
always been fascinated with that type of

1333
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,539
skills to conclusion - for several years

1334
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,610
and then pong pseudo karate for even

1335
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:21,759
longer I was just doing for us to do his

1336
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,740
rep and CBD and I like that he had a

1337
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,030
little CBD vape pen that was set up like

1338
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:28,509
an opener and what any of the other

1339
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:30,850
major vape companies just rip it on some

1340
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,590
CBD oil took like two or three good

1341
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:33,819
maybe three or four good rips all right

1342
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,079
like we've been rambling for almost an

1343
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,400
hour I think it's time to wrap up this

1344
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:38,829
show what do you think miss any other

1345
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,320
points on CBD we covered it's basic

1346
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:43,960
medical applications I crossed out all

1347
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,130
the stuff on my list except popular CBD

1348
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,789
strains so that if people wanted to

1349
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh cannabis that was high in CBD just a

1350
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:57,230
few strains I would recommend anything

1351
00:51:52,179 --> 00:52:00,078
Harlequin canna tonic Taurus ooh Tora

1352
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:01,789
Bora ac/dc the Tora Bora is really

1353
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,589
wonderful folks that I've had a lot of

1354
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,970
personally and I know I went over that

1355
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:06,798
list really quickly those were just off

1356
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:08,449
the top of my home the other thing I'd

1357
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:13,009
like to touch and I think before we wrap

1358
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:15,038
this one up is for at least for the pain

1359
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:19,338
and inflammation that I'm dealing with

1360
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:22,730
THC and CBD together in roughly 50/50

1361
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:28,278
mix work two or three hundred times

1362
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:30,798
better than CBD alone or THC alone the

1363
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:33,440
two of them together works it's not one

1364
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:36,139
plus one equals two it's one plus one

1365
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,420
equals seven as far as I'm concerned the

1366
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:40,730
effect is amplified greatly cool last

1367
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,009
man I know it's wonderful when you when

1368
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,619
you mix THC and CBD the medical

1369
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:47,210
applications are wonderful I'm sorry if

1370
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:50,240
I sound a little stoned and I am pretty

1371
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,970
tired but I feel clear-headed I feel

1372
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,439
like alert and present we're gonna

1373
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,719
wasn't true when I got here I was

1374
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,250
hurting so bad I I seriously almost

1375
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,419
didn't come folks and I really liked it

1376
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,980

1377
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,159

1378
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,389
