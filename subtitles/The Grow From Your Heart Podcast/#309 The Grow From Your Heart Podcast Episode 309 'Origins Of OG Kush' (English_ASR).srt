00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,470
music I just wanted to get right to it

5
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,719
it's Thursday I usually try to put out a

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,580
Thursday quickie episode this one may

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,699
not be so fast I've got a lot to talk

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,960
about so let's get right to it you guys

9
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:19,130
I like to start the episode off by

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,469
letting you know what I've been smoking

11
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,599
on today today I've been taking dad's

12
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:26,299
actually just finished off the jar of

13
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,219
Starchild og from our friends at a cut

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,890
above in Colorado Springs I picked this

15
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:34,070
up at the Fillmore location it smells

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,198
kind of like dryer sheets uh I really

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,030
like the way it smells it is delicious

18
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:39,439
it's kind of got a Jack Herer sort of a

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,570
smell if you're familiar with jackets

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,968
also got a trainwreck kind of aroma I

21
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,820
really like it super sativa head buzz

22
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,399
gets me talkative makes my head spin

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,350
great podcast dabs also I've got some

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,030
sour Pez ambrosia

25
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,320
from our friends at apothecary you guys

26
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,390
know I like to get the apothecary

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,909
concentrates when you open it up and

28
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,249
give it a smell it smells like a

29
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:04,250
lemon-lime kind of a candy it smells

30
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:06,829
like a sour Pez then when I smoked it on

31
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,859
the way in the inhalation tasted like a

32
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:12,139
lime Rhine like if you had scraped the

33
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,909
inside of a lime and like that and it

34
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,959
was pleasant but it was really tart and

35
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,180
it was surprising I was like oh [ __ ]

36
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,779
that's a lot of flavor and then on the

37
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,280
way out

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,040
it was just straight-up grapefruit

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,450
citrus I'm smelling the jar again I'm

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,920
picking up more of the grapefruit now

41
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,950
that I'm smelling it again closer to my

42
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,629
face but limes and grapefruit you guys

43
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,649
this one was really unique the sour

44
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:32,769
peasant Broza

45
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,359
from apothecary both of these obviously

46
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:37,009
super sativa because my head is going my

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,468
eyes are wide open and I'm ready to

48
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,180
ramble ready to get into my main topic

49
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:43,699
let's jump right to it I was on

50
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,430
Instagram live and somebody asked me how

51
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,020
do I feel about people breeding with my

52
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,930
seeds of course I do have a seed company

53
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:53,030
I'm Huayra genetics I make seeds those

54
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,740
seeds are commercially available on the

55
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,530
internet which means that people are

56
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,000
getting ahold of them which means people

57
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,310
are growing them which means they're

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,649
finding select males and select females

59
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,859
which may be great candidates for

60
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,679
breeding now who would I be to say do

61
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:12,348
not breed with those great plants I

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,060
invite you to breed with the plants that

63
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:17,509
come from my seeds I will

64
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,520
please do that there are people breeding

65
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:21,500
great projects with things that I've

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,270
made there are things that came from my

67
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,580
Capleton there's a whole seed line that

68
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,469
came from my Capleton there are guys

69
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,819
breeding with my black cherry Kim I'm

70
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,669
sure that there are things I don't even

71
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,958
know about being bred with my stuff I

72
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,268
can't be mad about it

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,340
I did not invent cannabis I did not

74
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,680
invent the seed stock that I started

75
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,110
breeding with I was gifted clones I

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
created a nice clone library for myself

77
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,380
by gathering clones from friends and

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,209
when other dispensaries would have

79
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,129
clones for sale I would go get them and

80
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,750
I got clones through various other means

81
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,780
that I won't mention here on the show I

82
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,340
had a nice clone library and then I got

83
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,629
bored with just growing from clones and

84
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,489
I wanted something different that not

85
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,109
everybody else had so I started getting

86
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,759
seeds and then I started buying seeds

87
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,099
and getting addicted to buying seeds off

88
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,750
of the internet so my breeding stock

89
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:07,818
came from seeds I bought off of the

90
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,530
Internet I kept buying those seeds and

91
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:11,119
I'd find great stuff but then I was like

92
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,860
why do I keep spending money on seeds

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,299
and throwing away mail plants I could

94
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,280
learn how to breed myself so I started

95
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:17,930
studying breeding then I built a

96
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,729
separate little breeding area for myself

97
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,769
and I used one of the male's that came

98
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:24,889
from a seed pack that I bought and I put

99
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:27,200
it put the pollen on clones that I have

100
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,369
gotten from friends and plants that came

101
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,719
from seeds that I'd bought on the

102
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,209
internet so I was breeding two clones

103
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,159
and seeds by using a seed that I had

104
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,620
purchased so I can't be mad at anybody

105
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,939
if they want to use my seeds for

106
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,530
breeding I should be honored if they

107
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,659
find one of my plants that comes from

108
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,729
one of my creations good enough and

109
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:46,129
worthy enough and impressive enough to

110
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:48,199
continue its genetic line I should be

111
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,180
proud of that the only thing I asked for

112
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,969
is credit when you write down what the

113
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,120
genetics are put that you used whatever

114
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,979
of my Cross you use storm shadow [ __ ]

115
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,930
scarlet begonias write it down and if

116
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,189
you're gonna write this down make sure

117
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,500
you write it down properly when you

118
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:06,469
write down genetic crosses ladies first

119
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,930
so if you use a female star dog plant

120
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:11,209
and a male arise you will write star dog

121
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,709
X arise and that's your one plant if

122
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,420
you're gonna cross that plant to

123
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,639
something else you'll put star dog X

124
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:19,430
arise and Pinta parenthesis so it'll be

125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,620
parentheses star dog X arise parentheses

126
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,090
then you'll put an X on either side of

127
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,610
that depending on if that's the boy or

128
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,829
girl if that one's gonna be the girl it

129
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,348
would be parentheses star dog X arise

130
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,180
CAES X then your boy plant whatever

131
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:33,500
that's gonna be so make sure that you go

132
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,870
ladies first when you're writing down

133
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,069
genetics I hope I didn't over make that

134
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,329
too complicated there hope I didn't

135
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,800
overcome placate that for you guys but

136
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:42,199
still ladies first when you're writing

137
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,718
down genetics so it doesn't bother me at

138
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,158
all when people breed with my genetics

139
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,860
because I am breeding with other

140
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:50,990
people's genetics even when I'm breeding

141
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,090
now I have to get other stuff I have to

142
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,530
outsource other things because if I just

143
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:56,269
keep breeding with everything that I've

144
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,218
already got it's just gonna be a bunch

145
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,899
of inbred stuff I've got to pull other

146
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:01,550
male plants out of somewhere I've got to

147
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,589
get other female plants out of somewhere

148
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,759
or I'm just gonna be doing a bunch of

149
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,439
cousin [ __ ] and I'm gonna make a

150
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,650
whole bunch of the same seeds before too

151
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,168
long

152
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,179
so I have to have breeding stock that is

153
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:13,430
not all mine so which means I have to

154
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,139
use other people's stuff and the way

155
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,139
that I honor them and show them respect

156
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,538
is I clearly label what I used in my

157
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,129
crosses so you can see what I'm using

158
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:23,778
and that's how I don't piss off the

159
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,729
other guys and it keeps it fair and I

160
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:27,408
ask you to do the same if you breed with

161
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:29,750
my stuff you've bought the seeds they're

162
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,978
yours like can a car salesman say hey

163
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,658
now when you drive off with this car

164
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:33,918
please don't take it to the east side

165
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:36,319
eat some [ __ ] you and go to the east

166
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,758
side it's my car he's if he says when

167
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,020
you buy this motorcycle please don't

168
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,729
drive it down dirt roads you're gonna

169
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,560
say bro dirt roads with this motorcycle

170
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:43,939
all day don't worry it's mine like

171
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,050
that's how I feel about my seeds if you

172
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,639
buy my seeds and you want to breed with

173
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,408
them have a good time

174
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
those are yours you paid for him just

175
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:51,500
give me some credit if you do breed with

176
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,778
them and when you post pictures tag me

177
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,759
in it that would be cool also alright

178
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:58,009
so that's my rant on how I feel about

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,468
people breeding with my seeds I may have

180
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,740
done that rant on another episode but

181
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:05,718
that leads me into another thing we were

182
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,288
talking on another forum and somebody

183
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:12,408
said that OG Kush stands for ocean grown

184
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:15,228
another person said that OG Kush stands

185
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:17,538
for original gangster I heard a lot of

186
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:19,098
silly things I would like to give my

187
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:23,930
opinion and I would like to start a

188
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:25,610
conversation and hear what you think I'm

189
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,528
gonna go the long route and not tell you

190
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,330
right away what I think o G stands for

191
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:31,490
but that's how all it's gonna be the

192
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:35,109
punchline so a long time ago there was a

193
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,110
website and on this website

194
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,149
this website is gone so you couldn't

195
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,250
find it if you wanted to now it was shut

196
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,388
down a lot of the people were rated a

197
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,129
lot of people that were a part of this

198
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,509
website were rated by the DEA and their

199
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,210
local authorities for growing cannabis

200
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,310
this was huge a lot of people were a

201
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,079
part of this website there are now

202
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,209
prominent members of the cannabis

203
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,859
industry a lot of people that were taken

204
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,089
down would have been dominant members of

205
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,218
the cannabis industry if they weren't

206
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:02,299
rated because of this website many years

207
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:03,978
ago this website was home to a lot of

208
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,560
cannabis growers breeders and

209
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:08,389
enthusiasts and activists a lot of these

210
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,038
people were growing at home and breeding

211
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,840
at home a lot of these people had gotten

212
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,878
seeds from around the world and brought

213
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,739
them back to the United States and we're

214
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,689
growing them in small home grows that

215
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,939
were fully illegal at the time there was

216
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,459
no medical marijuana at this time maybe

217
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,529
California was thinking about it a lot

218
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,269
of these growers were growing and

219
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,079
breeding at home because that was what

220
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:31,609
they had access to was those seeds so

221
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,438
people were here's part of where I think

222
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,218
the og cush name came from

223
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,509
I think somebody acquired seeds from

224
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:39,949
from cush but where's cush I want to say

225
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,538
cush Mountain I want to say cush Valley

226
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,150
but I'm sure that those are dispensaries

227
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:46,459
anyway people got seeds from cush

228
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:48,439
probably from soldiers who traveled

229
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,180
overseas and came back with cannabis

230
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,038
seeds and said these came from cush

231
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,228
either the cush mountains the cush

232
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,120
valley wherever they were the word cush

233
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:58,250
was involved in these seeds they were

234
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,870
delivered to somebody maybe they brought

235
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,310
them back themselves and were on this

236
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,680
website that I'm talking about

237
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,930
I think they grew these seeds I think

238
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,120
they bred with these seeds I think then

239
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,439
they took a handful of these seeds and

240
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,379
what I think what was happening on this

241
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,240
website is a guy like myself that could

242
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,849
breed would breed seeds and send them

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,439
out to five or ten maybe 15 or 20 of his

244
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:20,569
friends I honestly don't know exactly

245
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,240
this is a theory those guys would work

246
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,408
the seeds and then send them back or

247
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,689
pass them around

248
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:29,598
I think that somebody was really

249
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:32,269
narrowing something down and breeding it

250
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,399
with a couple of people and a group in

251
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,679
different locations through the mail

252
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,089
seeds were being passed they'd go to one

253
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,129
guy he would breed do it and do his

254
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,529
thing and then he would send seeds back

255
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:45,439
to the original guy plus more people who

256
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:47,689
would then breed to it and I think that

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,680
out of all of this breeding is where the

258
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,990
og cush came

259
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,120
is from some of this breeding project

260
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,250
they came off of this website and if you

261
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,778
guys haven't caught on by now if you're

262
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,980
og you know what I'm talking about

263
00:08:56,778 --> 00:09:02,120
the website I'm talking about is

264
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:05,240
overgrow comm I personally don't think

265
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,909
that Oh G stands for ocean grown because

266
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,750
a lot of it was not grown near the ocean

267
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,669
and I also don't think that og was

268
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,179
original gangster because a lot of the

269
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:19,639
circles that had the og cush originally

270
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:22,639
were not the gangster types they were

271
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,870
more hippies and they were more more on

272
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,250
the hippie side of life than the

273
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,560
gangster side of life we didn't start

274
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,190
hearing it be associated with Original

275
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,750
Gangster until be real and dr. Dre and

276
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,029
all those guys started talking about the

277
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,958
chronic and the OG Kush so I really

278
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:41,088
think that it came from overgrow dot-com

279
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,099
overgrow the government is a website

280
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,290
dedicated to cannabis dedicated to

281
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,330
cannabis growing dedicated to cannabis

282
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:49,849
rebellious Ness it was the home for weed

283
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,009
and unfortunately it did lead to a bunch

284
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,200
of trouble you guys we are carried away

285
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,789
nowadays with our internet freedom back

286
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,860
in the day people got raided because of

287
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:59,990
this [ __ ] that they did online so keep

288
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,879
that in mind there are people that paid

289
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,278
the price for us to be here and a lot of

290
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,789
them lost everything because of overgrow

291
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,220
calm so that is my theory I think that

292
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,049
OG Kush was some seeds passed around

293
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,910
from overgrow calm and it was a breeding

294
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:16,338
project happening in different locations

295
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:17,689
through the postal service I think that

296
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,570
some of the stuff that came out of there

297
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,490
was OG Kush and that would explain why

298
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,160
there are different phenotypes and

299
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,440
different names of OG Kush the Tahoe og

300
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,629
and the whatever og and the whatever

301
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,420
we'll say the Tahoe and the [ __ ] e we

302
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,039
got Florida and Tahoe California I'm not

303
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,479
sure what part of [ __ ] Florida the

304
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:37,490
creepy is for them I'm sure someone's

305
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,930
yelling into their [ __ ] device right

306
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,028
now saying it's from this part of

307
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,219
Florida but you got the creepy and you

308
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,389
got the Tahoe they're very similar if

309
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,750
you smoke them if you get them near each

310
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,328
other

311
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,639
you got the triangle very similar yet

312
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:51,049
very different they're all similar and

313
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,669
all different they're all og cush is

314
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,229
because they probably all came from the

315
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:56,870
same seed stock and have been kind of

316
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,879
bread somewhere along the line with the

317
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,039
same parent and/or grandparent maybe

318
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,350
they're all different F generations

319
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,969
maybe they're cousins

320
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,710
but I think that that's got something to

321
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,600
do with it it's because of the website

322
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,879
it's because of the mail I don't think

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,610
it's ocean grown because how you gonna

324
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,230
ocean grow if you're not if you're in LA

325
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,360
it's not ocean grown you're too far

326
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,700
you're you're [ __ ] Smaug grown all

327
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,500
right and it's not original gangster

328
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,690
because the people that were doing it

329
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,309
weren't the gangster types I don't think

330
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,100
they would have named it that so my

331
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,139
theory is it came from overgrow the

332
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,720
website I'd like to hear your rebuttal

333

370
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,190
slowly making the videos YouTube has

371
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,679
been cracking down on cannabis channels

372
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,990

382
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,939
the smut it sounds like they're trying

383
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,979
to get rid of weed

384
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,440
in dirtiness and I don't want to fall

385
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,940
victim to it on YouTube so I'm just
