outlandish okay so say you won the

218
00:09:50,559 --> 00:10:01,599
Powerball was right one the Powerball

219
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,129
would you throw it on one hundred and

220
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,440
one thousand dollars on a glass breaks

221
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:11,110
down second would live in my face man

222
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,790
blow everything so if you want a hundred

223
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,169
if you want that billion dollars you

224
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,219
just tie slice up and he'd be in the

225
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,839
basement because

226
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:24,460
oh there's pie and stumbling around

227
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:28,330
stumble in debate let's go there is oh

228
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,670
man just being the high kid now most of

229
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,870
our listeners are right there with you

230
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:34,839
if you're not take a dad right now so

231
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,950
that what joe says makes sense

232
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,950
let's hear a joke

233
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:45,279
so was that mothership event in like for

234
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,860
charity of any kind was it all because

235
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,779
it was all like silent auction style I

236
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,310
think I think the charity was Scott

237
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,039
Debbie's [ __ ] pockets that's what I

238
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:56,079
think that charity was for hi yeah I did

239
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,549
not know under I don't know that there

240
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
was a charity involved only way I could

241
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,879
somehow justify spending a hundred

242
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,009
thousand dollars on a glass piece is if

243
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,289
you could somehow write it off and if it

244
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,939
was involved with a charity that might

245
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,740
be the way that they finagle it that

246
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,740
would be also no unfortunately I think

247
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,870
it was at um it was at one of the trade

248
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,870
shows that happened on the west coast he

249
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,519
was either Vegas or the west coast and

250
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,769
mothership had a huge booth there and

251
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,240
instead of this is what I think what I

252
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,829
was told by somebody instead of selling

253
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,090
mothership rigs they've learned that

254
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,800
they can make a lot more money by

255
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,600
creating demand at these events because

256
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,399
people are hyped so that's how they got

257
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,810
a hundred and one instead of a hundred

258
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,419
is because two people were fighting and

259
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:37,869
one dude set 101 along guy said 100 and

260
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,909
101 got it so I'm pretty sure that's

261
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,470
just he go to the events and I've done

262
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,879
it myself I've bought overpriced [ __ ]

263
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,710
rigs and events cuz it's in front of me

264
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,659
and it's hyped and it sounds like a good

265
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,970
deal and instead of it being 1200 it's

266
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,649
only 9:50 today so I feel like I got a

267
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,700
sweet-ass deal and you buy it then you

268
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,590
get home you're like oh [ __ ] I just

269
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,900
bought this rig done something like that

270
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,490
before but that's how you treat the

271
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,240
height the stood next to me holds up his

272
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,308
new room

273
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,509
this show is sponsored by hitman glass

274
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:06,698
we're talking about mothership right now

275
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,409
but dude this rig is nice this rig comes

276
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:11,469
from illusions class it's the ill glass

277
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,088
flux capacitor it is the right size it's

278
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,439
got a quartz banger on it I like the

279
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:20,319
mouthpiece on it and it's sturdy enough

280
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:21,730
for the email so nice purchase dude they

281
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,618
got him on the [ __ ] hype they marked

282
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,278
it up double what it should be you would

283
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:29,079
have price that's a good rig I like it I

284
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,578
like I'll fix the glasses if you can

285
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:35,828
tell it's not made by some Chinese kid

286
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:37,058
with no protective eyewear ill glass so

287
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:42,599
we can all agree that that rig was a

288
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:46,118
little bit overpriced right over here is

289
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,980
any rig over like say realistically

290
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:51,189
twenty five hundred dollars overpriced

291
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:54,129
like a hundred percent understand that

292
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:57,399
you're paying for the craftsmanship and

293
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:59,259
the dedication that the person has put

294
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,928
into learning and perfecting an art form

295
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,499
and his guess what you really the time

296
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:08,169
if I were he like but I'm just trying to

297
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:12,100
think of a realistic number that isn't

298
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:13,628
affected by market value would value the

299
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,790
markets pudding it kind of depends on

300
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,350
I'm sure everybody in this room makes a

301
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,599
different paycheck and it kind of

302
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,339
depends on oh yeah oh that's too much

303
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
for a rig and different people will be

304
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,709
like yeah I pay that for a rig and it

305
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,058
just kind of depends on where you are

306
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,169
and there have been times in my life

307
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:27,909
where I'd have been like a hundred bucks

308
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:29,498
for a glass pipe [ __ ] you but now there

309
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,419
I'm like sitting there hitting this hit

310
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,528
man short stack that we all know is not

311
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,928
a hundred bucks

312
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:37,178
so just times have change and people

313
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:39,249
change so it's all it's all what is it

314
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:40,990
subjective like what's over profit yeah

315
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,100
spin it over a thousand or two thousand

316
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,048
bucks for a piece of glass you could

317
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,399
drop and break and this rig over here

318
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:47,379
this one is closer to the four or five

319
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,610
and it hits like a boss and it's a hash

320
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,909
pipe still no matter how much you pay

321
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,649
for how pretty it is it's a hash pipe

322
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:57,278
like the only way I could feel like I

323
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,480
would justify a reasonable amount of

324
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,919
money is if you're buying it for a

325
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:07,240
sculpture like aspect of it we just went

326
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:10,808
to the banjo joke it's like more of an

327
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,060
art piece sculptured everything like

328
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:16,000
even that is anywhere near

329
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:18,339
right right but there are so many things

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,740
I could buy a car with I can buy four

331
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:26,320
cars the 500 really nice car buy a house

332
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:28,600
buy a college education you could

333
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,700
realistically own a skyscraper in

334
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:38,980
Detroit with that much you could own

335
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:54,820
[ __ ] Detroit you could buy a few

336
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:57,870
blocks probably all right me too

337
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,180
me as well I'm just saying why are Riggs

338
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,039
$25,000 yeah does there are a few

339
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:04,989
there's one there's like maybe an SD

340
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,730
Rhino Reigate pay good money for and

341
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,129
probably a couple of Coyle pieces that I

342
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,539
paid good money for but then you guys

343
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,100
ever have that feeling like I'm gonna go

344
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:13,449
buy something you get to the store and

345
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,860
grab it you carry it up to the cash

346
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,900
register and the lady tells you how much

347
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,899
it is it's something inside she's like

348
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,230
much money out of my pocket give it to

349
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:31,929
you like I was cool with it till like

350
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:33,550
this moment for 2,500 bucks and the day

351
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,529
before I drove the Denver to go get it I

352
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,879
woke up and I was like take all these

353
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,199
hundred dollar bills and give them to

354
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,230
somebody's right now like it was a cool

355
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,230
idea

356
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,889
needless to say I came to my senses and

357
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,779
did not purchase a twenty five hundred

358
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:57,730
dollar mothership at there's just

359
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,620
something that I can't do that it feels

360
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,970
weird that's a lot of money this is

361
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,259
gonna be the most expensive rig on the

362
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,730
table for a long time and this was

363
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,069
actually sent to me by our friends a hit

364
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,570
man glass so this this will remain the

365
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,870
priciest rate on the table for quite a

366
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,090
while I'm I don't want anybody to think

367
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,659
that I'm hating on these dudes who are

368
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,370
making Bank selling their glass that's

369
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,750
it's great that these guys can support

370
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,009
their families and their kids are going

371
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,570
to college now because the student made

372
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,789
art and it's sold for a lot of money

373
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,800
when you approach it from okay see I was

374
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:28,809
never I was not approaching my argument

375
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,039
from the art standpoint I was

376
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,039
approaching it from the abyss is a

377
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,580
matter how pretty it is so I talked

378
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:46,750
about it on another episode but let's uh

379
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,610
let's look at a picture of it since

380
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,509
we're we're all gonna other people that

381
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,769
listen to that episode might be

382
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,360
listening to this one and didn't hear

383
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,319
that episode so let's go to Instagram

384
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,490
right quick and I want to pull up a

385
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,820
picture and share it with everybody so

386
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,529
we can all see it together crap I search

387
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,300
for a lot of stuff here we're just gonna

388
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:09,759
go hashtag mothership and it'll come up

389
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:11,649
trust me so do you can we agree

390
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,269
Wow I don't see it yet can we all agree

391
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,180
that it looks like something that maybe

392
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:18,069
Tim Burton would have made or maybe if

393
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,810
Wes Claypool had become a glassblower

394
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,889
maybe Les Claypool would have made this

395
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,149
thing there's a picture of it here but

396
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,220
it's not the picture I'm looking for

397
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,800
yeah sure not the Primus all day there

398
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,539
they played yesterday in California and

399
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,879
I heard the show was amazing so let's

400
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:32,980
look at this piece right here it is God

401
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,860
on the top the mouthpiece is supposed to

402
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,870
be a moon then it has got I think that

403
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:39,309
color is called Stardust but it's got

404
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,439
other stuff in it with this like

405
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,329
metallic iridescent glittery [ __ ] that

406
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,500
just drives my eyes crazy I can't even

407
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:50,169
focus on it properly then it is it's a

408
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,480
Faberge egg underneath that but it's

409
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,920
made with such dark glass you can't see

410
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,299
through it to see the proper shape of

411
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,580
the egg and it looks like a hand grenade

412
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:03,159
to me you guys agree with that it's too

413
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:07,389
[ __ ] much it's kind of gaudy

414
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,630
is it's like reflected stained-glass on

415
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:14,490
a lake that's rippling yeah it's nice

416
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:17,530
but I mean it's so ugly at the same time

417
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,029
mothership is known 101 yeah it's an

418
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,710
extra one this to pay taxes on it

419
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:24,099
mothership is known for really like

420
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,779
smooth sleek glass no extra [ __ ] on it

421
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,909
and really nice function yeah clear

422
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,160
function like a clear color maybe like a

423
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,680
the piss yellow lemon drop or the pink

424
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,360
or blue the azure blue is really nice

425
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,820
and this thing is just gaudy and

426
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,849
overdone in my opinion this little moon

427
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:42,309
down here they sent that to the moon to

428
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:45,519
space in a weather balloon yeah he did a

429
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:47,169
whole set of attendees yeah yeah so it's

430
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,450
got these moons around it it's got a

431
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,640
bunch of moons attached to it and that's

432
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,170
supposed to be the actual phases of the

433
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,570
Moon if you'd spin it around it goes

434
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:59,230
through the moon phases it looks like

435
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:14,500
they made a cheap bong and glued a bunch

436
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:16,539
of [ __ ] moons onto it just custom IRA

437
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,759
genetics mothership not coming in the

438
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:23,710
mail they could send me one of the race

439
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,990
car series any day of the week that blue

440
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,180
race car is dope the finish that green

441
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,589
race cars I got cash in my pocket

442
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,779
somebody bought the red one up right

443
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,549
alone of course it's beautiful yeah it's

444
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,069
so gorgeous but that race car series I

445
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,899
will take it anything that's not a for

446
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:40,419
mothership I'm happy the what I want to

447
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,310
say is the reason that cosmic peace gets

448
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,170
away with it is because it is a collab

449
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,329
because it's not a straight-up

450
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,670
mothership peace it's a mothership base

451
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:50,529
and then an artist went to town on with

452
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,470
the [ __ ] to town on it team so that's

453
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,879
why it is what it is and Francona never

454
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,460
gets smoked out of know they were

455

475
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,189
holding it in their hand with a rubber

476

three or four days and people went nuts

482

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,529

504
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,850
assume and everybody's minds went right

505
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,410
- oh my God look at this hash because

506
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:06,599
they saw rubber gloves in a back of it

507
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,070
and that's what you know if you see

508
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,449
lotion and a Kleenex in your buddy's

509

bedroom you think he's drinking off its

510
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,450
if you got [ __ ] back up and in rubber

511
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,230
gloves you're making hash it's kind of

512
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,580
just how it goes

513
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,750
the girl in the room almost spit her

514
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,250
water on me because now

515
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:22,679
the only female in the room almost lost

516
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:23,579
her [ __ ] that was good all right so we

517
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,720
talked about that on the show yesterday

518
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,648
but you guys are more in the loop a

519
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,679
little bit the guys are here yesterday

520
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:30,268
our local dude the owner is hip into the

521
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,320
scene no offensive guys listen you know

522
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:35,819
I'm saying so you guys just moved here

523
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,230
you guys got a brand new house you guys

524
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:40,500
were spoiled because you moved into

525
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,839
sloppy's house yeah that may have

526
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,490
already been equipped for growing if you

527
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,869
had chosen to grow in there

528
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,849
yeah a lot of people that are gonna move

529
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:49,709
here aren't going to have that advantage

530
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:51,990
so there's a few minutes left in the

531
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,240
show that we could keep going for a few

532
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,950
minutes let's talk about things that if

533
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,440
people were going to move to a house in

534
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,788
Colorado and you plan to grow what are

535
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,889
some things you should look at when

536
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:03,898
you're looking for a house before you

537
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,128
move in like have this in mind before I

538
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:06,479
move here look at this when you're

539
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:08,428
looking at houses if you plan to grow

540
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,419
there like the first thing just to get

541
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,159
it rolling like make sure you've got

542
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,710
enough electricity coming into the house

543
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,528
the power is really limited if you get

544
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:19,558
an older house you may have like a 50 or

545
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:22,079
an 80 amp maximum in your house my house

546
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,638
we could pull 200 amps here so we I'm

547
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,839
letting a nice big fancy residential

548
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:26,788
area but some homes you can't pull

549
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,648
enough power to run more than two or

550
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:30,869
three or three or four lights so

551
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:32,849
definitely check out the electricity if

552
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,589
you're gonna have an electrician come uh

553
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,898
here's a good segue into the next thing

554
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:38,158
check out the landlord that's something

555
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:41,778
to really think about you just rolled

556
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,778
your eyes you had a [ __ ] experienced

557
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,439
[ __ ] landlord is that your front

558
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:50,819
door and you've got to grow in the

559
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,200
basement he wants to come in and do

560
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,740
something and there's no keeping him out

561
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,580
make sure you got a good landlord

562
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,120
fortunately my landlord lives in

563
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:02,308
Michigan so they have been here eight

564
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,359
years they drive by when they came to

565
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,678
visit their family and they like the

566
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,619
front yard looks great thank you and

567
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,419
that was pretty much what I got from so

568
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,250
find a landlord if you can find one of

569
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,509
those rental agencies that they rent you

570
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,950
the house and they forget about you as

571
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:15,870
long as you send that check every month

572
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,629
if you can find a place like that those

573
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:21,599
are rare in Colorado because there's

574
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:25,288
because they are aware of what people

575
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:28,079
are renting houses to do very true you

576
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:29,099
really want to find like a local

577
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,798
landlord

578
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,629
if you are planning to grow it's very

579
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,179
easy to grow legally here there's no

580
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:40,010
reason to grow illegally when it's so

581
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:44,970
easy to have all your paperwork in order

582
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:47,429
and then and oh I forgot where I was

583
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,259
going with that all right Wow yeah yeah

584
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:53,400
there's uh other things for your grow

585
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:55,410
room too like what are you doing for

586
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,870

587
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,370
cool with you modifying the house oh

588
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:03,389
yeah you might have to cut some ducting

589
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:05,038
holes yeah you environment is key think

590
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,049
about how many rooms does a house have

591
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,109
yeah are you gonna have enough room to

592
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:23,450
adequately grow don't have crazy

593
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:27,719
expectations not your two closets and a

594
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:39,419
bedroom and a flower flower clones and

595
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:40,980
moms this other room so like Joe said

596
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,809
have a good roommate or have a good

597
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,220
landlord don't get any [ __ ] roommates

598
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,408
you're doing weed that'll pay the other

599
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,058
pills don't get any roommates don't do

600
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:50,159
that that'll screw everything up angry

601
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:51,690
roommates are one of the no offense my

602
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,610
angry girlfriends and angry roommates

603
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,850
are one of the leading causes of garden

604
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:58,259
failure angry partners don't have

605
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,339
another partner do it yourself get your

606
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,829
own house set that [ __ ] up

607
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,959
another thing make sure there is access

608
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:05,699
to water you need to get plenty of water

609
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,220
to your garden

610
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,650
you're gonna need I say probably about

611
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,659
five gallons of water per light every

612
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,980
three days that's every thousand watt

613
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,360
light you'll need about five gallons of

614
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,308
water every three days that's in my

615
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,769
experience if it's too hot you're gonna

616
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:21,750
have to get more water find a place that

617
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,668
you can control the temperature a lot of

618
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,750
basements get really really cold and

619
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:26,009
dank in the winter you're gonna think

620
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,230
this is gonna be awesome but that

621
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:30,329
coldness will give you powdery mildew

622
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,519
that drastic change from hot to cold is

623
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,658
a huge huge cause of powdery mildew the

624
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,980
plants don't know what to do with that

625
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,140
they'll freak out you'll get mauled

626
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,390
you'll [ __ ] up the whole crop also a lot

627
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,790
of the basements around here the

628
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,690
basements are just dirty you would not

629
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:44,279
want to grow in and

630
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,779
basement around here until you kind of

631
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,490
frame it out or build something in there

632
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,799
so look and see how dirty how dusty how

633
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,029
funky the place is check your pipes make

634
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,250
sure you're not gonna have any busting

635
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:54,599
pipes in the basement I know I keep

636
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,000
saying basements but basements are the

637
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,649
best place for aggro in my opinion the

638
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,480
temperature is easier to maintain nobody

639
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,900
goes down there it's a little more easy

640
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,490
to keep private so make sure it's not

641
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,530
real dirty make sure you got somewhere

642
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,180
for the water to go make sure maybe you

643
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,470
got a floor drain or a way to get rid of

644
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,509
the water maybe if you get our old

645
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,039
bathroom shower and old a shower down to

646
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:14,910
the basement or an old toilet down there

647
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,289
make sure you just have somewhere to

648
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,140
dispose of water because there will be

649
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:21,299
water make sure your neighbors aren't

650
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,980
right on top of you my neighbors are a

651
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,419
few feet away if they were any closer I

652
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,549
would be uncomfortable having any

653
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,080
blowers coming out of any windows it

654
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:30,119
wouldn't do it so make sure your

655
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:40,230
neighbors are cool make sure you don't

656
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:41,429
live next any cops or just bust it out

657
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,870
right in front of the cops ass and he'll

658
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,610
never [ __ ] notice cuz it'll be like

659
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,929
why would that [ __ ] grow there they

660
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,129
just carry and grow it here's another

661
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,019
tip when you move in

662
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,330
don't go carrying in your grow lights

663
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,160
and your hydro setup all at one time

664
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:54,929
kind of wait for the if you can drive

665
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,360
yeah yeah if you can drive the car into

666
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:00,630
the garage and unload there do that

667
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:27,059
don't show up with seven sign this as we

668
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:28,230
grow you need electricity you need water

669
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,509
you need somebody get rid of the water

670
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,579
you need cleanliness you need some way

671
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:35,609
to feel secure don't buy a house it's

got old ass doors old ass doorknobs pay

673
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:39,089
attention to your neighborhood it's

674
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,190
easier to get away with to grow in the

675
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:42,750
hood but it's also easier to get your

676
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,250
girl [ __ ] stolen in the hood so

677
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,109
