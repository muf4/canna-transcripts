I'll definitely be back I got a new I

73
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,429
think I talked about the it's a

74
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,018
mothership knockoff basically that I got

75
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,420
there about a week ago and then just

76
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,060
last night I went and picked up a little

77
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,039
hitman it's a mini with the hammer head

78
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,110
on the inside and I had to grab it it's

79
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,060
got a yellow logo I've never seen a

80
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,769
hitman like this with the yellow logo

81
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,900
before and I thought it was super cute

82
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,579
so I picked it up and man it hits like a

83
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,129
Mack truck so I'm super impressed

84
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,750
it really does it's uh your collection

85
00:02:55,128 --> 00:03:00,620
has grown by leaps and bounds and the

86
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,689
new editions were wonderful was the

87
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,730
first word that comes to mind nice nice

88
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,259
I don't have as many rigs as you might

89
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,789
think because well I got rid of a couple

90
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,858
through a place to make room for these

91
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:11,269
so great I swap them out with the old in

92
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,530
with the new that's the truth I'm not as

93
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,959
much of a rig junky as you might think

94
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,370

105
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,969
let's start off the show with an email

106
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:40,280
from a friend this is kind of not

107
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,539
cannabis related and it's funny because

108
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,789
he starts his email this is from my

109
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:45,530
buddy Justin and now the email says so

110
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:46,939
this isn't really a show or growing

111
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,459
question just a matter of personal

112
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:51,560
curiosity what do you think of Matisyahu

113
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,109
do you feel like his music is reggae or

114
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,079
not or not really listen to him just

115
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,329

127
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:22,219
Matisyahu Mike's ridden around in the

128
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,109
car with me and heard what happens when

129
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,820
Matisyahu comes up on the shuffle you

130
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,919
gotta join in and get out those pretty

131
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,909
big it door did you do a choice you got

132
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,319
to get there and get going

133
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,580
with him do that [ __ ] is so much fun

134
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:37,579
I've learned to meditate while you drive

135
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:39,949
not just hold on yeah well kind of wedge

136
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:42,139
yourself in there for impact and then

137
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:44,060
tune out and pretend like it's not

138
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:44,539
reggae all day you put yourself in your

139
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,670
happy place

140
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,770
now your reggae did enough work bro oh

141
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,150
they do play some reggae at work all

142
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:53,409
right so let's talk about how I feel

143
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:56,899
about Matisyahu um dude that's kind of

144
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,490
so one day my buddy Ross Christian who

145
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,169
was one of the guys that taught me a lot

146
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,769
about Rastafari I shot it - Chris much

147
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,590
respect

148
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:05,509
Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one

149
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,709
Matisyahu song on it I came home and

150
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,879
listened to it and I was like that is

151
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,919
the [ __ ] right there

152
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,329
I just really liked the flow like the

153
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,430
music was good but I liked the way it

154
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,990
felt it just flowed really smooth his

155
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,240
lyrics were really smooth over

156
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,740
everything so I downloaded more right

157
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,720
and I loved it I found shake off the

158
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,220
dust of Rhys and I found why VAT stubs

159
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,760
or what was available at that time

160
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,370
so I was driving from Pueblo Colorado to

161
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,740
Lawrence Kansas on a regular basis I had

162
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,939
a band out there and I was lived here

163
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,230
and had a band out there and then I

164
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:36,170
travel back and forth all the time to

165
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,210
take care of life I had a CD player in

166
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,920
the car and all of my CDs got stolen

167
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:44,000
except for the one that was in the CD

168
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,860
player people I know and it was why if

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,509
it stubs it was the wife it stubs album

170
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,129
so that's what I had to drive back and

171
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,168
forth to Lawrence Kansas and it's about

172
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,540
at an 11 hour drive depending on traffic

173
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:55,668
and depending on how things go so that's

174
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:00,290
10 or 11 opportunities to listen to that

175
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:01,699
CD from beginning to end both ways yeah

176
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,740
I totally fell in love with that album

177
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,329
dude shake off the dust rise came a

178
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,879
little bit later in my life I think I

179
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:09,620
got that one right after I got tired of

180
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,939
the Y right after the theft after

181
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,939
everything got stolen

182
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,829

200
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,019
birthday's my girlfriend took me to see

201
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,129

202
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:54,079
City Kansas

203
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,089
I'll vol random places when I lived in

204
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,229
Lawrence so yeah I got to see Montes a

205
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:59,539
few times have seen at the bottleneck

206
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,730
and Lawrence I've seen him a lot but

207
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,500
yeah that artist meant a lot to me just

208
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,480
from that time period it really brings

209
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,600
me back to that whole time period of my

210
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,580
life thank God no water was my favorite

211
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,800
matcha song and then unfortunately when

212
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,709
he came out with the album Youth I feel

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,170
like he put all of his life's work into

214
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,209
the shake off the dust arise album like

215
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,759
all of his writing for 20 years of being

216
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:24,560
a person he put into that and then he

217
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,120
did check out our live at Stubbs which

218
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,920
was basically the same thing just live

219
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,540
and they're like all right now you've

220
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,949
got a production deal in a record deal

221
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,780
it's making an expensive album and he

222
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,909
was like oh [ __ ] I already put it all

223
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,159
out it's like he'd already kind of done

224
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,540
almost like his new stuff I don't I

225
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,850
don't like the new stuff as much as I

226
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,200
did the old stuff but that happens to a

227
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,270
lot of artists I feel the same way about

228
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,870
spearhead kind of the older [ __ ] was

229
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,079
much better

230
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,410
there's something about music that

231
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:53,629
whatever drives you to create it dies

232
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,580
weren't enough money lands on top of it

233
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,139
right that's kind of how I feel about it

234
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,490
like especially if you're like an angry

235
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,918
band that's where you see it the most

236
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,449
you already just got like a 12 million

237
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,549
dollar contract why are you still angry

238
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,259
right and unless they really start

239
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,030
buying just more expensive heroin or

240
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:09,349
something right yeah yeah

241
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,819
where would we board with music this

242
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,530
we've really gotten off the rails this

243
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,649
is odd Cass but what are the music Jim

244
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,569
was a lot about weed he knows so much

245
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,729
more about music I do know a lot about

246
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,860
music yeah I could probably can do a

247
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,689
music podcast I've played the drums for

248
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,360
so long I can read and write music and I

249
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,439
know a lot about music music playing and

250
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,419
listening and then I also know about

251
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,949
bands yeah we could do a whole show

252
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:33,740
about that cuz we've gotten way off

253
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,659
topic but where would we be where would

254
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,279
music be where would musicians be if

255
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,990
they didn't alter their minds a little

256
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,549
bit the Beatles would it never came up

257
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,620
with any of that [ __ ] if they didn't

258
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,079
start life would be very exploring there

259
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,519
my missions done smoke weed yeah for

260
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,259
sure the Grateful Dead would not have

261
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,199
been fun if I was not tripping my face

262
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,870
off

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,379
I think there's a great Lenny Bruce rant

264
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,730
to that effect alright so I want to put

265
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,720
the show back on track just a little bit

266
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,279
we're almost 10 minutes in and we

267
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,110
haven't talked about weed at all hey

268
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,240
Justin thanks for the email dude you

269
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,529
really like made me time-travel in my

270
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,049
mind when I read that it was really

271
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,730
reminiscing on those days matisyahu's

272
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:10,679
great he's got a great message

273
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,509
he's a positive dude he doesn't use any

274
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,019
profanity so it's good for the kids

275
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,730
ah he only talks about good stuff and to

276
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,919
pump your head and heart with good stuff

277
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,870
is always better than listening to some

278
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,759
negative [ __ ] that makes you want to do

279
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,470
stupid [ __ ] I don't listen to things

280

like Insane Clown Posse and [ __ ] like

281
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,840
that it doesn't support anything good

282
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,840
for your mind so listen to some Montes

283

00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:08,879
plants but in the city of Pueblo within

412

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,039
backyard anymore um they did away with

426
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,829
that a year ago statewide you just have

427
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,230
to have it in a locked enclosed space

428
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,850
but every city and county in town now

429
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,870
have their own little rules for the most

430
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,899
part right so here we kissing them and

431

first-degree assault for shooting a

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,750
teenager and destroy them then I would

439
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,819
just cut him down to take him inside

440
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,470

people have commented I woulda shot him

489
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,299
again ah

490
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,769
guys this is cannabis I know this is

491
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,809
your investment I know this is your

492
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,279
business

493
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:11,490
please don't [ __ ] shoot people over

494
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,589
weed you should be growing it legally

495
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,599
anyway it's legal here just follow the

496
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,099
simple rules and if somebody's trying to

497
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,730
steal those plants call the cops that's

498
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,399
what they're there for

499
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,620
that's why legalization is beautiful as

500
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,940
we finally get to use law enforcement

501
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,879
when somebody tries to steal our weed

502
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,170
yeah and we had a friend recently stolen

503
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,810
from who actually called and reported

504
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,298
his plants stolen and the cop asked him

505
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,859
how much was that plant going to harvest

506
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:36,480
was it going to yield and he told him

507
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,859
how much it would yield and he said what

508
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,599
would that cost you to buy at a

509
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,189
dispensary and he told him what that

510
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,230
would cost per ounce he called me and

511
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,419
got a price quote right I thought it'd

512
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,940
be this much per ounce dude and so on

513
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,159
the police report they value each plant

514
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,769
at what an ounce would cost at my shop

515
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,539
yep and now those people that will be

516
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,460
caught because they've got video of them

517
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:58,528
they'll be charged with felony theft

518
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,710
because they took over a certain amount

519
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:03,898
of dollars worth of product it like the

520
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,850
beaut the real beauty of legalization is

521
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:08,368
that we can use courts and lawyers and

522
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:11,069
cops like the violence doesn't have to

523
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:12,238
exist there that's the truth even there

524

ground you gonna call the cops you could

534
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,158
have dealt with it a little bit better

535
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:37,678
Reza dude shot a young kid who was

536

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,450

548
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,238
marijuana plants from a back yard so you

549
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,249
can see this is gonna happen every year

550
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:12,480
if we keep having these illegal outdoor

551
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:14,220
grows just put it inside grow indoors

552
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,778
nobody can see it if you're doing it

553
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,519
properly nobody can smell it nobody

554
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:20,038
knows it's there you can control it you

555
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,288
can grow year round right just go get a

556
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,628
carbon filter and a grow light and a

557
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:26,608
grow book read the book listen to the

558
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:30,118
show listen to the show I know the Sun

559
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:31,618
is free you guys but you got it in the

560
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,298
city of Pueblo it's illegal and if you

561
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,949
grow and it gets something like this

562
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,168
happens it puts a black eye on our

563
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,970
entire industry our entire community on

564
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:41,369
the plant on the movement on everything

565
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,190
somebody got shot over some weed because

566
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:45,139
somebody was growing it outside okay

567
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,450
just

568
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,280
ballpark a decent little gross setup for

569
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,870
six plants is gonna run your what the

570
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,879
best gear three grand

571
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:56,669
oh dude I could set you up ready to grow

572
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,870
for less than a thousand bucks right but

573
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,100
like if you want with the best like

574
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:05,039
three or four Oh 25 how much would you

575
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,269
pay to not just sweat for six months

576
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,159
eight months while your plants are out

577
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,710
back right if someone's gonna steal your

578
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,210
effort that's the truth like for me it's

579
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,480
definitely worth more than a grinder to

580
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,850
and if you think about it this way if

581
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,329
you're growing enough outside to make it

582
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:23,789
worth shooting somebody for it you are

583
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:25,230
doing you're growing more than you need

584
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,750
probably maybe you're growing your

585
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,420
entire year supply I can't judge you but

586
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,160
think about the situation if you need if

587
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,990
you're growing that much you might be

588
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,580
asking for something if you're trying to

589
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,839
get greedy you might be asking her you

590
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,250
might be inviting trouble if you're

591
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,529
trying to get greedy is what I think I'm

592
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,359
saying right this dude's gonna end up

593
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,460
harvesting enough weed to get him till

594
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,279
he's gotta turn himself into gopher to

595
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,500
jail like it sucks they decided to shoot

596
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,119
the kid trying to steal his weed and now

597
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,529
he's gonna end up in jail for it the

598
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,969
kids going to jail for trying to steal

599
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,309
it like it's just shitty all around

600
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,720
because this dude wanted to skirt the

601
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:01,829
law in a place where it's illegal

602
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:05,339
no let's change let's just change the

603

cannabis plants to a car if it goes down

606
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,769
like this everybody's still going to

607
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:20,460
jail yeah but would you have shot at

608
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:22,170
somebody still in your car I have a

609
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,059
feeling this guy would yeah okay you

610
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,590
know we had an incident as in the city a

611
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,169
couple of years ago it got a whole lot

612
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:30,149
of press because it was particularly

613
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,590
brutal this guy kind of lived in the

614
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,620
middle of nowhere and had a trash pile

615
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:35,879
with a bunch of scrap metal in it and

616
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,469
people kept pulling up in the middle of

617
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,840
the night and stealing his scrap metal

618
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,000
so one night he got his rifle and turned

619
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,709
all the lights off and when the pickup

620
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,509
truck showed up people climbed out and

621
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,130
turned flashlights on he opened fire he

622
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,690
killed one of them wounded another one

623
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,880
held one of them at gunpoint all the

624
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,950
cops got there it was looking at like

625
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,360
first-degree murder charges because

626
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,610
that's first-degree murder

627
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:02,109
you can't lie in wait and kill people

628
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:05,859
you flash the [ __ ] out of that like I

629
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:06,939
don't know it's just people oh man well

630
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,490
this is gonna happen all over the

631
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,039
country just happen in Oregon - its

632
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:15,339
Ripper season you guys don't like that's

633
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,678
a big part of growing marijuana it used

634
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:19,990
to be because it was illegal but it was

635
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,790
always also because marijuana is worth a

636
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,039
lot of money especially in places where

637
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:26,889
it isn't legal and if you can steal it

638
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,240
from someone your your cost is zero and

639
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,590
you can take it somewhere where you can

640
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,558
sell it for six eight thousand a pound

641
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:34,329
so people are gonna try to steal it and

642
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,460
the people that are gonna try to steal

643
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:39,579
it are [ __ ] some of these guys are

644
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,079
professionals yep there's a story I was

645
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:45,189
told a story of somebody who got into a

646
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,869
greenhouse with a poly vinyl cover I

647
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,308
don't know exactly what that shit's

648
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,558
called the greenhouse covering thick

649
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:53,079

checks Friday in an effort to audit any

723
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,769
potential underage sales and found there

724
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,509
to be lower underage compliance rate to

725
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,190
be a lower underage compliance rate

726
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,140
sorry I read that wonky we're

727
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,820
disappointed said Lewis Koski director

728
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,050
of Colorado's marijuana Enforcement

729
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,089
Division in a statement

730
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,740
up until now these compliance checks

731
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,839
have been a bright spot for the industry

732
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,670
this recent check drops compliance to

733
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:59,939
92% yeah we were at 99 before [ __ ]

734
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,650
[ __ ] making us look bad the news

735
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,450
comes as a blow to recreational

736
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,790
marijuana in Colorado especially since

737
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,230
the in the roughly 21 minutes months

738
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,450
since recreational marijuana has been

739
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,190
legal stores mostly have been lauded for

740
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,049
their compliance owners and operators

741
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,580
have been praised for their handling of

742
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,309
the hot-button topic of underage

743
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,990
possession and consumption so in

744
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,169
Colorado what they're mainly worried

745
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,319
about is this weed being sold to people

746
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,870
who are not

747
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,279
and also we'd being sold out the back

748
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:31,209
door of the dispensary that isn't being

749
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,220
documented if underage sales and product

750
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,370
and leaving a shop headed out of state

751
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,890
you know in bulk in bulk yes that are

752
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:42,429
the two things that were really really

753
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:44,800
really seeking to avoid here they call

754
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,509
those the fatal flaws yep those are the

755
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,109
things that will trigger federal

756
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:52,930
intervention if they get out of hand yes

757
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:56,079
and I mean just in my world all of the

758
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:57,759
anti pop people love [ __ ] like this like

759
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,730
it doesn't matter that we only dropped

760
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,309
down percentage-wise to inline with

761
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,860
alcohol and tobacco retailers like all

762
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:08,529
three of those businesses sit at about a

763
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:11,469
92 percent compliance rate like 92 92

764
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:14,619
and we're at 92 now thanks to this we

765
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,240
were at 99 thanks to Aspen dip shits dip

766
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:18,939
ship there were two shops in Aspen that

767
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,599
were busted a while ago after they were

768
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,850
busted

769
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,649
pretty much every shop in the state got

770
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,259
a letter saying hey make sure your ID

771
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,780
check system is up to snuff we're doing

772
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:31,359
compliance checks we're not trying to

773
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,940
scam you like they're not gonna pretend

774
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,579
that they're 21 and show a fake ID or

775
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,500
something it'll be an under 21 ID and

776
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:40,389
you'll [ __ ] it up yeah that's how you

777
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,900
get stung and in the state of Colorado

778
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:45,490
our IDs are vertical horizontal yeah if

779
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,470
you're over 21 it fits one way on the

780
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,839
card and if you're under 21 and 50s so

781
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,430
that should be obvious you have to look

782
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,309
at the verticals like I just had a

783
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,680
family member turn 21 and her ID so good

784
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,809
for several months so you've got to read

785
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,340
the date but how it's not hard

786

the store and we turn away 65 year olds

794
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,359

00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,649
don't need an ID and he goes I don't

813
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:49,149
know who you are you can't come in here

814
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,170
and scent the fire inspector away

815
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,120
because he didn't have proper

816
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,910
identification he was in a fire truck

817
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:57,399
but dude didn't have ID so we can't let

818
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,170
him in there that's it period yeah

819
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,940
period that's the rule you don't have ID

820
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,769
you can't come in will okay you could be

821
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,120
Barack [ __ ] Obama and I don't think

822
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:07,329
we let you in there unless you pull out

823
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,369
that ID we had cops come to the shop

824
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,740
because the crazy guy said we stole his

825
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:13,959
wallet one day and the security guard

826
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,849
checked their IDs it was really funny to

827
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,110
watch all of the blood tenders were

828
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,879
standing there like dude he's really

829
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,709
checking their IDs it's the third one in

830
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,180
a row he's getting his wallet out he's

831
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,069
pawning his driver's license and giving

832
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,690
it to our security guard the AUSA's is

833
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:27,309
crazy shout out to whichever security

834
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,350
guard that was yep that's a good job

835
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,179
it's everyone that comes in gets ID'd if

836
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,949
your IDs expired you can't come in not

837
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,710
at all anyone you can't come in yep

838
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,150
every shop in the legal industry needs

839
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,910
to be able to do this it's not

840
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,530
complicated we make vendors wait in the

841
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,300
entry room if they don't have their ID

842
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,099
with them no you cannot go back to the

843
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:47,109
offices you have to wait right here in

844
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:48,759
this chair we'll come and then we make

845
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:49,869
them wait if they have a delivery for us

846
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,240
and they don't have their ID we handle

847
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,469
everybody else first and because all

848
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,759
right let's get back to this article we

849
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,870
were talking a little bit about the spot

850
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,359
we said we weren't gonna we're just

851
00:29:55,869 --> 00:30:00,039
praising the rules that were followed in

852
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,599
Washington state by comparison which

853
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,940
legalized recreational marijuana at the

854
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,679
same time Colorado did but implemented

855
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,779
recreational sales six months later

856
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,390
several stores have been reprimanded for

857
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:12,250
selling to minors Koski said despite a

858
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,320
lack of repeat violations at any one

859
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,299
licensed shop this represents a downward

860
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,089
trend in compliance that is concerning

861
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:21,129
that is very true we've been at it for

862
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:22,359
just over almost two years now holy [ __ ]

863
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,400
time flies there was a lot of

864
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:27,309
information in that last paragraph there

865
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:30,009
re stinging purposefully restating

866
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:31,659
businesses that failed to make sure that

867
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:34,240
they're back in compliance where they

868
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,830
need to be yes another piece of

869
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,609
information you might enjoy dear

870
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:41,409
listeners is if you're at Ibaka or

871
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:44,409
alcohol retailer the fines usually about

872
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,930
ten thousand for screwing up an ID check

873
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,370
if you're a marijuana retailer the first

874
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,110
two penalties you face or a hundred

875
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,268
thousand dollar fine and you can lose

876
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:54,219
your life

877
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:55,419
$100,000 so it's 10 times the fine if

878
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,629
you screw this up as a marijuana

879
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:00,610
business that could close a shop yeah

880
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:02,349
that could absolutely close a smaller

881
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:05,138
dispensary that can shut it down a new

882
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:06,908
dispensary they could be gone yeah ouch

883
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:08,258
I know a lot of shops that that would

884
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,850
have closed down in their first year

885
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:11,679
that would have closed down that Mike

886
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:13,148
and I worked we met each other well I

887
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,950
don't know we we became good friends

888
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:15,819
through that probably would have closed

889
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,528
matter mark that would have destroyed

890
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,700
madam are they wouldn't yeah a hundred

891
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:20,740
thousand dollar fine that woulda just

892
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,569
closed that place down if that weren't

893
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,038
there I would have been hungry all right

894
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:25,269
I'm gonna continue with the article here

895
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:26,888
it says when reached by phone

896
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:28,480
representatives at five of the shop

897
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:30,128
cited either declined to immediately

898
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,870
comment or said they could not discuss

899
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:33,388
the citations because of ongoing

900
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:35,378
criminal investigations

901
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:37,089
obviously we failed in our mission to

902
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:39,490
keep people under 21 out of our shop

903
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:41,619
sent Ryan Fowler owner of the cited

904
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,048
store red eye relief I'm incredibly

905
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:45,699
disappointed I must say I like the name

906
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:47,679
red eye relief that sounds like

907
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,808
something I would have said I Drive by

908
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,879
two of these shops regularly when I'm in

909
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:54,009
Denver I almost stopped at one of them

910
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:55,628
the last time I was up and never just a

911
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:59,440
few days ago should have stopped to let

912
00:31:55,628 --> 00:32:01,240
you in so Fowler said four employees

913
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,308
including a store manager were fired in

914
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,230
the citations wake he added the shop

915
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:06,940
will stop accepting vertical

916
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,798
identification cards and begin using

917
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,679
electronic verification to ensure there

918
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,418
are no underage customers so even if

919
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,620
you're 21 and you have a vertical card

920
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:18,528
they're not gonna let you win

921
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,808
yep which is nonsense yeah you can fully

922
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:22,940
let in people that are 21 and you should

923
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:25,668
they're perfectly legally allowed to

924
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,190
shop in your business um same thing with

925
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:29,840
the electronic card reader if you're you

926
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,370
can't look at the date and see what it

927
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,220
says the electronic card reader I can

928
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:35,599
help you that's true yep it shows your

929
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,819
age actually when you slide that card

930
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,439
reader it shows the actual age yeah but

931
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:42,379
if you can't read a year can you read a

932
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
number at all that's true you guys there

933
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,580
are a few dispensaries if you come to

934
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,778
Colorado and you shop at a dispensary

935
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,460
there are a few that run your card

936
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:51,319
through that little card reader like

937
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,808
they have at the bar that thing does not

938
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,308
save any information you guys it does

939
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,869
not save any information it scans your

940
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,190
ID and it processes the information on

941
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:00,259
your ID and then it shows how old you

942
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,610
are is all it does a lot of people are

943
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:04,038
paranoid that that thing is showing your

944
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:05,449
ID it does not or that it's keeping your

945
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:06,980
information it does not we're not

946
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,750
allowed the dispensaries are not allowed

947
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,179
to track your information the only thing

948
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,429
that we do keep track of is oftentimes

949
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,769
dispensaries will document what state

950
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:18,620
you are from and that is mostly for

951
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:20,538
advertising and just marketing purposes

952
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,769
so we're not keeping your information we

953
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:25,148
don't want to know where you live we

954
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:27,970
don't care we're out of room for records

955
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:31,219
[ __ ] has to be a dick about it but like

956
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,630
we're sort of busy yeah like we don't

957
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,880
have time to even process that

958
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,500
information let alone compile it a need

959
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,390
or anything to do with it either

960
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,440
alright I'm gonna get back into this

961
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,669
article um where was I there we go

962
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,230
we were very concerned about this matter

963
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:47,570
the healing house said in a statement to

964
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,940
the Denver Post we are 100% committed to

965
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,528
compliance in all aspects of the law we

966
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,659
have had no issues in the past and we

967
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,730
were taking this matter very seriously

968
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,440
officials say the citations for selling

969
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,259
marijuana to a person younger than 21

970
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,929
were issued at 7 separate businesses the

971
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:04,158
charge is a class 1 misdemeanor oh so

972
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,620
they could also face criminal charges

973
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,539
huh the person who made the sale faces

974
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,338
has already been cited with a criminal

975
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:13,070
criminal charge and they'll be going to

976
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:14,329
court for it no I know we said we're not

977
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,849
gonna talk about the spot but when you

978
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,469
walk into most dispensaries there's a

979
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,990
security guard up front checking IDs

980
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:24,348
then he sends you back to the budtender

981
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:27,138
who sells you bud Huson then he rings

982
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,820
you up who's responsible therefore that

983
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,480
the security guard or

984
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,500
the budtender me you should be checking

985
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,010
an ID again

986
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,380
I worked we totally asked if we're at

987
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,240
all worried about it we have a lot of

988
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,510
faith in our security guards we don't at

989
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,359
all tolerate the security guard not

990
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,880
doing his job correctly right there most

991
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,099
of those guys are there already goes the

992
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,250
whole company's ex-military and everyone

993
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,199
in that company's event nice so they're

994
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,079
used to doing everything perfect when

995
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,629
they have to it work and so it's simply

996
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,099
done correctly every time we still ask

997
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,720
from time to time we've got a couple of

998
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,569
people that come in the shop that looked

999
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,730
very very young and they're both well

1000
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,830
over 21 but they don't look it

1001
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,780
yeah and so every time there's a new

1002
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,789
budtender there and even sometimes when

1003
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,410
you know there's just a lot of people

1004
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,690
there and we want everybody to be

1005
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:22,429
confident that we're not some under 21

1006
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,960
people will just hey can I see your ID

1010
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,090

1011
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,389

1012
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,730
okay no or your job yep this $40.00 sale

1013
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:40,900
is not worth $100,000 fine and my job

1014
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,949
right yeah and the criminal charge and

1015
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,210
I'm gonna continue with the article and

1016
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:45,409
I just realized that at the bottom of

1017
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,699
the article I didn't see this when I

1018
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:50,239
skim through this the first time all of

1019
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:53,000
the shops are listed I like it so avoid

1020
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:56,750
them yeah or if you're not 21 go there

1021
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,039
I'm just getting to the hall so it says

1022
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,840
those dispensaries need to be held

1023
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,159
accountable said Tyler Henson president

1024
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,200
of the Colorado cannabis Chamber of

1025
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,059
Commerce your job as an owner and

1026
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,849
operator is to ensure your employees are

1027
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:10,190
readily trained that can't happen again

1028
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,809
he added Henson said employers and their

1029
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,800
employees need to understand at what's

1030
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:14,809
at stake here

1031
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,330
officials say the violations can mean a

1032
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:19,610
license suspension a fine per individual

1033
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,460
violation a fine in lieu of suspension

1034
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:25,370
up to $100,000 and license reeve

1035
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:27,110
occasion man that sounds so serious when

1036
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,659
he put it like that I mean think about

1037
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:32,480
it dude what what did the one shop down

1038
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:34,940
here do they got their license pulled on

1039
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,469
site consumption on site wasn't like

1040
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,760
they were giving out dabs in the bedroom

1041
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:39,709
nope

1042
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,770
they had roaches in an employee bathroom

1043
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:47,050
and it was enough for them to

1044
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:48,610
to store licenses underage sales they

1045
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,500
haven't closed the shop that I know of

1046
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,599
yet but I don't think any of the cases

1047
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,719
that have screwed this up have gone

1048
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,130
through that process completely yet time

1049
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:59,679
will tell it's brand-new

1050
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,269
yep my guess is a couple of people are

1051
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,309
gonna lose their license if you get

1052
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,809
stung twice I would bet on it oh yeah

1053
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,519
twice they should yeah yeah

1054
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:08,349
so it says sanctions may also include

1055
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,929
restrictions on the license police said

1056
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:12,489
in a news release investigators say they

1057
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:14,529
will file the cases with the Denver City

1058
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:16,209
Attorney's Office which could issue its

1059
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,880
own discipline raging from license

1060
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,840
suspension to license revocation

1061
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,579
according to the Colorado Department of

1062
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,670
Revenue the marijuana enforcement

1063
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:27,190
division has conducted 172 compliance

1064
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:32,619
checks since January 1st of 2014 and

1065
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:35,710
found 16 total violations so it goes on

1066
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:38,200
to say Denver marijuana shops were cited

1067
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,750
where citations were issued and then

1068
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:43,239
enlists them it says the herbal cure on

1069

reputation that are [ __ ] up I don't

1080
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:12,789
know how a [ __ ] some of these shops

1081
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,940
messed this up red eye relief on South

Cherokee Street you know we can chalk a

1083
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,340
couple of them up to a lazy employee or

1084
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,199
somebody up at the front not giving a

1085
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,990
[ __ ] and you just hand him an ID and

1086
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,789
like they look I've been not old enough

1087
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:30,219
and gotten into clubs just by handing

1088
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:31,869
the bouncer an ID here any was my ID

1089
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:33,579
that said I was not 21 and he's like oh

1090
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,320
you got an ID here just hands it back

1091
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,849
like you said some people aren't [ __ ]

1092
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,190
smart enough to read an ID to figure out

1093
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,750
that nineteen seventy whatever means

1094
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,829
you're this how old you know people

1095
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,690
can't do that math in their head

1096
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:45,608
sometimes so we can give a couple of

1097
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,230
those just to dumb employees some of

1098
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:48,489
it's just brought one of them one or two

1099
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:53,050
is probably just somebody letting

1100
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:55,189
somebody slip through just like I don't

1101
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,230
know what it is but if you

1102
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,000
if the you know if selling to people

1103
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,789
under 21 is part of your business model

1104
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,829
you can go yeah where'd you we're trying

1105
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,960
to set a positive standard here and do

1106
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:08,539
things correctly we're literally front

1107
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,460
and center on the world stage when other

1108
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:15,289
nations bring up marijuana legalization

1109
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,818
as an idea or a concept that they might

1110
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:19,039
want to pursue they discuss what's

1111
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:22,880
happening in Colorado yes we are the mom

1112
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:26,088
every now and then I hear about someone

1113
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,829
from France or London coming through

1114
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:30,289
Pueblo and taking a look at what we're

1115
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:31,730
doing here in Pueblo which this never

1116
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:32,750
would've happened five years ago true

1117
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,639
there's no reason for any of these

1118
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,659
people to be here every trial and be

1119
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,368
interested in what we're doing but

1120
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:41,088
they're coming here to see how marijuana

1121
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:44,750
legalization works in practice and if

1122
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:47,328
they see teenagers waiting in line it's

1123
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,030
not going well it's not gonna spread and

1124
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:51,289
it should that's the truth all right you

1125
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,550
guys we've got one more article that I

1126
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,650
want to get in we've been going for

1127
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,450
close to 40 minutes we get this one in

1128
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,980
here I like it the people seem to like

1129
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:59,059
when I've got somebody else with me

1130
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,818
they'll listen a little longer

1131
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:03,769
so about 36 minutes is the limit when

1132
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,779
there's two of us now listen that's good

1177
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:47,809
you prefer to take so you're looking for

1178
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:50,298
regular dab sighs not this one time my

1179
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:52,069
friend dared me to take well I want to

1180
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:53,750
know yeah yeah like what if you're about

1181
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:55,038
to just pull off the dab for yourself if

1182
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,088
it's your normal day if your dad but I

1183
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,680
want to know what you pull off what's

1184
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:59,690
your average and then tell me how many

1185
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,730
of those you take in a dab session also

1186
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,950
because if you take a half gram and you

1187
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,469
only take one of them then that's cool

1188
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:07,939
if you take five-point ones that's cool

1189
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:10,759
so I just want to know how you do it

1190
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,690

1191
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:15,920
whole bunch of 0.3 like 0.3 is about

1192
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,480
where I like to be and I like to take a

1193
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,690
bunch of like about 6 or 7 of them

1194
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,849
sometimes on a lunch break I'll take 3.3

1195
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,900
ziz what I like for a lunch break I'm

1196
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:27,579
gonna take a cab right now right now I'm

1197
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,579
hitting the hit man let's do this oh

1198
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:36,858
that hits really well you don't remember

1199
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:38,420
how bad I cough no cough little cough so

1200
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:40,429
recently I picked up a mothership and

1201
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,528
knock off it's not really it looks just

1202
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:45,768
like a mothership kline but it was

1203
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:47,719
thinner I think if the glass maybe a

1204
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:49,399
little thinner not that not so much the

1205
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,038
glow yeah maybe a little bit the glass

1206
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,440
way too but the overall size of the rig

1207
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:56,778
the cylinder going up is is thinner in

1208
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,929
diameter okay yeah maybe a little bit

1209
00:42:56,778 --> 00:43:02,028
shrunken of a ship but it was a fifth of

1210
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:02,949
the price of a mothership right it's

1211
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:05,268
like a truck

1212
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:06,649
it's a great rig so shout out to elevate

1213
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:08,689
in Colorado Springs I know I've said

1214
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,099
that once or twice this show but I've

1215
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,650
been buying a lot of glass from them and

1216
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,690
I appreciate the hookups this little hit

1217
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,039
man it's like a goddamn truck I'm trying

1218
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,269
to act like I'm not trying to choke and

1219
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:18,410
trying to act like I've got my breath

1220
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:20,769
together everything but guess what

1221
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:23,440
there's almost no resistance is straight

1222
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:25,480
nails along oh that yeah some choke is

1223
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,889
expect you just get a fat rip every time

1224
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,289
so I feel I can get my brains back

1225
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,730
together sometimes you guys want to take

1226
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:33,259
a big dab it sounds like Charlie Brown's

1227
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,980
the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoon

1228
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,350
[Music]

1229
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,219
is what it sounds like after a big dab

1230
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:41,319
sometimes it takes me a minute to dig

1231
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:43,509
through that hole but I feel like I'm

1232
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,490
back we're a celebrating Oregon having

1233
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,230
recreational sales of cannabis right and

1234
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:50,169

1236
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,670
let's get into this article this is from

1237
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:55,960
Portland Oregon and it says excited

1238
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,610
shoppers looking to score some of the

1239
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,159
first recreational marijuana sold

1240
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,349
legally in Oregon bought up baggies of

1241
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,649
Bud early Thursday taking advantage of

1242
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:07,329
doorbuster prices and other deals

1243
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,760
goddamn that's such a poetic opening

1244
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:14,500
line for a news article whoever wrote

1245
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,390
this is majestic some of the more than

1246
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,130
250 dispensaries that already offer

1247
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:19,719
medical marijuana in the state welcome

1248
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,700
to recreational users soon after

1249
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:23,529
midnight just moments after it became

1250
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:26,559
legal to sell to anyone who is at least

1251
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:32,200
21 it's a really long sentences in this

1252
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:35,139
article right at Shango premium cannabis

1253
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:36,699
in Portland co-founders Shane McKee said

1254
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,409
the first sale came about a minute after

1255
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:40,629
midnight and many others quickly

1256
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,429
followed I think it's not only

1257
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,440
historical for folks in Oregon but

1258
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,909
nationwide anytime people start selling

1259
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,909
that as an alternative to alcohol or

1260
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:51,129
tobacco he said in a telephone interview

1261
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:53,139
Brad Suzman co-owner of canna daddies in

1262
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,910
Portland said more than 90 customers

1263
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:57,429
bought pot in the first two hours at the

1264
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:59,679
store opened at 7:00 a.m. so people are

1265
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,629
out there at midnight buying weed out

1266
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,549
there at 7:00 a.m. by and weed that's

1267
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,680
pretty neat it's like when a new video

1268
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,269
game goes on sale something like that

1269
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:13,750
lines out the door people just buying

1270
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:16,000
weed I'm torn with this story I first

1271
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:19,300
I'm elated that another state is joining

1272
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,579
the legalization ranks I'm glad they

1273
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,370
they're celebrating I'm glad people came

1274
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:26,289
out and that the lines were good a lot

1275
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,389
of medical shops are converting so

1276
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,800
supply might not be the problem it's

1277
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:33,039
been another legal states which is

1278
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,440
awesome but at the same time it's time

1279
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,179
to

1280
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,039
off the shenanigans and step all the way

1281
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,179
up into the legal industry you got to

1282
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,219
put your best foot forward or you're

1283
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:41,419
gonna [ __ ] it up for everyone and there

1284
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:44,118
were a couple of things about the

1285
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:47,269
rollout in Oregon that could [ __ ] it up

1286
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:50,720
for most of Oregon half of the state has

1287
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:52,880
banned shops period the other half of

1288
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,559
the state allows a shitload and if you

1289
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,789
look at a map it's like right down the

1290
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,659
[ __ ] mountain range in the middle of

1291
00:45:55,789 --> 00:46:01,759
the state the coast side approves in

1292
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:02,568
their shops everywhere the other side of

1293
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,369
the mountain range

1294
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:09,619
not a single shop of course and stuff

1295
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:11,450
like opening at midnight when there are

1296
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:13,099
hours that you're allowed to open and

1297
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:15,679
not allowed to be open and they don't

1298
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:18,740
involve 12:01 in the morning

1299
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,358
there's the main reporter covering

1300
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:22,759
marijuana out there that I follow on

1301
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:26,000
Twitter one of her colleagues was handed

1302
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,920
marijuana gummies outside of the shop

1303
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,199
waiting in line doing news reports he

1304
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,210
was just handed free pot candy pot

1305
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,629
edibles specifically candy or [ __ ]

1306
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,750
banned

1307
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:38,000
so we're giveaways

1308
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,519
and it's not like this stuff is that

1309
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,510
it's very shy on day one it's I mean

1310
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:45,800
it's a celebration shenanigans happen

1311
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,599
there was a truck driving up and down

1312
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,680
the street not at all affiliated with

1313
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,180
the dispensary we were waiting in line

1314
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:54,949
plants right it was the funniest [ __ ] a

1315
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:55,969
guy in a truck drove by and threw out

1316
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:59,049
bags of edibles

1317
00:46:55,969 --> 00:47:02,299
he drove buying gave out plants yeah I'm

1318
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,400
90% sure it was somebody advertising for

1319
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,318
another shot that was not at all getting

1320
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,210
business right but it might have just

1321
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,880
been one of us who had blown his stack

1322
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,619
with joy it could have gone either way I

1323
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,970
didn't get up-close and investigates I

1324
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,390
didn't want to lose my awesome spot in

1325
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,909
line

1326
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:21,289
right because by then I was halfway

1327
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:24,230
through a two-hour line but there's some

1328
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:26,659
shenanigans to be expected but it's day

1329
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,460
four seven now or whatever whenever this

1330
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:31,940
is gonna air we've had a week now

1331
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,349
every ID gets checked every rule gets

1332
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,769
followed if you've got a problem with

1333
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:38,750
the rule get a lobbyist and get a lawyer

1334
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:40,489
change the rules to stay level so that

1335
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,358
they work better for everybody you

1336
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:45,709
should already [ __ ] skirt it right

1337
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:49,009
different kind of lawyers

1338
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,530
but yeah it's it's really important now

1339
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,630
that if you're in the legal industry

1340
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,950
that you step all the way up we have to

1341
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,320
put our best foot forward right now

1342
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:59,779
every state you guys every state in

1343
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,030
every upcoming state this applies to you

1344
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,830

1345
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,880
headed all tried to put their best foot

1346
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,119
forward ever

1347
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,910
from 1996 till now it would have [ __ ]

1348
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,440
legal a decade ago [ __ ] but I mean

1349
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:15,559
just like in Colorado we had to deal

1350
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,970
with dr. reefer the boulder city council

1351
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,000
right now is talking about dialing

1352
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:21,889
regulations back down to reality because

1353
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,050
we've gotten rid of and I [ __ ] quote

1354
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:26,239

1355
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,800

1357
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,589
own a dispensary you don't even know

1358
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:32,269

1407
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,279
steady flow he said adding that

I don't know if I read your name right

1418
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,800
Divya Divya Divya Fleming of Portland

1419
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,480
the first buyer in the keys store said

1420
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,430
the atmosphere was upbeat for the launch

1421
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,590
of the new industry it's the end of

1422
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:49,739
prohibition said Fleming who uses the

1423
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:51,000
drug for many medicinal purposes you

1424
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:52,409
guys if I ever mentioned that I was the

1425
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,059
first person to buy recreational

1426
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:56,339
cannabis at the greener side dispensary

1427
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,739
in Pueblo Colorado woohoo I was first

1428
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,570
[ __ ] anyway I'm pretty sure I talked

1429
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:03,209
about that that was like way a long time

1430
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:06,059
ago the store offered its first 25

1431
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,070
customers 35 to 40% discounts and was

1432
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,619
handing out soda coffee juice and other

1433
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,760
refreshments McKee said many stores in

1434
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,400
Oregon were trying to lure customers

1435
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,460
with extended hours food giveaways and

1436
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,650
discounted marijuana shoppers who have

1437
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,630
shoppe errs have one more incentive to

1438
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,150
buy early and often under Oregon law

1439
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:28,110
Papa purchases will be tax-free until

1440
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:29,490
January a savings of up to 20% that's a

1441
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,990
good way to do it get people to come in

1442
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:33,149
and see how it goes and then start

1443
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:34,919
charging tax that's pretty nice the one

1444
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,450
thing I really like about Oregon's law

1445
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,909
is they're really looking to kick the

1446
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:40,679
black market in the balls nice so no

1447
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:44,039
taxes for the first little bit so you

1448
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,719
know it's the old street theory that

1449
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,840
they threw at us in middle school in

1450

can avoid the shortages and price spikes

1464
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,430
that followed the start of legal sales

1465

1485
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,289

1491
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:13,389
with medical marijuana cards as the

1492
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:15,608
state works on retail regulations for

1493
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:17,650
those products Oregon has a robust

1494
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:19,659
supply supply system that has supported

1495
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:21,789
medical marijuana users and the black

1496
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:23,409
market companies have invested in

1497
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:25,750
massive warehouses in Portland to grow

1498
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:28,149
the drug indoors and Southern Oregon has

1499
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:31,179
some of the nation's best conditions for

1500
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:33,160
outdoor cultivation growers don't face

1501
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:35,049
strict regulations yet so the supply can

1502
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:37,328
more easily flow into retail stores than

1503
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,579
it did in Washington and Colorado still

1504
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:41,230
there is concern summer has historically

1505
00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:43,180
been a time of marijuana shortages in

1506
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:45,429
Oregon and most of the outdoor crop that

1507
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:47,230
is ready to heart and most of the other

1508
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:48,940
crop is not ready to harvest sorry I

1509
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,530
skipped were there indoor growers have

1510
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,450
had minimal time to ramp up production

1511
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,519
because lawmakers only approved the

1512
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:56,559
October 1st start date three months ago

1513
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:01,780
and they had time to get one quick crop

1514
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:02,679
in we've got a seasonal drone I said

1515
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,960
Jeremy Pratt

1516
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:07,000
he said we kind of have a seasonal

1517
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,679
growing market here in Oregon said the

1518
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,210
owner of nectar cannabis which has four

1519
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:12,279
stores in Portland we have lots of

1520
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,838
products in the fall and then it kind of

1521
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,089
gets tight this time of year anyway

1522
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,400
green oasis which has two locations in

1523
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:20,559
Portland and more on the way has

1524
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,970
prepared by trying to cultivate strong

1525
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,889
relationships with growers

1526
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:25,750
it will entice customers Thursday

1527
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:27,969

1528

1529
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:32,199
least $40 Kohinoor Matthew Schwimmer

1530
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,970
said we don't know if anyone else is

1531
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:36,429
doing a band and we thought it was a

1532
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:38,919
good idea to give back to the community

1533
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:40,598

1557
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:33,210
just change your world when I think of

1558
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:36,579
what I used to deal with to buy weed

1559
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:39,369
like what was just standard when I was

1560
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:41,940
in high school and in college and then

1561
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,530
in my 20s it was just a nightmare

1562
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,480
especially in retrospect like it was

1563
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:48,400
just life when it was happening it

1564
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,750
wasn't that bad like I didn't mind

1565
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,940
watching how it's made that much but now

1566
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,710
that it's totally legal and I work in a

1567
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,530
pot shop and it's just like picking up a

1568
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:03,309
cheeseburger on the way home it's so

1569
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:05,920
much better yeah if I was afraid of it

1570
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:07,989
at first big it's so much better I can't

1571
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,180
adequately put it into words well I came

1572
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:14,139
from the black market and I was afraid

1573
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:16,509
of all of this and it's I don't know

1574
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:20,019
freaky to a lot of people it's a huge

1575
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:22,569
change if you live in a non legal state

1576
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:23,949
you worry about what do you I don't know

1577
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:26,050
how much weed you buy but when half of

1578
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:27,489
it is gone you start thinking about [ __ ]

1579
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,099
where am I gonna get more wheat cuz

1580
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,659
there's no reliable spot I never have to

1581
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:33,340
think where am I gonna get my next bag

1582
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:36,429
of weed because

1583
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:38,980
if I don't if I don't grow it I can go

1584
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:41,349
to the shop in which I work or I can

1585
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,849
drive to one of my other buddy shops or

1586
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:44,769
I can drive to one of my other friend

1587
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,839
shops or I'm also a medical marijuana

1588
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:48,880
patient so I could drive to a medical

1589
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,590
dispensary excuse me I'm trying to burp

1590
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,410
I can drive to a medical marijuana to

1591
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:55,000
shop and get whatever cannabis I need in

1592
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,159
there so it is a little bit better that

1593
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,789
way it made our more available way more

1594
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:00,159
available

1595
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,659
it made weed more advanced the

1596
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,849
innovations that have come with this

1597
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:08,049
legalization have been incredible

1598
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:10,630
so I like it I think it's way better but

1599
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,610
I fear this so much better legalization

1600
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:16,390
it's beautiful we can do so many things

1601
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:19,539
like it's not so like I never had

1602
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:21,250
trouble finding pot before in my life it

1603
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:24,009
never came up

1604
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:26,980
I might have trouble locating good pot

1605
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:28,630
or the same pot Wow and it was always

1606
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,969
horseshit whatever you bought like it

1607
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:33,220
was never what they said it was right

1608
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:34,779
you'd ask do you have any of this and

1609
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:36,009
they go oh yeah and they'd go get a

1610
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,440
handful of something different if you

1611
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,750
like this is the name you said yep um

1612
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,240
and you just believed it that was the

1613
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,079
best you had hopefully you weren't

1614
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:50,469
getting cheated and that was just life

1615
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:53,019
now weed there's ten stores within a

1616
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:54,669
15-minute drive from both our homes yeah

1617
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:57,039
and that's pretty much true across

1618
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,480
Colorado with this yeah and you can go

1619
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,730
to two or three of them and see what you

1620
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,380
do and don't like if every shops got

1621
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,050
different pricing every shops got a

1622
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:07,119
different selection there are major

1623
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:10,269
companies across Colorado where you can

1624
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,769
kind of find their stuff everywhere sort

1625
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:13,570
of like Coke and Pepsi like you don't

1626
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:14,440
have to go cheap with you store yet she

1627
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,600
would choose cheap you choose

1628
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,880
Incredibles there in almost every shop

1629
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,429
that appear like there's a handful of

1630
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,590
major edible companies that are

1631
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:25,809
everywhere now I feel bad for the

1632
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,059
delivery people that's a lot of

1633
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:30,059
paperwork

1634
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:33,519
Dixie like there's a bunch of them and

1635
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:36,070
it's just beautiful you walk in and

1636
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,900
there's 3040 I mean sometimes only five

1637
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:40,059
or six but there's a selection of buds

1638
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,400
you get a look at them smell them you

1639
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,750
get to know the price like it's not

1640
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,369
weird that you drove someone's house and

1641
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,000
spent 20 minutes in the living room and

1642
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:48,799
you don't want to buy this you can just

1643
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,150
thanks and leave ya if you know why if

1644
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,560
you go to the dispensary you don't like

1645
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:53,269
what's in there you can leave you don't

1646
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,009
have to buy anything there yeah and

1647
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:57,259
people ask me what the minimum purchases

1648
00:58:55,010 --> 00:59:00,020
it's like nothing if you don't want any

1649
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,670
of this please you don't have to buy

1650
00:59:00,019 --> 00:59:03,079
like I'll show you around everything and

1651
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:05,269
you can leave knowing what's going on

1652
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,489
but dick and then go look at a few other

1653
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:08,750
places you can find nothing yeah like

1654
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:10,399
half the time when you do that I give

1655
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,619
you a coupon book with everybody in the

1656
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,789
town listed there you go I just need

1657
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:15,440
something to do for the day so guys

1658
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,579
don't feel obligated to buy something if

1659
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,829
you're in a dispensary and you don't

1660
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:20,150
like what you see don't ever bet your

1661
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:21,650
money you work for that you're not

1662
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,869
wasting their time that's a store you

1663
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:25,519
can go there and do what you need to do

1664
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:28,099
if you're a marijuana fan you're gonna

1665
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,570
like what you see yeah it almost any

1666
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:33,049
shop you go to especially if it's the

1667
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:35,240
first shop you go to I went I was in

1668
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,800
Colorado Springs hiking one day and I

1669
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,239
had a friend with me I had hash with me

1670
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,670
I just travel with dads I don't really

1671
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,169
take flowers with me we called them you

1672
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,389
guys that aren't Colorado connoisseurs

1673
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,610
we called the buds we just call it

1674
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:48,139
flowers no I didn't have any flowers

1675
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:51,079
with me and somebody wanted to smoke

1676
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:52,609
some weed and so we're driving and I was

1677
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:54,860
like a look at dispensary and we pull up

1678
00:59:52,610 --> 01:00:03,920
dude I would not smoke anything in that

1679
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:06,050
[ __ ] place it all smells exactly the

1680
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,180
same there's no difference on any of

1681
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,740
these strains like it was yeah I just

1682
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:14,089
left I didn't need anything out of there

1683
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:16,539
I've left many a mini shop yes some of

1684
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:19,220
them aren't up to par some of them only

1685
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:22,039
still exist because enough of the

1686
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:25,009
population legitimately had to stop

1687
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:27,529
smoking weed 30 years ago because it was

1688
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:29,210
too risky for him and only now that

1689
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,790
they're retiring and that their kids are

1690
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:33,650
grown are they getting out and trying to

1691
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:34,699
buy weed again I mean for 30 years they

1692
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,500
didn't know who to call

1693
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:38,839
yeah and we're too worried about asking

1694
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,730
their friends and neighbors about losing

1695
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,039
their jobs or custody of their kids or

1696
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,780
whatever yeah you know they just didn't

1697
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,300
and now they can just pull up to a ship

1698
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,870
walking and ask for an eighth I don't

1699
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,730
know those people

1700
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:52,009
I talk to every day have super silver

1701
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:54,170
hair and huge smiles it's fun I've been

1702
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,550
working outside of the shop lately at my

1703
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:57,170
job that I've been doing - just required

1704
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,190
some cleaning of some [ __ ] that's taken

1705
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,470
about a week and I've been out in the

1706
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,659
back

1707
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:02,250
with the door open and I see a lot of

1708
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,170
people walk by because there's a parking

1709
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,449
area of there and they walk by me most

1710
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,909
of the people that I see are older folks

1711
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:10,889
it's not a lot of young punks buying

1712
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:12,929
weed it's older folks that used to smoke

1713
01:01:10,889 --> 01:01:15,809
back in the day like you're saying that

1714
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:18,179
have kids that are in college now like

1715
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:20,608
yeah you see him come in you see a

1716
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:22,618
20-something college kid come in with

1717
01:01:20,608 --> 01:01:24,119
his mom or his dad and they go buy weed

1718
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,050
together and I think it's really funny

1719
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,960
to see that [ __ ]

1720
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,000
most of the 21 22 year-old people I see

1721
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:34,139
you're on family vacation that's awesome

1722
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,358
yeah it's a lot of fun we get a lot of

1723
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:40,348
younger people too but definitely the

1724
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:41,460
tourist economy is is retirees if you

1725
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:43,349
think about it it makes sense if you're

1726
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,588
22 there's no reason to fly to Colorado

1727
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:48,300
to buy weed except for the enjoyment of

1728
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:49,619
buying legal cannabis and getting to see

1729
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,230
what the selection and the hypes all

1730
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:55,140
about because you know 30 people this

1731
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:57,300
we're happy to sell you a bag of weed or

1732
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:59,190
at least one or two yeah there's no

1733
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,568
reason to come here and spend the money

1734
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:03,599
on the flight for what you can do at

1735
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:05,309
home already but if you're 65 there's

1736
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,859
still a lot of risk in Oklahoma

1737
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:10,409
[ __ ] yeah there's none here and it just

1738
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:12,779
blows people away I heard that at least

1739
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:15,029
twice three times a week know where I'm

1740
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,619
from this is that this is really frowned

1741
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,510
upon we would get in so much trouble for

1742
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,769
this everyone would think bad about us

1743
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:22,410
if they knew that we were here doing

1744

01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,579
unless it's me cuz I can't a queen I

1768
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,380
can't actually if they have dreadlocks

1769
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:14,360
that last statement doesn't apply right

1770
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,890
so yeah if you're walking through the

1771
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,090
airport you got extra weed on you and

1772
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:19,069
you see somebody with dreadlocks they

1773
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:21,170
just flew in they need some weed just

1774
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:23,090
hand him your bag maybe I should

1775
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,760
rephrase that like okay so the guy that

1776
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:27,500
works at McDonald's really wants your

1777
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,260
unfinished bag of weed he could really

1778
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,630
use that kind of charity and sort of pat

1779
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:34,340
on the back but if you give it to him at

1780
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,289
the drive-thru window he's gonna get

1781
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:39,590
fired you were trying to do something

1782
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:44,360

1783
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:46,940

1784
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,130
