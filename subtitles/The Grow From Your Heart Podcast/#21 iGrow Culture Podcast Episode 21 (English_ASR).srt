107
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,120
rosta Jeff it's a really good question

108
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,799
the answer is a total of soil is 54

109
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,360
cubic feet which is about 350 Gall uh

110
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,840
it's all in one bag also so instead of

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,239
buying a whole bunch of separate bags

112
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,079

113
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,039

115
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,759

116
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,519
pots if you run s gallon pots like I

117

a little uh little half a second of

188
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,279
Silence because it's a podcast a moment

189
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,719
of silence would be ridiculous so here's

190
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,399
a half a second of silence for King

191
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Cassi the

192
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,439

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,720
moving much respect um I am sad to

194
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,120
inform you I'm gonna turn the music way

195
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,879
down for this one also I'm sad to inform

196
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,598
you we had an event scheduled for July

197
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,039
27th at the Brickyard I've been talking

198
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,120
about it quite a bit we're trying to get

199
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,439
that uh hookah bar turned into a dab bar

200
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,598
unfortunately it's not going to happen

201
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,800
the event is cancelled and that place is

202
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,279
not going to get to be turned into a

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
smoking establishment I apologize for

204
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,478
advertising an event that didn't happen

205
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,280
uh the city is against us every step of

206
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,800
the way they do not want us to get this

207
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,119
place open they do not want us to have

208
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
our event I planned on taking live

209
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
plants to the event so that we could do

210
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,439
a little bit of education and I could

211
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,478
show a male plant a female plant I had

212
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,918
plants in different stages of flower for

213
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,519
this

214
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,399
event but uh we can't take plants that

215
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,799
they they uh said they would confiscate

216
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,758
the plants we can't risk taking plants

217
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,319
and getting them taken uh I just can't

218
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
do that to myself that's medicine for my

219
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,598
patients I'm a caregiver and they're

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,039
going to need that medicine so I can't

221
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,959
do that so unfortunately the event that

222
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,399
I had planned that I had talked about

223
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,959
for July 27th at the Brickyard is

224
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,679
cancelled uh we couldn't come to an

225
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,239
agreement with the city they do not want

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,598
us to do the event uh I don't want

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,759
anybody to get in trouble I don't want

228
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,279
my plans to get taken so we have uh we

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
have backed out of the event and I do

230
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,918
apologize for

231
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,879
that uh the other day I said something

232
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,279
on the show I don't remember if I said

233
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,240
it on the show or just in uh

234
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
conversation with people but I need to

235
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,598
correct something that I said I'm going

236
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,598
to go to a website here this is actually

237
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,120
uh from Ed rosenthals I've just got it

238
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,639
on my computer it's easier to do while

239
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,959
we're doing a show Ed r THS marijuana

240
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,479
growers handbook I'm trying to show it

241
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,759
to the camera I'm not watching the video

242
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,680
I should put the video up on the screen

243
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:40,399
so I can see the video feed uh here we

244
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,598
go this is the book that uh I'm coming

245
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,039
from so I said something about Red

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,920
Spectrum right and I may have gotten it

247
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,439
backwards for what I told you guys so

248
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,879
this is from the book I just showed you

249
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,040
all credit for what I'm saying right now

250
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,879
goes to Ed Rosenthal Ed don't get mad at

251
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,159
me for saying this on the show uh you'd

252
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,360
want people to know this it's called the

253
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,600
critical light period and let me give

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
you a quick explanation of what the

255
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,159
critical light period is is in uh my

256
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,720
opinion and like a little quick cuz you

257
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,319
need to know that to get to where we are

258
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,240
the critical light period is the amount

259
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,360
of dark time that uh specific cannabis

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
strain will take to flour so let me

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,519
elaborate with Ed's article here got to

262
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,839
take a big breath because I've been

263
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,519
taking

264
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,120
dabs all

265
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,799
right this 12to formula has been

266
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,360
accepted without question by Growers all

267
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,639
over the world

268
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
probably probably one of the reasons for

269
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,319
this was my discussion of the technique

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,759
in some of my early books the 1212

271
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,720
regimen was selected because my

272
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,360
co-author and I reasoned that no matter

273
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,399
what critical period of variety might

274
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,159
have given 12 hours of Darkness it would

275
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,720
flower however most marijuana varieties

276
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,719
need fewer than 12 hours of Darkness to

277
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,278
flower now what I was talking about with

278
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,480
somebody was they were saying that their

279
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,000
plants are starting to flower and it's

280
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,720
not 12 hours of Darkness outside uh yes

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,078
that's because of the sunset and the

282
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,800
sunrise have specific color spectrums

283
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,159
that triggering hormones in your plants

284
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,359
is what I was telling them and I was

285
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,879
calling all of this info from memory so

286
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,879
I think I got it backwards to tell you

287
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,200
the truth so uh if I said that on a

288
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,919
podcast or if I said that to you in

289
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,920
person I need to correct that here's

290
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,199
what Ed Rosenthal has written a little

291
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,559
bit more about it uh if marijuana plants

292
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,879
grown Outdoors required a 12-hour dark

293
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,479
period to flower they would not be

294
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,200
induced to start flowering until

295
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,159
September 21st the first day of autumn

296
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
when day and night are equal length they

297
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,559
would ripen 6 to 8 weeks later and in

298
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
real life most modern varieties ripen

299
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,399
between early September and late October

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,759
budding was triggered 68 weeks earlier

301
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,759
for instance an 8-week variety that

302
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,879
requires 55 days from forcing to

303
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,480
maturity which would normally ripen

304
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,439
October 1st would start flowering August

305
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,120
1st at that day in San Francisco Sunrise

306
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,240
occurs at 5:14 and sunset at 9:18 which

307
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,759
is 7:18 a total of 14 hours and 4

308
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,159
minutes Dawn and dusk add another 15

309
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,200
minutes of red light plants use the

310
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,958
absence of this spectrum to measure the

311
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,519
dark period the total lit period came to

312
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,958
about 14 hours and 20 minutes leaving 9

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,000
hours and 40 minutes of Darkness the

314
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,399
critical period for this plant was 9

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,200
hours and 40 minutes if it were given

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
just 10 hours of dark period daily

317
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,278
indoors rather than 12 it would still

318
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,680
flower gardeners growing indoors who

319
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,200
discover the critical time need to

320
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,000
induce flowering uh the critical time

321
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
needed to induce flowering can use this

322
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,720
information to get more efficient use of

323
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
their indoor Garden currently plants

324
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,680
grown under a 122 cycle spend half their

325
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,480
time in the dark if these plants have a

326
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,078
critical flowering time of for instance

327
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,480
10 hours of Darkness daily they can Prov

328
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,359
be provided 14 rather than 12 hours of

329
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,120
light each day so that they can receive

330
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,759
almost 177% more energy which they use

331
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,360
to produce sugars used for more and

332
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,360
faster

333
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,200
growth so does that make any sense you

334
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:02,879
guys it's the it's a

335
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,759
it's called the critical period for the

336
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,799
specific strain most of your uh your

337
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,799
like cush strains your indicia stuff

338
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,199
that's going to have a critical period

339
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,799
apparently closer to uh that's going to

340
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
have like your 12-hour stuff your more

341
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,399
equatorial stuff you may be able to cut

342
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,039
that down just a little bit actually I

343
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:26,198
heard DJ Short say that he runs most of

344
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:27,759
his plants on a uh it's 13 off 11 on and

345
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,958
he said that that shows a little bit

346
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,958
more phenotypical expression is what

347
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,679
that does uh which means that if you're

348
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,759
growing from seed and you're trying to

349
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,958
find that keeper you'll get to see

350
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,078
larger variances in your seed stock if

351
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,879
you've got a little F1 hybrid there I

352
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,838
had another article I got to click back

353
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,720
a couple of steps

354
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,519
here um maybe I've lost it huh I learned

355
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,360
a whole lot of stuff about M here it is

356
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,519
sorry I hate to stumble do that but

357
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,759
looking for stuff on the internet while

358
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
I'm talking this guy broke something

359
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,600
down there are things

360
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,159
uh cannabis plants where's this coming

361
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
from Let me give credit this is from

362
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,198
marijuana growers hq.com light cycles

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,399
and flowering

364
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:13,679
cannabis uh says cannabis plants are

365
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,480
referred to as long night or short day

366
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,838
plants because they require a long

367
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,879
period of Darkness to trigger the

368
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,000
hormone that tell the plant to switch

369
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,519
from vegetative growth to flowering

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,078
these light receptors are color pigments

371
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,399
in the leaves called phytochrome red and

372
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,879
phytochrome far red and they're going to

373
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,440
start abbreviating that so I need to try

374
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,078
to remember which is which these

375
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,880
pigments get their names from the types

376
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:39,479
of light they absorb phytochrome red

377
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,000
absorbs red light between 600 and 760 it

378
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,199
doesn't give me a definition of what

379
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,559
those are and uh phytochrome far red

380
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:51,399
absorbs far light between 760 and 800 NM

381
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,599
uh I don't remember what NM is and

382
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,919
that's I should sorry I went blank on

383
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,680
that one just now when they wrote it on

384
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,000
the screen uh these two pigments

385
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,719
chemically react to the light and

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,278
Trigger the plant to flower or not uh

387
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
this is where it gets a little confusing

388
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,039
and cannabis plants the normal presence

389
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,439
of phytochrome far red switches off the

390
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,078
flowering signal the level of

391
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
phytochrome far red is what you can

392
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:16,000
manipulate to adjust the photo period

393
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,039
phytochrome far red is quickly produced

394
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,440
when plants are exposed to light that

395
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,679
contains far red

396
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,560
wavelengths when there is light the

397
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,799
phytochrome far red and phytochrome red

398
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,799
maintain a balance when the Sun goes

399
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,879
down or the lights go out the darkness

400
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,838
gradually switches the phytochrome far

401
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,720
red to phytochrome Red because of this

402
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,160
the phytochrome red levels gradually

403
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,480
increase and the far red gradually

404
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,919
decreases during the dark period the

405
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,360
presence of red is neutral is a neutral

406
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,319
condition to the plants and essentially

407
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,360
tells them nothing when the light

408
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,759
returns or if a small amount of far red

409
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,600
light interrupts a dark period the red

410
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,600
immediately switches back to far red if

411
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,040
the plant is without light long enough

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,720
the far red will decrease past a Tipping

413
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,879
Point this decreased level of

414
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
phytochrome far red signals the plants

415
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,278
that fall is approaching and the plants

416
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,759
begin

417
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,120
flowering in short the presence of

418
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,000
phytochrome far red due to long hours of

419
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,480
light and short hours of Darkness keep

420
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,320
the plants in the vegetative phase if

421
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,199
the plant experiences enough hours of

422
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,440
Darkness most of the phytochrome far red

423
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,559
turns to phytochrome red and the low

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,600
level of far red signals the plant

425
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,078
hormones to begin flowering that's a

426
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,800
really technical version of what I tried

427
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,159
to say the last time I gave this uh

428
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,599
little rant and I think I got it

429
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,639
completely backwards to tell you the

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
honest truth so that goes to show you

431
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,919
right there that sometimes you got to do

432
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
your research you got to remind yourself

433
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,759
even if you think you know what you're

434
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,278
doing you might [ __ ] up and say

435
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,560
something wrong on a podcast and try to

436
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,000
embarrass yourself but you know what I

437
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,159
don't feel embarrassed I'm glad that I

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,759
got to learn with you guys we're going

439
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,399
to go find out what that one little

440
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,720
abbreviation that they wrote there I've

441
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,078
never seen it written like that before

442
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,399
I'm going to find out what that means so

443
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,919
I can share that with you where was

444
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,679
it right there going to Google that and

445
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,679
find out what that

446
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,720
means Googling it right now

447
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,399
NM

448
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,639
light measurement definition pops up as

449
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,198
soon as I start typing that visible

450
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,039
light is usually defined as having a

451
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,399
wavelength okay so that's that is

452
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,159
nanometers what I thought it was they

453
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,159
just wrote it uh small n capital M and I

454
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,519
haven't seen it like that so that's

455
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,120
nanometers as well what I thought it was

456
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,560
there in that that article all right

457
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,240
doing pretty good on that one until

458
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,359
Safari just decided to freeze up there

459
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,519
we go cool all right so uh man this is

460
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,839
going to be a short episode I really

461
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,120
just wanted to come on and uh talk about

462
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,480
having to uh cancel the committee for

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
the responsible regulation of cannabis

464
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,879
uh party that we were going to have at

465
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,959
the Brickyard I want to say that once

466
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,360
again in case you guys are skimming

467
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,638
through this episode the party the

468
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,278
seminar the educational seminar we

469
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,600
planned to host it has been canceled uh

470
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:02,958
I was going to take some live plants and

471
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,199
show you guys those we had people that

472
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,798
were going to talk about all kinds of

473
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,720
cool stuff we had a miniature job fair

474
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,240
planned

475
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,000
out the uh city of pelo does not want

476
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,679
that to happen so I apologize it's

477
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,199
beyond our control the police department

478
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,038
have threatened us and scared us and we

479
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,079
don't want police interaction so uh

480
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:19,599
we're going to back out we're going to

481
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,279
bow down and just uh not do that sorry

482
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,279
it's the best we can do right now for

483
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,838
what we've

484
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,720
got uh all right enough begging for uh

485
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,558
your forgiveness I do apologize if you

486
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,960
were planning to come out uh message me

487
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,359
and we'll find something else to do

488
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
how's that so if you're listening on

489
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,879
