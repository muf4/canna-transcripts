friends all right let's jump right into

43
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,719
this episode i want to talk about

44
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,319
storing our seeds in a few previous

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,719
episodes i've taught you how to make

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,879
silver thiosulfate solution i taught you

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,798
when to pollinate how to pollinate how

48
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,640
to pollinate uh how to apply the pollen

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
how to store the pollen we've gotten all

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
the way up to making seeds we have

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,478
harvested seeds now let's talk about

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,118
what do we do with those seeds the first

53
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,639
answer is going to be grow them as a

54
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,038
seed breeder my favorite thing to do

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,719
with new seeds is to grow them as a seed

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,039
breeder who made new seeds and sent them

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,719
out to my friends i want you to grow

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,598
them the worst thing for a seed breeder

59
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,759
to see is seeds in a box in a vault in a

60
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,878
drawer not getting grown not getting any

61
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,199
attention we want those in the dirt on

62
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,280
the websites on the packages it says

63
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,159
that it may be illegal to germinate them

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,159
in your area it may be a souvenir but

65
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
deep down inside we really wish that you

66
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,199
would grow the [ __ ] out of those and

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
send us a bunch of pictures that's what

68
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,479
we want so

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,479
after you've made seeds the next thing

70
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,238
to do is to grow them of course

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,079
sometimes you can't do that i make more

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
seeds than i could possibly grow in my

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,760
lifetime i've got an army of testers a

74
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,318
gang of friends out there just growing

75
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,840
seeds for me so the most uh the best

76
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,199
thing to do is to grow them i understand

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
you can't grow all them you've got to

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,199
store some of them let's talk about

79
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,158
storing our seeds let's back up to the

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,839
point of uh just before getting the

81
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,079
seeds into packages we'll talk a little

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,080
bit about harvesting them before we can

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
even think about uh

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
storing these seeds in any way they need

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,800
to be completely dry i've said the words

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
dry so the dry dry dry i've said those

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
words so many times while talking about

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
storing pollen while talking about

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
harvesting while talking about storing

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
seeds dryness is very important when it

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
comes to storage we don't want our weeds

92
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,239
super dry we don't want our buds dry

93
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,238
that's why we do a slow drying cure but

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
for seeds for pollen we need that stuff

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
super dry moisture is your worst

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
nightmare for seeds and pollen so keep

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,158
that in mind throughout this entire

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
process that moisture is your worst

99
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,399
nightmare also seeds don't like drastic

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
temperature changes we will talk about

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
that more but let's talk about getting

102
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,639
the seeds from the buds just in case you

103
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,798
missed the harvest episode let's get the

104
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,479
seeds from the buds we want the buds

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
super dry

106
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,719
a lot of people have this idea that

107
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
seeds need to be wintered or frozen or

108
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
cold over a season or something like

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
that that is not accurate i talked about

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,318
in a previous episode that i've seen

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
seeds germinate inside the plant which

112
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,759
tells me they don't need any time to

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
wait once they're ready once they're

114
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,438
ripe they are viable they're powerful

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
seeds they're potent they're vigorous

116
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,079
they're ready to go so moisture can

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
cause that to happen inside of the wet

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
buds

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,439
if we were to store wet seeds or wet

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
buds or wet pollen into a container and

121
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,959
seal it up and just ignore it it will

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
definitely create a moldy environment

123
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
which will ruin your product so let's

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,399
get this product super dry i like to get

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
the seeds dry i like to get the product

126
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,439
to bone dry before i start packaging it

127
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,279
up in any way it sits out wide open

128
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,680
until i'm confident in the dryness i'm

129
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,719
going to say dry a lot i'm also going to

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
talk about

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
desiccant packages i'm looking at some

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879
on my table i've got a little bag of

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,439
them over there do not confuse the

134
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,839
desiccant packs with a boveda pack we're

135
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,079
trying to suck out moisture the boveda

136
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
pack the other humidipacks those add

137
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,279
moisture we don't want to do that we

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,519
want to remove it all we don't want to

139
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,279
regulate it we want to eliminate it so

140
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,879
don't get confused on the packets get

141
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,959
the appropriate packet

142
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
desiccant pack dryness pack that's what

143
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,879
we're looking for

144
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,120
not a moisture packet once again so get

145
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,478
the bud super dry the way i like to do

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,038
it i've talked about this before i get

147
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,038
my plants my buds are completely dry and

148
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,038
i'll put them in a bin uh maybe a five

149
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,560
gallon bucket maybe a stir light bin

150
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,839
i'll put on gloves i'll crumble it up

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,079
maybe i'll use another method i've

152
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,679
talked about this get it dry remove the

153
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,359
seeds from that material we want it

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,519
super dry this is where we're going to

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
start talking about storing the seeds

156
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,639
they are super dry put them in a

157
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,560
container

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
if i've got a lot of seeds i will use a

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,839
small mason jar if i've got just a

160
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,199
number of seeds that i know won't last

161
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,799
very long i put them in a 3x3 uh jewelry

162
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
baggie it's just a baggie i get them

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
online they come from hobby lobby or

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,280
amazon a 3x3 square bag if you buy seeds

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
for me in the

166
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,638
regular packages that's what i'm talking

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
about one of those baggies

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
so depending on how many i have i either

169
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
use a glass jar maybe i'll use a smaller

170
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,279
glass vial or often times that three by

171
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,959
three baggie so get the seeds dry then

172
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,879
put them in the container which you wish

173
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,318
to store them in

174
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,839
eventually they need to go into

175
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
something that is light proof i just

176
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,279
said i put them in those baggies they

177
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,519
also go into another container for

178
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,519
storage which is dark so your container

179
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,279
uh you may want to choose something that

180
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,719
is opaque or what's the word that is

181
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,559
dark that will uh keep the light out you

182
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,560
want something colored or tinted or

183
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
eventually it should go into that we

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
want to store our seeds

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
in a package that we can make try to

186
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,079
make airtight and keep the light out

187
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
then we want to put that in somewhere

188
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,198
that is cool dry and dark we don't want

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,478
to get uh temperature swings we don't

190
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
want to get light on these plants we

191
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,000
don't want extreme heat we don't want

192
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,959
extreme cold so put your seeds in a

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,759
container whether a jar a baggie a vial

194
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,719
then a huge piece of advice label them

195
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,080
very

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,520
excessively clearly i put the cross so

197
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,719
let's say that i'm going to package up

198
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,159
some arise f1 seeds i would label it the

199
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,160
top would say arise f1 then it would say

200
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
golden goat to daybreaker then it would

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
have the date that those seeds were

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,879
packaged up so today is march something

203
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,360
fifth uh we would put march 17th on that

204
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,519
package so that it would say a rise f1

205
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
so i know which filial generation i

206
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,560
remember what the cross is there just

207
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
for a backup plan in case i don't

208
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,918
remember what a rise was or if i was

209
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,759
high when i wrote something down i have

210
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,120
another backup plan then i've got a date

211
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,479
so when i know when those seeds were

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,079
kind of harvested when i put them in

213
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,000
that baggie is a good enough time frame

214
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,439
for me it lets me know which batch they

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,439
were from that way if you guys have a

216
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,439
problem if i discover a problem i know

217
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
that this jar this bag of seeds is where

218
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,719
the problem lies we can crack that open

219
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,439
germ a bunch of those and see what

220
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,919
happens in there so clearly excessively

221
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,598
label your seeds

222
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,799
i like to put like i said the name of

223
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
the cross

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,120
the cross the date sometimes i know how

225
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,598
many seeds are in there sometimes i'll

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,800
do that if it's got some special notes

227
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,719
on it maybe i'll write that on the

228
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
packaging so label them

229
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
put them in a jar put them in a bag put

230
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,399
a desiccant pack in there something that

231
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
will suck up the moisture i'm gonna keep

232
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,038
saying dry you want the seeds dry

233
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
moisture is a nightmare for a seed

234
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,719
moisture will ruin the seed moisture

235
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
will make the seed grow and until you're

236
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
ready don't get it wet so

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
put it in a jar put it in a bag with

238
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,800
your desiccant pack now let's keep the

239
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,680
temperatures consistent cool is better

240
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,639
frozen is not ideal hot is not good at

241
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,199
all i like to store my seeds in a cool

242
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720
dry dark environment i don't want the

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,120
seeds really cold i don't want them

244
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
really hot basically if i am comfortable

245
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
those seeds are probably comfortable as

246
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,000
well maybe a little bit colder than room

247
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,158
temperature maybe low 70s high 60s would

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
be good for storing your seeds some

249
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,360
people like to keep them in the

250
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,839
refrigerator let's talk about that for a

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,839
little bit cool is good but i don't like

252
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,519
to freeze them the refrigerator would be

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,680
cool uh put them in your jar or a baggie

254
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
then i put mine inside of a grateful

255
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,278
dead lunchbox i know that sounds [ __ ]

256
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,839
cliche the white hippie with dreadlocks

257
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,600
keeps his magic beans in a grateful dead

258
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
lunch box in the refrigerator yes it's

259
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
one of those metal lunch boxes

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
it's got the little metal clasp on the

261
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,120
front you pop it open there's a [ __ ] ton

262
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,639
of seed packs in there close it back up

263
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,159
throw it in the fridge it stays in the

264
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,519
crisper drawer that's mainly where i

265
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,079
keep those seeds don't come to get it

266
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
they are well protected uh but the seeds

267
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
my seeds tend to stay in the crisper

268
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,480
drawer they marry all there may also be

269
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
a safe somewhere that is in a cool dark

270
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
place that does not get a lot of

271
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
temperature swings a lot of the seeds

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
stay in the safe the safe is always dark

273
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,278
the temperature there is basically

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
always the same because of the location

275
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,639
keep it in a place where you can keep

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,039
the temperature kind of regulated let's

277
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,799
talk about why uh the temperature is

278
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,240
important and why why i don't like the

279
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,559
freezer and why possibly the

280
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
refrigerator may not be the choice for

281
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,679
you

282
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,399
if you are the kind of person that likes

283
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,559
to

284
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
uh open and close your seeds and show

285
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,399
your friends all your packages the

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
fridge or the freezer is not the spot

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
because think about what happens if you

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
put a food product in the refrigerator

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
and then you take it out it develops

290
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,959
condensation on the outside of the

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
package i was looking at one of my

292
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,838
drinks here to see if it was it's too uh

293
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,838
the temperature is just right in this

294
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
room there's no condensation

295
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,560
so when you take a drink out of the

296
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
fridge right there's no condensation on

297
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,359
your bottle you take that bottle out of

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,039
the fridge you crack it open take a few

299
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
drinks you go to grab the bottle again

300
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,439
it's got condensation on it

301
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
maybe possibly that could happen to our

302
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
seeds if we put them in the fridge get

303
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
them nice and cold pull them out show

304
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,799
them off to your friends they may be

305
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,399
getting exposed to condensation or

306
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,479
moisture within that packaging there

307
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,078
could be moisture in the package i don't

308
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
know how dry your seeds were i don't

309
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,519
know who sold them to you who packaged

310
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
them i don't know the moisture content

311
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
of your seeds before they were packaged

312
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,519
in the fridge that moisture could

313
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
could become condensation when you take

314
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,320
it out that could be detrimental to your

315
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,839
seeds in the freezer that moisture could

316
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,760
rupture your seeds if there's enough

317
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
moisture with inside with the inside of

318
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,879
that seed and it does freeze if it

319
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,879
reaches a certain temperature that could

320
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,278
explode and pop the seed

321
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,559
i have seen seeds get allegedly get

322
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,720
shipped from

323
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,799
colorado to new york in the winter they

324
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
exploded in the bay of the [ __ ] cargo

325
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,240
plane all the seeds were ruptured uh

326
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
they had too much moisture in them it

327
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
was winter they popped inside there like

328
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,600
[ __ ] bubble wrap and popcorn most of

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
those seeds were toasted they were

330
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,759
toasted they were opposite of toasted

331
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,519
they were frozen to [ __ ] so if you're

332
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,120
gonna put the seeds in the fridge leave

333
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,440
them there until it's time to grow them

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
don't be the person and it's it's okay i

335
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
love to marvel at my seed collection

336
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
i've got some seeds and i'll pull them

337
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,759
out and i'll look at them be like oh

338
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
there's my i've got all of the sub cool

339
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,039
stuff all of the tga stuff from before

340
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
subcool passed i'll pull it out just

341
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,000
look at it and just read the names and

342
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,919
look at all the cool [ __ ] that i've

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
gotten miss my buddy sub and it's like

344
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,639
looking at your baseball cards or your

345
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
sneaker collection or whatever you're

346
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,439
into your video games or your hats or

347
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,039
whatever you're into your purses if

348
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
that's your thing

349
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,759
a lot of people like to look at their

350
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
collection and share it show their

351
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,439
friends and the bros come over and

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,879
you're like i got this and i got oh yeah

353
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
i got this from this company and i got

354
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,078
this and you just show it off and maybe

355
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,360
you're doing trading or whatever if

356
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,719
you're going to do that bring them out a

357
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,159
lot don't put them in the fridge because

358
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
then you do run that risk that

359
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,399
opportunity that potential for

360
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,600
condensation every time you move them

361
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,679
every time you take them out put them

362
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
back in you do give them that

363
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,078
opportunity also you're making heat and

364
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
cold fluctuations that's going to cause

365
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,359
problems that's a living organism that

366
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,559
you're trying to preserve when it gets

367
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
warm it's probably going to start

368
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,679
thinking oh we're going to germinate

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
we're going to go in then you put it

370
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,958
back in the fridge and confuse the [ __ ]

371
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,078
out of it i don't know if that's real i

372
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,599
don't know if it's got that kind of

373
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,039
memory but that is something that i

374
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,278
would think about try to keep your

375
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,639
temperature consistent no spikes no

376
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,120
humidity spikes definitely no

377
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,799
condensation no moisture again i would

378
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
not recommend freezing them but a lot of

379
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
people do that and it does work i have

380
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,759
stored seeds for

381
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,680
years in this method uh in a baggie

382
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,439
in the lunch box in the crisper drawer

383
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,120
the fridge i've had seeds in there for a

384
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
long time i bust them out they germinate

385
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,759
very well so that seems to be a good

386
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,920
method for me

387
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,759
um if you are one of those people that

388
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,360
insists on showing your seeds to all of

389
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,519
your friends and you want to store them

390
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,039
in your refrigerator this may be a

391
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
better way to do things anyway just

392
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,559
because um

393
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
just adds a level of security to

394
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,719
yourself and your collection and also it

395
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
keeps your friends honest and it doesn't

396
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
allow for any questions maybe consider

397
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
just taking all of your seeds one time

398
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,278
and making a fat list of them and saying

399
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
like categorize them i read genetics

400
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,360
i've got all of this ah miss jill i've

401
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
got all of this whatever other brands

402
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
and breeders you're into make a strip

403
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
make a breeder and then list all the

404
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,240
[ __ ] you've got from them and then maybe

405
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,000
put regs and fems and then how many

406
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
seeds are in each pack you're real ocd

407
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,039
about it if you want to then when it

408
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
comes time to show off your trading or

409
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,919
your seeds or talk about trading you

410
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,200
don't have to bring out the stash and

411
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,399
show everybody you just show them the

412
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
list

413
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,879
or take pictures of all your cool [ __ ]

414
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
and show everybody your pictures

415
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,480
that way once again when it comes time

416
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
to trade or sell seeds you don't have to

417
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,159
bring it all out

418
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,240
things can't disappear things can't walk

419
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,919
away people can't accidentally take a

420
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
pack that they didn't trade for if you

421
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,879
only give them a picture of what you've

422
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,680
got available i'm not saying your

423
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,519
friends are going to steal from you but

424
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,799
who knows one time somebody stole some

425
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
seeds from me i know who you are

426
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,679
[ __ ] guess what i don't call you

427
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
no more i didn't say anything about it

428
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,439
we just don't hang out hope the seeds

429
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,958
was worth it because in the long run

430
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
dude you would have made so much [ __ ]

431
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,278
more money than stealing a [ __ ] pack

432
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
of seeds from me but guess what

433
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,320
you're not on the team all right so

434
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
where do we go from there um i really

435
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
don't have a lot more notes i think i've

436
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,399
covered the basics of storing seeds keep

437
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,319
them in a cool dry dark place somewhere

438
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,078
secure somewhere safe seeds are valuable

439
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,760
you guys work hard for your money i

440
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,759
recommend a safe if you've got a metal

441
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,919
gun safe or something like that

442
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,000
that is a great spot lock them up under

443
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,679
lock and key is the best place

444
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,278
don't bring them all out don't tell

445
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,278
people where you're keeping them that is

446
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,480
my advice take a lot of pictures of your

447
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,919
seed packs that way if you want to share

448
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,839
it with your friends you got all the

449
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,958
pictures there you remember what you've

450
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,199
got you don't have to pull it out of the

451
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,679
stash all the time document what you've

452
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,039
got write down on the seed packs maybe

453
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,198
if they're packs you bought if they're

454
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,639
seeds you made write down the date on

455
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,479
that package when you got it if you're

456
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,639
making a spreadsheet when you got those

457
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,480
put a date on there so that you know how

458
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,159
old those seeds are also maybe write

459
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,480
down where you got them

460
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,078
there are some uh vendors that do have

461
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
older seeds some vendors with newer

462
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,479
seeds unfortunately there are some

463
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,399
vendors with fugazi seeds people are

464
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
buying uh just buckets of seeds or

465
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,559
people are just making seeds they

466
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,040
wouldn't stop anybody a seed company a

467
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,958
seed bank uh the banks are the people

468
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,559
that sell the seeds the breeders are the

469
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,239
people that make them all right so a

470
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,559
company makes them the the banks sell

471
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,399
them nobody would

472
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,919
there's nothing stopping from somebody

473
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
making a bucket of seeds and just

474
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,278
putting them in packages and saying that

475
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,159
these are this brand seeds we've seen it

476
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,519
done

477
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,958
there's a company that's done it to miss

478
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,159
jill they've done it to myself they've

479
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,319
done it to a lot of the people in the

480
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,399
industry they claim to be selling ivory

481
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
genetics or miss jill genetics and it's

482
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
honestly just [ __ ] that they made and

483
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,799
they have no idea what the seeds really

484
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,639
are they just package it up and they

485
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,919
sell it then the consumer buys it and

486
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
they send me an email saying hey i

487
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,039
bought seeds from this company i grew

488
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,479
the plants and they look like [ __ ] and

489
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,319
i'll say well that's funny because i've

490
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
never sold any seeds to that company

491
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
they must not have sold you real irig

492
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
genetics and i do apologize so uh pay

493
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,320
attention to where you're getting the

494
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,078
seeds

495
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,440
so write down where your seeds came from

496
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,359
write down the date which you got them

497
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,959
that way if you run into problems you do

498
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,680
have some sort of history some sort of

499
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,359
timeline to go back on a lot of us are

500
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,359
consuming a lot of cannabis a lot of us

501
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,039
are just late night internet shoppers we

502
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
buy our seeds at random times we don't

503
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,078
remember exactly when and where we

504
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
bought some [ __ ] so write down on the

505
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,519
package a lot of the packages are fairly

506
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,278
large or if you've got your spreadsheet

507
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,879

508
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,399

510
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,559
if you're really ocd write down what you

511
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
paid for them just for fun because you

512
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,399

market move up and down right now some

514
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
seeds that were worth a thousand dollars

515
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,439
last year are not worth much this year

516
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
and then seeds that weren't worth [ __ ]

517
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
last year are worth a lot this year it's

518
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959

that move up and down all right i really

523
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,159
feel like i've rambled out this episode

524
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,439
this could have been a longer episode

525
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,360
but there's no need to stretch it out

526
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,360
i've covered the topic keep your seeds

527
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
in a cool dry dark place i put them in a

528
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,159
jar or a baggie i throw that jar or

529
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,519
baggie into a grateful dead lunch box if

530
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,198
you're into pokemon if you're into

531
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,480
powerpuff girls if you're into the x-men

532
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,399
if you're into wolverine

533
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,798
whatever kind of lunchbox you've got

534
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
that will work for you i've seen a lot

535
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,078
of people use a tackle box or something

536
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
similar put it in a box that is going to

537
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,879
keep the light off of the seeds put

538
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
those in the crisper drawer of the

539
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,559
fridge or if you live in a cool place

540
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,719
where it doesn't get too hot too cold

541
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,558
you can keep them in a drawer i prefer a

542
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
safe tour it's nice and locked in

543
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,000
colorado the basement stays great here

544
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
if you've got a safe in the basement in

545
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
colorado i'd recommend putting your

546
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,840
seeds in a safe in the basement they'll

547
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,160
be great year-round the temperatures

548
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,359
