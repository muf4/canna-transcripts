in the video description all right

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,118
i do want to start the show by uh saying

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
uh that a few of my friends have

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,280
mentioned something that i think is

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
funny

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,199
i have decided that when you overflow

65
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,680
the reservoir at a new grow

66
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,280
you have simply baptized the place with

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
your new presence that is now

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,000
your new grow it's like i licked it it's

69
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,759
mine or i peed on it it is mine

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
that is what happens when you overflow

71
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,120
the reservoir at a grow

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
the first time you do it that is your

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
new place the second time you do it

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,719
uh we got to figure out an excuse for

75
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,159
that the third time set a [ __ ] timer

76
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
and quit taking so many dabs on your

77
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,519
break but the first time you overflowed

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
that reservoir

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,120
welcome to your new grow that is a

80
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,878
christening uh that is a rite of passage

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
it's funny the first time

82
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,479
it's a real [ __ ] the second time but

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,159
the third time it gets embarrassing

84
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,000
i wanted to give a shout out to a friend

85
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,280
who overflowed his reservoir

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
uh you're not gonna get your name said

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
but bro big shout out much respect

88

of that stuff happens

by me i do offer a product

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
called table seeds um they're not

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,680
available on a website or anything if

112
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,039
you get seeds

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
through some avenues through some

114
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,158
auctions or some raffles or perhaps a

115
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
waffle

116
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,280
they do offer table seeds as a bonus

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
let me take a moment to describe what

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
table seeds are before we get into this

119
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,158
message

120
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
table seeds are just exactly what they

121
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,878
sound like

122
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,878
let's say hypothetically i was sitting

123
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,598
at this table and i was packing up

124
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,919
a bunch of seed packages and i put a

125
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,598
package of whatever seeds into a bowl

126
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,399
and then i dispersed those seeds from a

127
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,719
bowl into ten packs or into five packs

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
sometimes when i'm done as i'm cleaning

129
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,918
up i discover

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
seeds on the table guess what those get

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
labeled those are now what are known as

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
table seeds

133
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,560
unknown soldiers if i've worked with a

134
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,039
couple of strains over the course of the

135
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,478
day

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
and we clean up at the end of the day i

137
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,079
may find 10 or 12 seeds and i don't know

138
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,918
which bag they came from

139
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,279
i do not give them a name i'm not that

140
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,959
kind of guy i don't just

141
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,478
assign them a name i don't just pick a

142
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,799
bag for them to go into

143
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,959
i don't just fake it for you i actually

144
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,439
set them aside they go into another bowl

145
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,198
that is labeled table seeds just all the

146
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,160
random seeds i clean up off the table

147
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
maybe i found it

148
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,439
tucked under the side of the computer

149
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,039
maybe it rolled off that way

150
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,639
maybe i just don't know which bag it

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,840
came out of instead of trying to fake it

152
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,439
like i said earlier

153
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,959
i don't lie to you i don't cheat you i

154
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,439
don't rip you off it gets assigned the

155
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,839
word

156
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,199
table seeds then when you buy seeds at a

157
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,478
waffle or an action

158
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
yes we do be careful with some of the

159
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,560
words we say it's just jokes there

160
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,720
when you do buy stuff in a waffle or an

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,478
action i do send you extra table seeds

162
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
as a bonus as a thank you

163
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,159
that's just my way of giving you more

164
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,519
[ __ ] you do get bonus packs every time

165
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
you shop with me but

166
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
i will send you extra table seeds if

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
i've got them uh they're low right now

168
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,319
so i stop doing it

169
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
once they pile back up and i've got more

170
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,639
to make it worth our time and energy i

171
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,000
will put the table seeds back in the mix

172
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,439
now that you know what table seeds are

173
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,079
oh the beauty about table seeds let's

174
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,879
talk about

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,199
how magical table seeds are they could

176
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,918
be

177
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
anything in my lineup it could be

178
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,120
anything i've ever

179
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
released it could be anything i've never

180
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,079
released it could be stuff you've heard

181
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
of a thousand times

182
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,918
it could be [ __ ] you have never heard of

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,639
anything any seed that has ever crossed

184
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,719
this table

185
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
has the potential to end up as a table

186
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,600
seed if i drop

187
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,719
if i've got a congo to arise or uh jack

188
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
the ripper to

189
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
oh let's not say too many things right

190
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,240
jack the ripper to lemon skunk maybe i

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
dropped one of those seeds and it rolled

192
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
off somewhere and i found it later

193
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,198
that's in the table seed mix and i don't

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
even know what it is they could be rags

195
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
they could be fems it's kinda

196
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,279
irie genetics bag seed is close to what

197
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,198
that is you know it's from me

198
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,038
but you don't know if it which male or

199
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,038
female was involved in that mix

200
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,279
in any way so those are table seeds they

201
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,759
could be anything from my lineup it

202
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,359
could be a feminized cross it could be a

203
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
king solomon cross it could be a jack

204
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
the ripper cross it could be an old

205
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
daybreaker cross it could be a king chem

206
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,439
grape stomper cross it could be

207
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
anything out of my lineup i think i made

208
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,399
enough

209
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
stress on that so this question stems

210
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,159
from the table seeds

211
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
this one came from our friend grow can

212
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
advocate it looks like this one came

213
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,879
over

214
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,478
patreon i do think big you big thank you

215
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,719

216
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,000

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,840
thank you enough for the wisdom

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240

219
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,000

220
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
ah thank you those compliments those

221
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,879

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,439
so thank you it says we're we are a

223
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,199
better

224
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,800
community because of you i don't know

225
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
that i'm making a better community but

226
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
if you say so

227
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,519
that's humbling that is awesome i'm

228
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
going to politely take the compliment

229
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,240
but i don't know that i mean maybe i did

230
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,079
make the whole community better there's

231
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
a really cool chill vibe in the discord

232
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,879
so go hang on go see the community we

233
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
did create you're right bro i'll quit

234
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,439
fighting with you

235
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
it goes on though it says here is my

236
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,680
question as a patreon supporter i've

237
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,359
tried to hang out on the discord channel

238
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
and learn from all of the fine folks in

239
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
the irie army and i've even had the

240
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
chance to win

241
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,318
one of the seed auctions a few months

242
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,478
back yes allegedly possibly

243
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
there may be some seed auctions over on

244
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,279
the discord we got to be careful what we

245
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
say on youtube

246
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,359
but allegedly that could be a thing it

247
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,799
says i'm currently growing iri genetics

248
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,038
blue raspberry truffle

249
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,598
and in the package i got a handful of 10

250
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,360
or fifth notes is 15 or 20

251
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,038
table seeds which is funny because they

252
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
come in packs of 10

253
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,038
and you got 15 or 20 which means i was

254
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
generous with your table seeds i just

255
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,560
like to give you extra [ __ ]

256
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,039
money is expensive and when you guys

257
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,959
choose to spend your hard-earned money

258
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,318
especially during the past year and a

259
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,079
half two years we've had

260
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,080
when we're not absolutely sure where the

261
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,758
next nickel and dime could come from

262
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,240
money is extra expensive and when you

263
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,038
chose to spend your hard-earned money

264
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,519
your scarce money with my company on my

265
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,878

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,038
thousands of other breeders out there

269
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,439
there are thousands of other breeders on

270
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,719
the same website where you buy my [ __ ]

271
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,319
so taking the uh the just buying my

272
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,240
brand and supporting my brand it means a

273
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,200
lot to me so i want to make sure you get

274
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,639
more than what you paid for um that's if

275
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
you get what you paid for

276
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,158
you feel good if you don't get what you

277
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
paid for you feel kind of angry but if

278
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,360
you get extra you're like damn i'm gonna

279
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
go back there again it's just inviting

280
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
it's encouraging and i want to show you

281
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
that

282
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
i'm appreciative for it um i don't know

283
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
i've i've been given a gift

284
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,519
i don't talk about spirituality and

285
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
stuff but uh i'm rich

286
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,720
spiritually and all that [ __ ] so i'm i'm

287
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
ready to give you more when you spend

288
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
your money with you with me that's what

289
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
i want to do make sure you feel the

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,278
customer service

291
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
so you got 15 or 20 table seeds in your

292
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,439
10 pack is where that ramble stemmed

293
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,159
from

294
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,080
goes on to say here is my question since

295
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,919
the table seeds are unknown strains but

296
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
otherwise good genetics i was going to

297
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,319
run

298
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
all of them at once and do a fino hunt

299
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
that's a really good strategy but then i

300
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
got to thinking

301
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
is there anything wrong or unethical

302
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
about breeding with them

303
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,639
i'm in prohibition land so i'm

304
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,559
personally not in it to make a bunch of

305
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,000
seeds and sell them

306
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,759
as a breeder how would you feel if

307
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
somebody took your table seeds and kept

308
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,360
the genetics going by breeding them

309
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,879
maybe even finding something pretty cool

310
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
oh you'll find something pretty [ __ ]

311
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,320
cool in there uh

312
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
what's the right thing to do with naming

313
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,080
anything that comes out of this i can

314
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,839
see this from both sides

315
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
as a breeder i wouldn't want my name on

316
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
stuff that i couldn't control the

317
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
outcomes

318
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,199
but on the flip side if it comes from

319
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,680
stock that i've put my heart and soul

320
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
into

321
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,519
i'd want to make sure it's legit so if

322
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,120
you tell me to [ __ ] off

323
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,278
bro i would never tell anybody to [ __ ]

324
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,799
off uh this is i've got full respect

325
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,639
no matter what your idea is i'll sit

326
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,399
down and have a conversation with you so

327
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,159
never [ __ ] off always approach me with a

328
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
smile and be ready for a friendly

329
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,759
uh conversation maybe we'll smoke a dab

330
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
however we gotta do it we'll find a

331
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,159
resolution that is friendly that we can

332
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
advocate all right this is a very good

343
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,559
question it gives me the opportunity to

344
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,639
talk about a couple things here

345
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,239
this person is asking if they can breed

346
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,480
with the table seeds first

347
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
question the first question is can i

348
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
breed with your seeds is basically what

349
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
they're asking

350
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,759
yes i encourage support

351
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,440
promote uh endorse you breeding with my

352
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,958
seeds if i made the seeds

353
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
and you acquired them through a

354
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,159
reasonable ethical

355
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,399
moral method if you didn't steal them

356
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,559
rip somebody off or lie to get them

357
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,078
i encourage you to breed with them have

358
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,799
a good time those are your

359
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,319
seeds ah you paid money for them

360
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,838
somebody's got money for them either

361
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,519
myself or the vendor that sold them to

362
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
you or the bro that sold them to you

363
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,399
somebody made some money once they left

364
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,200
my hands i have no say-so no control

365
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,879
ah no real i i care that you have a

366
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
successful outcome but other than that i

367
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,159
can't really care too much about what

368
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,879
you do with them i can't stay attached

369
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,120
to them

370
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,958
uh once i accepted money they're yours i

371
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
can't make rules on [ __ ] people

372
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,559
paid me money for uh that's when you

373
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,078
tell me to [ __ ] off when i take your

374
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,958
money and give you rules that's when i

375
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,278
[ __ ] off that's

376
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,199
that's how that should go so i encourage

377
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,120
it i promote it i endorse it i support

378
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
it please do breed with the seeds that

379
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
you get from me

380
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,360
that is cool i bred with seeds i got

381
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
from other growers i bred with seeds and

382
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
clones that came from other breeders

383
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,919
i did not invent cannabis i didn't just

384
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
meditate one day and manifest

385
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,838
a batch of seeds i had to start with

386
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,278
seeds or clones that came from another

387
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,480
grower another gardener which was

388
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,480
another breeder

389
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
so i didn't invent seeds i didn't invent

390
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,959
cannabis and i

391
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,078
feel no way territorial or uh protective

392
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,599
of the plant or of

393
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,439
i do feel protective of the plant but

394
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,240
not of the breeding you should be able

395
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
to play freely just like i do there are

396
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,759
seeds there are grow lights have a good

397
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,639
time you've got my blessings

398
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,480
um yeah i didn't invent this plant so i

399
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
can't stop you i want you to breed maybe

400
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
you'll make better [ __ ] than me that

401
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,160
would be

402
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
awesome i would be really delighted and

403
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,919
proud to see you

404
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,679
use one of my packs of seeds and make

405
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,759
something better than anything i've ever

406
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,759
done that would make me happy

407
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,120
as a teacher as a breeder i'm not going

408
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,360
to be around forever i don't expect to

409
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,278
[ __ ] live forever i need people to be

410
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,278
a good grower better breeders i have to

411
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,720
pass this torch eventually

412
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,399
there were breeders that taught me how

413
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
to do this i hope to teach you

414
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
the same way also i hope to teach you

415
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,159
good ethics and good morals within

416
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,879
breeding so let's talk about that part

417
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,958
now

418
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,078
you can use my stuff you've got my full

419
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,159
permission when you do

420
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,599
that it would be cool and this is a

421
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,278
special case because these are table

422
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
seeds if you use any of my seeds that

423
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,919
you know what they are

424
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:05,039
just say that was strawberry starburst

425
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,078
cross to whatever you used just put give

426
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,240
credit to it just

427
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,559
be honest don't lie and say that secret

428
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,240
strain a to secret stream b

429
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,159
first of all the community doesn't trust

430
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
you doesn't want that but second of all

431
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,199
that's a dick move give

432
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
us credit if you notice my packages of

433
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,879
seeds it always says

434
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,759
this crossed to this i want you to know

435
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,000
that that was

436
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,958
sub cools jack the ripper across to my

437
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,078
arise or

438
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,439
however it went crockett's uh strawberry

439
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,439
fields to my

440
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,279
daybreaker whatever i did i want you to

441
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
know that way i'm not lying to anybody

442
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,879
misleading anybody

443
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,958
uh they're also i'm giving credit to the

444
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,320
people who i'm using their work that's

445
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,278
important also

446
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,120
medical smokers are looking for relief

447
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,480
and they know certain strains help them

448
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,320
so if they see that

449
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
maybe og kush is something that works

450
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
great for a person and then strawberry

451
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,360
something if it's got strawberry in it

452
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
maybe it works really good for a person

453
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
if they can look through the genetic

454
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,480
history and see this has og cushion

455
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,838
strawberry on one side and og cushion

456
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,000
the terps on the other side

457
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
it may they know how to map out their

458
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,120
medicine a little bit that way it gives

459
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,599
them a hint it gives them a clue at what

460
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,278
to select for their medical consumption

461
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
so i think it's important for several

462
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,639
reasons that we label these plants

463
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,278
properly correctly with the crosses and

464
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,039
honor

465
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,278
the original breeders that made those

466
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,919
plants i feel that anything you learn

467
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,439
it's very important to honor the source

468
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,479
we aren't [ __ ] wizards most of us

469
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
learn from google

470
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
so you'll hear me say a lot of times

471
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,879
things like i learned that from mr soul

472
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
or i read this in soma's book i feel

473
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,600
like it's important to teach

474
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
those sources that way you guys have the

475
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
opportunity as well to say oh you

476
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
learned it from mr soul then you go

477
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,919
research mr soul

478
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,120
and then you find out more you learn

479
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,319
where i'm learning and then you get a

480
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
deeper understanding and then we can

481
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,920
learn together

482
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,679
i think it's important so um i do feel

483
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,759
that it is okay to breed with my seeds i

484
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,359
encourage it i didn't invent them

485
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,639
uh the ethics would be to uh put

486
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,159
normally you would just put the strain

487
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,198
name but these are table seeds so you're

488
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,600
gonna have to put

489
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,359
um i regi just put table seeds by

490
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
iriegenetics in the description you know

491
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,278
what i mean

492
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,958
and then i always write a nice story

493
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,559
about my strain so it would just say i

494
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,679
acquired some table seeds from my buddy

495
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,919
irie genetics or

496
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,679
roster jeff at iregenetics i found a

497
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,198
keeper in there with these traits and

498
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,039
described the traits

499
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,240
maybe just maybe i can identify what

500
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,399
you've got i'm not gonna

501
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,680
100 percent say that i can but once it's

502
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,278
in flower maybe

503
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,198
through visual descriptions through some

504
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,039
aroma descriptions we can identify what

505
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,838
you've got i'm very familiar with my

506
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,319
lineup

507
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
but you can honor it by saying it is a

508
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
table seed from ross to jeff from ire

509
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,120
genetics i crossed it to this and this

510
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,639
is what i'm doing

511
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,480
and then the really cool thing to do

512
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
would be send me a 10 pack but you know

513
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,278
that's not required

514
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,800
i don't have space to grow it right now

515
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,000
but you know if you find something fire

516
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,679
and you breed it and you send it back to

517
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
me and then i grow that and i breed it

518
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,439
to something

519
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,039
i promise you i send seeds back to you

520
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
so that's how that that works out

521
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,719
i do keep my friends in mind when i'm

522
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,320
working with the stuff they send me

523
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
wow that was a lot of rambling so where

524
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
do we go from here um

525
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,759
what's the right thing to do with naming

526
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,439
anything that comes out of this bro name

527
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,720
it whatever you want you've got my

528
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,000
blessing my honor

529
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,278
name it something that is cool to you

530
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,039
don't uh if you want to honor my line

531
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,399
and my work you can put something in

532
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,159
there that would sort of

533
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
give a hint of where it came from you

534
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,240
could give pay homage to it through the

535
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
name i sort of try to do that with some

536
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
stuff

537
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,600
also blueberry butcher is

538
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,958
jack the ripper it's got jack the ripper

539
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
in there that's why the word butcher

540
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,198
ended up in there it just sounds like

541
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,559
blueberry killing you

542
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,838
jack the ripper and it's got blueberry

543
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,919
cookies on one side uh blueberry butcher

544
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
so i honored the jack the ripper in

545
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
there um

546
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,120
arise got called a rise because

547
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,720
it has got daybreaker as the male and

548
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,159
daybreaker comes from gage green

549
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,199
genetics and they name

550
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:47,360
a lot of their stuff one word like

551
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,879
uplifting positive words and i just kept

552
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,278
with the theme i didn't steal a word

553
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,679
they were using arise was actually

554
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,360
submitted by a social media fan they

555
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,799
said arise would be a cool strain name

556
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,519
and i was like i'm going to use it

557
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,039
so we used a rise it pays tribute to the

558
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,679
original breeder that bred one of the

559
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,120
strains

560
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,038
it honors that it continues that

561
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,119
tradition but it's also my own

562
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,318
thing so that's where the name arise

563
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,038
came from i don't know if you ever knew

564
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,639
that

565
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,240
um yeah so honor me maybe by putting

566
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
something with my or just name it

567
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,919
something whatever you want

568
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,599
uh if you're into transformers name it

569
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,679
after a [ __ ] transformer if you're

570
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,879
into electronic stuff name it after some

571
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,000
electronic [ __ ]

572
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
uh your grow can advocate do name it

573
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
something

574
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
after your cannabis activism or

575
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,919
something i don't know man have fun with

576
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
the name creation you get to name it

577
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,120
whatever

578
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
you want that is part of the beauty of

579
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,479
naming strains

580
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
i really like to have fun with my naming

581
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
schemes sometimes i drive myself crazy

582
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,240
because i've got the perfect name for a

583
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,038
strain but i still insist that it isn't

584
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
perfect

585
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,079
it doesn't sound like you're trying to

586
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,519
make seeds for a market so the name

587
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,480
won't be

588
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,319
as critical sometimes i feel like a name

589
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
the name of a strain can dictate the

590
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,879
success or

591
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,719
failure of that strain it can be fire

592
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,320
and if it's got a bad name it just won't

593
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
sell for some reason

594
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,079
sometimes things on the market don't

595
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,279
have the they're not the best product

596
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,599
but they've got a good name and they

597
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
just sell because of the name so

598
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,439
i always struggle with the perfect name

599
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
i like to crowdsource names a little bit

600
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
see what people think i try to come up

601
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
with my own stuff but they let the crowd

602
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,360
kind of weigh in a little bit because

603
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,440
they're the ones buying it

604
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,479
but come up with a name that means

605
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,160
something to you

606
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,440
something that you smile or you grin or

607
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
you giggle or you feel some sort of

608
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,038
pride every time you say that name

609
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
and then if you're not gonna put it out

610
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,679
to market it doesn't have to be

611
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,960
something catchy that's gonna

612
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
catch the market you can name it

613
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
whatever you want it's just yours

614
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,159
so name the strain whatever feels good

615
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
to you whatever is fun to you

616
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
uh maybe if you got a family or

617
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,558
something or somebody helping you grow

618
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,519
it maybe they've got a name suggestion

619
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,200
maybe you guys can

620
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,400
compile your names combine your names

621
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
together come up with something cool

622
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,759
it's like making up a band name

623
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,918
uh this is always fun for me i love this

624
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,960
kind of stuff so i think i covered the

625
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
basics of

626
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,160
your question you do have the uh the

627
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,319
blessing to breed with my stuff

628
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240
um just put that it's an irie genetics

629
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,079
table seed in there or an irie genetics

630
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,279
however you want to label it

631
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,639
technically if you're not going to sell

632
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,599
it or do anything with it you don't have

633
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,080
to really

634
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,000
worry about that honestly but it's just

635
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,159
a irie genetics table seed crossed to

636
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
whatever you choose to cross it with

637
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,840
name it whatever you want have fun if

638
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
you want some strained name ideas let me

639
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,519
know what you're working with also let's

640
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,960
try to identify this plant

641
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,279
i don't know how to send pictures on

642
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,798
cannabi or on patreon yet

643
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,399
it doesn't let me attach pictures but

644
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,798
send them to me through my email

645
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,798
grow from your heart at hotmail.com uh

646
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,319
maybe as it's early in flower later in

647
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,200
flower i may be able to help you

648
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,519
identify

649
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,558
exactly what you're growing maybe uh i

650
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,480
can hear some

651
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,519
descriptions of the aromas we'll see

652
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
what you're working with we'll be able

653
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,639
to tell by how long it takes to flower

654
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,558
the leaf shape the colors

655
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,679
some aromas we may be able to at least

656
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,678
narrow down

657
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,679
some options of what you may have in

658
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
your garden grow can advocate

659
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
i rambled for a long time about that i

660
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,038
really hope i answered your question bro

661
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,038
breed with my stuff

662
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,319
everybody out there have fun breeding

663
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,480
breed with my stuff

664
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,399
uh even if you've got a seed company

665
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,759
breed with some of my stuff don't uh

666
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,759
don't just straight take a male and

667
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,440
start a seed company

668
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,359
take a male take a female breed

669
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
something select a male from that use

670
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,119
your own male that's been worked

671
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
then make a seed company out of that

672
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,439
would be cool but you've got my

673
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,839
blessings

674
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
um i'm not worried about it i'm honored

675
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,720
that you choose to work with my stuff

676
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
there's some good breeding stock in

677
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
there

678
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,159
so don't be shy all right i feel like i

679
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,759
do have more messages how long have we

680
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,520
been going we do have time for another

681
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,000
one this may be a long episode which is

682
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,079
cool i owe you guys a long one this time

683
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,599
where are we this one comes from our

684
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,199
friend they want their name said their

685
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,719
name is not listed so we're gonna skip

686
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
that and keep them anonymous big shout

687
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
out to my friend you'll know who you are

688
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
it says hey jeff i love this show i

689
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
asked a question during the premiere

690
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,158
and you asked me to email it to you i do

691
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
remember this i was watching the

692
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,480
premiere on youtube the show does

693
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,519

on youtube at 12 o'clock mountain time

695
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,639
it's midnight

696
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,559
uh mountain time it is going from

697
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,600
wednesday to thursday so it's

698
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:05,279
um it's technically 11 59

699
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,119
wednesday into 12 thursday at midnight

700
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,038
uh mountain time is when these shows

701
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,959
come out i do the premiere on youtube

702
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,720
i do wednesday and monday so it'll be

703
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
wednesday and monday sorry it's sunday

704
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
into monday and wednesday into thursday

705
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
is when the premieres come out at

706
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,480
midnight

707
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
i hang out quite often in the premiere

708
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
in the chat with my friends and i watch

709
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,480
the chat

710
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,240
and i talk with the guys and gals that

711
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,079
are there and we [ __ ] a little bit

712
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
during that chat our friend did ask us

713
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,960
this question

714
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,480
there was no way for me to remember it

715
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
or capture it there in the chat so i

716
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
said please email it

717
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,279
this is what we got it says could you do

718
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
a segment

719
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,119
or an episode on um and i have to be

720
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,798
careful with the words i use because i

721
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,319
mentioned this before we did have

722
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,079
a friend whose channel got flagged

723
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,279
because they used an inappropriate word

724
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,038
which is really funny because they're

725
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,119
using it appropriately but

726
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,279
algorithms will get you in trouble um

727
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,199
can we talk about intersex plants and

728
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,399
finding nanners on plants those aren't

729
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,759
the words on the paper here but i'm

730
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,080
trying to be careful

731
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,679
uh do you know how long until nanners

732
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,199
develop pollen or can you explain if

733
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
there's a difference on when nanners

734
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
show up

735
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,080
during week three or when they show up

736
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,240
on week five etc

737
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,079
do you keep them or do you chop based on

738
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
these circumstances so this is a very

739
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,639
good question

740
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,558
uh when you're working with some of the

741
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,600
new common varietals out there

742
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,038
it is not uncommon to discover intersex

743
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,798
plants that is a plant that

744
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
appears to be female and then at some

745
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,200
point in that plant's life it throws out

746
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,679
male

747
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,600
flowers when that plant throws out male

748
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
flowers you've got a decision to make

749
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,319
and that's what this question is all

750
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,000
about

751
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,839
how do we handle these plants that

752
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,759
suddenly tell us that they are

753
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,399
intersex plants we thought we had female

754
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,279
plants a lot of og cush and chem stuff

755
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,320
will have

756
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,599
a tendency to throw some nanners on you

757
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,599
because that comes from

758
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,879
somewhere down the line in the chems and

759
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,000
the og cushes

760
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,280
there is an intersex gene that trait is

761
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,880
in there somewhere

762
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,798
um we've done a lot of breeding with

763
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,039
them to try to wash that out and remove

764
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,879
it but it is always going to be present

765
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,798
it's going to pop up sometimes it can

766
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,400
happen from a lot of different things

767
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,519
um temperature swings early latent veg

768
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,759
early in flower

769
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,519
temperature swings temperature stress

770
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,480
too high or too low of one way

771
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,759
or the other can definitely uh what's

772
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
word influence

773
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,038
uh intersex traits in our plants uh

774
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,159
stress of any sort early in flower or

775
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,798
laden flower

776
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,760
can trigger intersex traits in our

777
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,798
plants

778
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,640
over feeding uh certain things can cause

779
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,839
intersex traits to appear within our

780
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
plants uh

781
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,199
light problems light leaks like

782
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
interruptions can cause

783
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
intersex traits within our plants now

784
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
let me interrupt myself i keep saying

785
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
can cause intersex traits within our

786
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,359
plants these traits

787
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,440
are already in the plant people say this

788
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,519
plant turned intersex on me and i always

789
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,600
say no it was always intersex

790
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,038
you just gave it the opportunity to show

791
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,959
you um

792
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,319
that plant was always an [ __ ] you

793
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,640
just gave it the option

794
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,158
to show you it was an [ __ ] it was

795
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,159
always an [ __ ] it always had that

796
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,240
intersex straight you just never gave it

797
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,159
the environment to express that

798
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,880
phenotypical expression

799
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
just like purple is a trait just like

800
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,400
trichomes

801
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,798
are a trait just like aroma is a trait

802
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
uh

803
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,278
just like the buzz is a trait of a plant

804
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,879
so is intersex that is a trait that is

805
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,798
carried within that plant

806
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,640
if you breed to that plant it will move

807
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,558
that trait along the breeding the

808
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
chances of getting it depend on

809
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,879
just the genetic mapping does this male

810
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,639
wash that out with this female or does

811
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,600
this female carry that trait how do we

812
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
breed it out

813
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,759
how do you miss it i wouldn't even mess

814
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,599
with it honestly as a breeder

815
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,119
with so many options and opportunities

816
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,079
for plants i don't mess with anything

817
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,479
that gives me

818
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,439
too much or much intersex trait i don't

819
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,000
mess with that

820
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
a lot of people have chosen to do that

821
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,759
so

822
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,278
um the trait is already there what is

823
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,359
happening is we are triggering that

824
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,400
trait to express itself in certain

825
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,879
environments

826
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,798
so sometimes the plants will show you

827
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
they have intersex traits early they'll

828
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,079
go right into flower and then you'll see

829
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,480
female parts and then you'll see male

830
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,639
parts like 15 days in that is an early

831
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,319
expressing intersex plant i would remove

832
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
that there's no need to keep that that

833
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,480
is an

834
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,320
early intersex that is going to be a

835
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
struggle for nine weeks

836
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,639
that is going to be a problem the entire

837
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,400
grow and the prob the main problem is

838
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
that male part and the female part are

839
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
timed up perfectly to where if pollen

840
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
does come out the females are timed

841
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,480
perfectly

842
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,240
to receive the pollen and there's no way

843
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,240
to keep that plant from pollinating

844
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,278
itself and the plants around it

845
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
so that early intersex sign i would not

846
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,480
even [ __ ] with that that one goes

847
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,039
bye-bye quite quickly

848
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,480
uh no no need for a struggle set

849
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,240
yourself up for success get that

850
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
problematic plant the [ __ ] out of there

851
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,679
replace it with something good or use

852
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,080
that space for one of the plants that's

853
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,840
in there just grow a little bit longer

854
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,359
let's talk about a week three intersex

855
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,199
plant now that's about that's about

856
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,278
where we are that's about day 15

857
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
uh day 17 day 20 you'll start seeing

858
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,319
those early intersex

859
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,679
plants right as things go into flower

860
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,038
get rid of that there's no reason to

861
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,400
keep that if you've got replacement

862
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,319
plants better seeds

863
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
other opportunities get rid of that

864
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,839
intersex plant don't breed with it don't

865
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,359
grow it don't waste your time

866
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,599
there's no need to have that in the

867
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,278
garden with all the options for good

868
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,678
seeds good plants

869
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,960
why why [ __ ] with it like that's like

870
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
going on a first date

871
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,079
and finding out that you're totally not

872
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
compatible and still trying to stick it

873
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,359
out for nine [ __ ] weeks let's not do

874
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,278
that to ourselves

875
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,119
call that [ __ ] intersex plant move

876
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,119
forward let's move later

877
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,319
let's talk about like week five or week

878
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,319
six

879
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,839
if i'm seeing intersex pop up around

880
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,079
week five or week six

881
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,439
i've got a decision to make is this

882
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,119
plant hot fire

883
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,720
is this something i've grown before is

884
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,399
this my first run with it

885
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,159
if it's my first run and i'm seeing

886
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,240
intersex at week five or six

887
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,880
this plant better have other traits that

888
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,599
make it highly desirable

889
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,559
is it throwing one or two nanners i may

890
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,439
keep her around

891
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,720
if she throws four or five five or six

892
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,919
i'm getting freaked out i'm getting

893
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
stressed out

894
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
i have to keep an eye on those nanners

895
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,759
and see

896
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,759
uh if they develop into if they start

897
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,440
making what looks like could open into a

898
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,000
sack i have to watch how big it's

899
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,080
getting

900
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,759
do i pluck them out do i cut those nugs

901
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,639
off the plant do i cut the plant down

902
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,640
entirely

903
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,720
that depends on other traits of the

904
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,320
plant how's the shape of the plant how's

905
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
the structure what's the leaf size

906
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,519
what's the aroma

907
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,199
what does it look like overall other

908
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,679
than those couple of nanners in the

909
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,480
plant

910
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
if there are enough there five six seven

911
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,440
i'm gonna get worried it's gonna bother

912
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,119
me i won't be able to sleep at night

913
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,360
every time i close my eyes i'm gonna go

914
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,359
my crop's getting seeded by an intersex

915
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,479
plant that i'm too stubborn to remove

916
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,000
then i'm gonna have to wake up and

917
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,519
[ __ ] get rid of it if it's got like

918
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
nine [ __ ] nanners on it

919
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,798
if it's got two or three we may keep an

920
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,360
eye on it and see what it does

921
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,398
we're gonna watch those nanners they may

922
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,038
be sterile

923
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,319
they may never do anything they may be

924
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,240
filled with pollen

925
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,079
it's my job to keep an eye on it and see

926
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,359
what they do and make a decision

927
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,038
if they're gonna fill with pollen and

928
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,439
cause me a problem i'm gonna get rid of

929
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,839
them

930
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,278
if those are sterile nanners let it grow

931
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,240
let it grow let it grow there's no

932
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,839
reason to cut down

933
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,519
sterile manners they're not gonna do

934
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,599
anything they're ugly

935
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,759
there is a slight herm trait within that

936
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,079
plant maybe not breed with it

937
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,839
keep an eye on it uh see if certain

938
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,199
things are triggering those nanners but

939
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,959
if they just pop up

940
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
regularly i've worked with a couple of

941
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,399
plants that like at week eight it'll

942
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
just pop a couple of nanners

943
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,719
so let's move right into that ah later

944
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,039
later in flower popping nanners

945
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,759
week eight week nine i'm not concerned

946
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,839
really

947
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,599
because my plants are nine weeks into

948
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,439
flower eight weeks into flower

949
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,199
the pistols on the plants the parts that

950
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,120
would receive the pollen are withered

951
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
and dry and dusty they're not gonna get

952
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,918
any pollen at this point they will not

953
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
pollinate my plants

954
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
all right so if we're getting manners

955
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,918
around week eight or week nine i don't

956
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,519
worry too much

957
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,919
because those plants are too far into

958
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,679
their life cycle to become pollinated

959
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,759
the thing i am concerned with is if i'm

960
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,798
running a perpetual grow which i often

961
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,240
do

962
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,720
which would mean that i've got plants

963
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
coming in as plants are going out

964
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,000
so i may have some plants right at peak

965
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,600
pollination time

966
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,159
while these plants at week eight or week

967
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,359
nine possibly are producing manners

968
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,679
which may contain

969
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,798
pollen now we got a couple things to

970
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,559
think about

971
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,918
do we pick out those nanners do we chop

972
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,359
off the buds with the nanners it's

973
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,120
usually the top so do you want to do

974
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,798
that

975
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,959
are those nanners going to produce

976
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,759
pollen or are they sterile

977
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,038
most of the time in my experience a

978
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,558
plant that expresses an

979
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:26,079
intersex trait around week 8 or week 9

980
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,918
generally produces sterile flowers they

981
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,639
do not have any pollen in them they do

982
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,399
not create

983
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,679
any pollination they don't cause any

984
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,839
problems

985
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,880
that is most of my experience i have

986
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,199
seen the opposite

987
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
but probably ninety percent of the time

988
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
those late

989
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,199
flower intersex male flowers are not

990
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,839
threatening to my crop

991
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,440
those are uh let's talk about a previous

992
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,839
episode those are

993
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,880
the plant trying to find a way to

994
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,519
survive

995
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,760
sometimes those plants may pollinate but

996
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,319
most of the time those nanos that pop up

997
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,319
late

998
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,158
do not contain any pollen so they

999
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,359
usually do not stress me

1000
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,278
again if there are one or two two or

1001
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,199
three once we get up to like five or

1002
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,079
seven again i start going what is with

1003
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
that plan

1004
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,839
and it's already done we're at week

1005
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,079
eight or week nine i'll let it finish up

1006
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,000
i may grow it one more time and maybe

1007
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,359
not push it so hard at the end or maybe

1008
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,798
push it harder at the end

1009
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,879
usually i push the plants pretty [ __ ]

1010
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,200
hard that is probably what caused it

1011
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,600
to show me intersex traits so during the

1012
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,038
next grow i would simply reduce my feed

1013
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,480
be a little bit more careful with my

1014
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,119
light cycle pay a little bit more

1015
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,278
attention

1016
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,239
and see if i can make that plant not

1017
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,839
show me intersex

1018
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,079
traits on the second run if it does it

1019
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,359
again i've got a decision to make am i

1020
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,240
going to get rid of it is it worth

1021
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,119
keeping it

1022
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,759
so that is a late flowering plant it's

1023
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,839
doing that

1024
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,599
in late flower because it wants to

1025
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,839
survive it's doing what we were calling

1026
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,119
the jurassic park effect in a previous

1027
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,439
episode

1028
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,398
these plants have the will to survive

1029
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,120
life does find

1030
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,678
a way so that is why they're showing you

1031
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,119
intersex in week 9 or week 10 some later

1032
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,200
flowering plants will do it if you've

1033
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,199
got a 10 or 11 12 week flowering plant

1034
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,278
it may do it in the last two weeks

1035
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,480
right before harvest time naturally in

1036
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,480
the environment

1037
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
that plant would have been destroyed by

1038
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,839
something a goat would have eaten it

1039
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,360
something the wind would have taken it

1040
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,038
down nature would have knocked it over

1041
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,240
the wind the weather the rain

1042
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,440
something would have knocked it down it

1043
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,120
never would have gotten that far in

1044
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,558
nature and if it did it would have said

1045
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,239
i don't know what to do why didn't i get

1046
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,200
pollinated yet because like i've spoken

1047
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,079
about before

1048
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,278
these plants main goal is to reproduce

1049
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,879
they want to survive

1050
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,398
so there can be more plants for next

1051
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,278
year and if we don't give them the

1052
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,439
opportunity

1053
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,359
to mate they'll find a way in that plant

1054
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,880
just goes hey you didn't pollinate me

1055
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,398
i've been putting all of my energy into

1056
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,159
making babies you never gave me that

1057
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,518
opportunity i'm gonna figure it out

1058
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,360
and there's something in these plants

1059
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,278
that says i can make my own male parts

1060
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,278
and just start spitting out flowers

1061
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,278
we have selected hopefully through

1062
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,960
breeding through selective breeding

1063
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,880
through several generations hopefully

1064
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,120
we've removed most of those intersex

1065
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
traits but it is still there it's still

1066
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,319
an opportunity it's going to pop

1067
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,159
up it's not removed from the cannabis

1068
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,439
gene pool by any means

1069
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,760
it's all about selection so i went on a

1070
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,440
really good ramble there but

1071
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,158
uh early uh showing intersex plants they

1072
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,159
go

1073
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,080
mid flower like week five or week six

1074
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,159
you've got some things to think about

1075
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,000
late flowering plants that show intersex

1076
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,440
traits if they're fire

1077
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,278
keep them around let them have a couple

1078
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
of nanners at the end you probably won't

1079
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,038
cause any problems

1080
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,960
and if they do pollinate uh use those

1081
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,960
seeds grow them yourself you've got some

1082
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,558
really cool bag seeds don't share them

1083
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,079
with your friends don't make any money

1084
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,158
off of them but grow them because you

1085
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,759
may have some really cool [ __ ]

1086
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,679
if that plant was cool enough to keep

1087
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,278
around until week nine or week ten even

1088
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,240
though it made some intersex flowers

1089
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,640
it's probably good

1090
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,440
smoke maybe whatever you accidentally

1091
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,159
bred that to

1092
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,519
is going to be better or equally good

1093
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
smoke with different traits either way

1094
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
it's a fun project you've got some free

1095
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,359
bag seeds to work with if you're a new

1096
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,480
grower you're new at germinating seeds

1097
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,079
there's some seeds you could try to

1098
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,880
germinate they were free

1099
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,480
practice seeds are never a bad thing so

1100
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
let me make sure i answered

1101
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,079
uh the majority of your question here

1102
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,558
because i do feel like i got rambly

1103
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,199
uh do an episode or segment on nanners

1104
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:08,879
um

1105
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,640
i like to use the word intersex we're

1106
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
going to avoid the h word

1107
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,240
i definitely don't like the shortened

1108
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,278
version of the h word

1109
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,079
um that just sounds childish to me when

1110
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,558
you say it

1111
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,759
uh h and then e at the end of it h e it

1112
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,720
just sounds like a

1113
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,839
third grade word uh just say just herman

1114
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,079
or something like that if you're going

1115
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,319
to

1116
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,199
do it say short for herman don't say

1117
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,000
harmony

1118
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
we're just going to end up with a

1119
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,519
youtube [ __ ] strike here intersex is

1120
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,678
the word we want to use guys

1121
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,120
intersex is the appropriate word for

1122
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,080
what we're talking about

1123
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,678
um do a show on intersex yes week three

1124
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,119
cut it week five or six you got

1125
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,640
decisions to make

1126
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:49,599
late flowering uh late showing intersex

1127
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,120
they're probably sterile probably not

1128
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,000
too big of a deal unless maybe you've

1129
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,479
got a perpetual

1130
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,919
and maybe that's not a sterile ah male

1131
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,720
flower popping up

1132
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,640
most of the time intersex is from uh it

1133
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,360
is in there it's not something that you

1134
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,960
did it is

1135
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,719
in there and then it just expressed

1136
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,240
itself it's just a trait that was always

1137
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,240
in the plant waiting to show you had to

1138
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,320
trigger it give it the right environment

1139
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,759
and a lot of that is just from breeding

1140
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,399
selection we have to choose better

1141
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,079
plants

1142
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,480
uh stress test the plants before you

1143
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,760
breed with them test the progeny before

1144
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
you sell them

1145
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,280
that is my short ramble on intersex

1146
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,960
plants you guys um

1147
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
i think i covered a lot of ground in

1148
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,918
this episode i want to thank everybody

1149
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,598
again for listening to episode 660 of

1150
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
the grow from your heart podcast

1151
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,879
when i say the numbers at the start of

1152
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,158
the show it puts a big smile on my face

1153
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,519
and it blows my mind

1154
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,440
every time 660 episodes and many of you
