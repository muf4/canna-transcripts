all right i do have some real topics

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
here that we want to get into i have

127
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,319
been doing i don't talk about it a lot

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
because

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,399
i try to keep some projects secret until

130
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,918
i see a little bit of success i feel

131
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,079
like if i talk about things a little bit

132
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,439
too early it gives me the opportunity to

133
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,240
fail and then i've got to talk about

134
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,680
failures which is never fun but maybe i

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
should mention even though i'm a

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
professional grower that has done a lot

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,439
of [Â __Â ] sometimes i still fail and it's

138
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,000
okay to [Â __Â ] up and fail let it humble

139
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,839
you but let's get myself back on track i

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,079
am talking about an outdoor garden that

141
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,478
i've been playing in i did some outdoor

142
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,758
breeding i had some help it was not just

143
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,279
me i don't want to take all of the

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
credit big shout out to the team that

145
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,879
worked outdoors this year they know who

146
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,719
they are they may not want their name

147
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,159
set here on the show at this time we'll

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
talk about them and introduce them in

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080
the future if they want that but uh big

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
shout out thank you for the help and for

151
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,359
the work and for the space but we've got

152
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,960
some outdoor space going it's actually a

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,439
beautiful greenhouse

154
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,439
i took a few plants to the greenhouse

155
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,439
and i may have taken king solomon out

156
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
there and he may have done some work

157
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,759
that's right i did some outdoor breeding

158
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,079
or some greenhouse breeding and

159
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,319
something i learned that those seeds

160
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,038
developed quickly outdoor breeding

161
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,279
happens really fast i was not expecting

162
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,519
it um it's a good thing the seeds will

163
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,359
be done earlier than anticipated the

164
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,599
pollination happened much earlier than

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
anticipated and i learned a lot this

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
year and i'm very excited to have added

167
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,639
outdoor breeding to my list of skills

168
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,038
that i feel comfortable doing uh this

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
year was our inaugural run but i had a

170
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,000
good uh support team i had friends that

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,400
i could message and say hey bro i'm

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
gonna breed outside any advice big shout

173
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,839
out to jesse he sent me a paragraph of

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
uh oddly spelled uh weirdly punctuated

175
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,719
[Â __Â ] and taught me how to grow outdoors

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
and breed outdoors jesse i'm just

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
picking on your brother nothing but love

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,478
he can build a house you guys

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,759
but jesse gave me some great advice and

180
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,318
with uh jesse's advice my lead and our

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
crew's hard work and effort uh we have

182
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
got some seeds that will be ready here

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
uh hopefully they'll be done by they'll

184
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
be dying i'm gonna give myself a

185
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,119
deadline but around the halloween time

186
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
we'll be cleaning up seeds making

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,519
packages getting that stuff ready for

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
possibly the endo expo i did mention

189
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,879
that the endo expo

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
is kind of up in the air at this point

191
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,439
it's been a week since i've recorded and

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,280
i have not oh excuse me for that

193
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,038
it has been a week since i recorded and

194
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
i have not received any updates on the

195
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,800
endo expo once again as soon as i do

196
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
receive an update on that i will let you

197
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
know but there will be a bunch of fresh

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,439
seeds and new crosses that you've never

199
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,879
heard of stuff i've never talked about

200
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,879
will be available that came out of this

201
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,000
greenhouse okay i feel like i'm rambling

202
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,918
because i'm very excited about the

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,439
greenhouse my point was that things are

204
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,079
happening much more quickly in the

205
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,759
greenhouse the buds uh it looked like i

206
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,038
said oh this is where the buds are i was

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
teaching somebody new i said these are

208
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,519
where the buds are going to happen this

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
is how it's going to go the next day i

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,959
was like well there are all the buds

211
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,799
holy [Â __Â ] and then i showed them this is

212
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,638
where we pollinated here's the start of

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
buds and the next day i was like holy

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,680
[Â __Â ] they're all the seeds it went

215
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,198
really quickly outdoors i was amazed i'm

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,038
excited for next year i'm already

217
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,879
planning for the next year's outdoor

218
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,959
breeding program got ideas and things i

219
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,038
want to do i get in over my head

220
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,959
sometimes all right let's focus now on

221
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,639
some of these patreon questions i do

222
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,198
have a couple of patreon questions that

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
came from the patreon audience obviously

224
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
the first patreon question in this

225
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,198
episode comes from our friend zachary u

226
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,719
it is a good outdoor growing question i

227
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,759
feel like it's very applicable at this

228
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,759
time of year and it goes a lot like this

229
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,759
i have eight plants four of them are the

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,919
same strains started at the same time

231
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,479
that makes sense then there are two

232
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,878
pairs of different strains started at

233
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,918
the same time one pair being scarlet

234
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,000
begonias and another pair uh it doesn't

235
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,918
say what the others are then it says

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
five plants that consist of three ogs

237
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,839
one scarlet begonia wow it's a sweet

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
cherry pie are in one area that is

239
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,399
pretty heavy with sunlight consistently

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
they are behind the other three at

241
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,158
another spot in regards to flowering

242
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
speed but the three of the same strain

243
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,240
and the same area are flowering at

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
different rates can this be summed up to

245
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,440
being simple as different phenotypes or

246
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,839
something i cannot even think of so the

247
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,760
question here is he's got several plants

248
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
and they're acting different outdoors

249
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,639
he's got some in one area and some in

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,039
another area the plants in the same area

251
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,559
are showing different expressions

252
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,319
they're the same strain they all came

253
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
from the same package of seeds but

254
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
they're showing different stuff yes my

255
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,278
friend that is a perfect example of

256
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,679
phenotypical expression

257
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,120
just think about it if uh somebody had

258
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,120
let's talk about two parents i'm gonna

259
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,799
pick anybody's parents maybe yours maybe

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
not if you don't want it to be let's

261
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,639
talk about two parents two breeding

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
parents they made three babies let's

263
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,799
talk about a family with three kids you

264
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,200
may have one tall skinny kid that would

265
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,120
be me you may have one short chunkier

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,440
kid that might not be me then you may

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
have one that is kind of weirdly shaped

268
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,760
in the middle one kid may be really

269
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,759
athletic one kid may not be athletic at

270
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,919
all one may be really aggressive one may

271
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,759
be really passive but you came from the

272
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,120
same parents and you grew up in the same

273
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,919
exact environment those are just

274
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
phenotypical expressions the plants do

275
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,000
very similar things so you're going to

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
see that variation that expression in

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
the plants i would be very interesting

278
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
on a totally different experiment to

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,959
take clones and put a clone of the same

280
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,440
plant in your two different grow

281
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,278
locations and see what they do there so

282
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
what i definitely think is happening is

283
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,000
that you are seeing phenotypical

284
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,838
variation if you've got a pack of seeds

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,559
and you put you've got four of the same

286
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,640
plant in one area they look different i

287
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,000
do believe that it's just phenotypical

288
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,159
variation i'm going to read the question

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
here make sure i answer that correctly

290
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,958
so there is another part that i do want

291
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
to touch on you said that they are

292
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,199
behind in flowering uh compared to

293
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,839
plants the same type of plants in

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,839
another area uh that is another part of

295
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,440
phenotypical expression maybe that one

296
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
area is getting more light maybe it's

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
getting less light

298
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,639
longer light maybe something is blocking

299
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,078
the light maybe it's shaded

300
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,600
maybe the temperature is just a little

301
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,599
bit different over there maybe the soil

302
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,839
is a little bit different but that shows

303
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,159
us how just a little bit of difference

304
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,920
in environment can change the plants

305
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,519
drastically they're further behind each

306
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,838
other or further ahead each other in

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,679
flower just because of the environment

308
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,839
in which they are in that is a very good

309
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,799
example so most of what you are seeing

310
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,880
here is phenotypical expression i guess

311
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,039
all of it is phenotypical expression

312
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,879
even if it is the environment making it

313
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,879
happen because that's what phenotypical

314
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,519
expression is it's showing different

315
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,439
traits based on your environment

316
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,759
expressing different things so that's

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
what you've got going on there uh good

318
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,159
uh good foresight good prediction good

319
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,039
hypothesis and i do agree with you buddy

320
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,719
that is just basic phenotypical

321
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,879
expression big shout out to my buddy

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,720
zachary you for the great message uh

323
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,039
keep them growing bro and since you said

324
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,360
you've got some irie genetics outdoors

325
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,278
where are my photos bro pictures or it

326
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
didn't happen if you guys are growing i

327
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,639

says hey rasta jeff i've been loving the

389
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
breeding talk you've been doing lately

390
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,000
thank you bro i like talking about

391
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,480
breeding if you have specific breeding

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
questions please do send them i like

393
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
specific questions it gets me more

394
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
focused on my rambles because i do get

395
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
rambly if you haven't noticed on this

396
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
episode it goes on to say my mind was

397
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,919
wandering dear during your latest

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
episode thanks bro mine probably was too

399
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,559
says i thought of a couple related

400
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,360
questions when you breed how often do

401
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,838
you re-test your seeds that is a very

402
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,240
good question being a person who breeds

403
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
uh for commercial purposes my seeds are

404
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,320
on the market through several different

405
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,800
avenues it is a good idea that i do keep

406
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,160
up my quality control standards uh so

407
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
that is a very good question i do

408
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,319
appreciate you uh checking me on that a

409
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
lot of people go unchecked and they

410
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
forget to check so thank you for

411
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,920
checking on me

412
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,000
so it goes on it says if you make a

413
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,639
thousand seeds and that batch passes the

414
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,078
test do you retest the next time you

415
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,079
make a batch

416
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,679
so we'll make a lot of seeds we'll make

417
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,759
a thousand seeds we'll test them you

418
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,439
guys get to see you guys get to see most

419
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,679
of the testing i try to keep it fairly

420
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,360
transparent i have a lot of testers who

421
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,439
are on social media but i also have

422
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,480
testers who are not on social media you

423
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,800
see the folks who are uh you see zozo j

425
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,519

426
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,919
[Â __Â ] time lapse video uh who else

427
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,159

mobius grows does a great job they post

430
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,360
all that stuff to social media big shout

431
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,559
out to all the testers who i didn't

432
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,000
mention that was enough sorry i don't

433
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,198
want the list to just keep going it's

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
not an award show we're not going to

435
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,120
shout out everybody in the gang but all

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,879
the testers post their stuff up on

437
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
social media and you guys get to see it

438
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,039
so you get to see that initial testing

439
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,559
how does it look like is the structure

440
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,000
good what are the leaf shape like what

441
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,159
is the bud shaped like are there any

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
cool colors a lot of times we see if

443
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,198
there are any problems through those

444
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
testers they'll show us were there any

445
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,359
issues luckily most of the time there

446
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,439
are no issues but like all things [Â __Â ]

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,278
does happen so get a lot of testers

448
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,720
going they send me test reports then we

449
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,439
decide if we want to release it we

450
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,440
release it then right before it's sold

451
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
out or sometimes unfortunately just

452
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,079
after it sells out i decide i need to

453
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,600
make more and restock that strain so

454
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,000
here's where your question really comes

455
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
into play do i test this next batch i'll

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,799
do the pollen chucking i'll make the

457
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,879
male plant in the female plant do their

458
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,919
magic i'll get the seeds out of there i

459
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,078
generally will do a solid germination

460
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,439
test i get uh i don't even know how many

461
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,758
seeds fit in the palm of my hand it's

462
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,759
probably about 40 or 50 seeds and i just

463
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
do the paper towel germination test fold

464
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
up a paper towel a lot like i do this

465
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,559
piece of paper

466
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,759
fold it up soak it with water throw the

467
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,679
seeds right in the middle there leave

468
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,199
them on the table they don't get any

469
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,039
special treatment but i do make sure

470
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,359
they're wet i do check on them every few

471
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,120
hours then i open it up to see how many

472
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,278
of those seeds germinated that is one of

473
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
my main concerns at this point if they

474
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,039
are germinating there are healthy seeds

475
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,799
they've went they flowered long enough

476
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,240
they finished most of the time i could

477
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,599
tell that by squeezing them i push them

478
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
on the table they're hard if it hurts my

479
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
finger it makes a dent the seeds are

480
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,439
ready um so i germinate them i make sure

481
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,759
they sprout if they're sprouting i'm

482
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,360
mostly confident in them then we'll send

483
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
a few of those out as freebies to the

484
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
friends and they'll grow them and

485
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,359
they'll know what they've got to be like

486
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
hey run these real quick and they'll

487
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,039
just run them and we can see what

488
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,480
they've got i don't really do honestly

489
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,480
rigorous vigorous retesting as long as

490
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
those mother plants and father plant

491
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,039
weren't ruined destroyed uh compromised

492
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,879
as the word i'm seeking in my head as

493
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,319
long as there was no compromisation of

494
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,399
the parent plants i feel like the

495
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
genetics are exactly the same the

496
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,078
breeding will happen exactly the same

497
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,639
the phenotypes are going to be the same

498
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,558
i didn't put any other there's no other

499
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
ingredients in my recipe so there should

500
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,439
not be any variation again if my parent

501
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
plants will remain

502
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,600
remain uncompromised if there was no

503
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,918
compromised health no stress

504
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,240
no light weirdness no nutrient problems

505
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
anything like that then it should be the

506
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
same there's no scientific biological

507
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,960
reason why i would get variation

508
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
maybe some epigenetics or something like

509
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
that may cost something but i think it

510
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
would take much longer than what i'm

511
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,798
able to do with these plants i haven't

512
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,120
had them for hundreds of years so um i

513
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:42,639
don't do rigorous vigorous retesting of

514
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,639
the crosses too deeply i do retest for

515
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
germination rates i test every batch of

516
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
seeds for germ rates we want to know

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,759
that every batch of seeds is good so if

518
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
i make a batch there's a thousand seeds

519
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,079
in there 50 to 100 of them just go

520
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,360
strictly just to germination

521
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,079
we'll pull a few of those out if we've

522
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,199
got room to keep them and grow those

523
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,519
most of the time that's how it works you

524
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
germ like 50 of them i pick [Â __Â ] 25

525
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,200
of them grow those uh find 10 or 12

526
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,798
females in there take pictures all those

527
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,960
have good documentation that's how it

528
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,759
usually goes but the second time around

529
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,840
i don't really do vigorous testing i

530
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,038
send them out to the crew i say hey

531
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,480
rosin man hey mobius hey somebody uh

532
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,160
these are a remake can you give me a

533
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,480
quick run or i grow them myself i'll

534
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
just grow a few and i can tell quickly

535
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,919
uh they're my kids i could tell quite

536
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
quickly if they're gonna be worth a [Â __Â ]

537
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
or not

538
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,959
then it wraps up with not looking to

539
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,879
have you do a quality control test on

540
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,480
the air just more wondering how

541
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,000
different breeding is between the same

542
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,160
cuts over time and years

543
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,240
in my experience i have not noticed any

544
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,400
change in the breeding i'm pretty good

545
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,279
at identifying uh the offspring the

546
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,480
phenotypes from my crosses and i don't

547
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,599
see any difference any uh any shift any

548
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,519
degradation any weird evolution in my

549
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,639
breeding i think it all looks just the

550
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,319
same

551
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
um i think i'd have to have the plants

552
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,359
for quite a bit longer i think i'd have

553
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,918
to be doing it for quite a bit longer

554
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,279
for the plants to build up any memory uh

555
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,280
unless i started breeding with sick

556
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,879
plants or something which at that point

557
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,160
i don't do if the plants don't sustain

558
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
health if i can't keep them healthy

559
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,679
there's no need for them to stay in the

560
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,599
garden because i can keep a plant basic

561
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
health is [Â __Â ] i'm really good at

562
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,798
that they look green and healthy all the

563
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
time so yeah if they're not staying

564
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,079
green and migrate they go bye-bye

565
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
because they're pain in the ass i think

566
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,839
i wrapped up your question let me give

567
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,960
it a quick skim there's not a lot to it

568
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,439
uh how often do you retest uh strict

569
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,480
germination testing uh strict first

570
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,798
level testing second batch not serious

571
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,120
on the the re-testing that much but i do

572
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,879
do germ tests i think that covers it all

573
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,719
before i wrap up this message i do have

574
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
one cool topic i can talk about pretty

575
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,798
soon i'm going to do some different

576
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,038
testing i just mentioned it a minute ago

577
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,279
that i'm doing some breeding outdoors i

578
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,079
have made some of the same crosses

579
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,240
outdoors that i've made indoors and i

580
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,079
have not ever tested the outdoor grow

581
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
yet so i don't know what the outdoor

582
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,079
progeny is going to look like i need a

583
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,480
couple of friends a couple of testers

584
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,558
that will run a batch of seeds made

585
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,480
indoors and a batch of seeds made

586
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,319
outdoors i think i said that correctly

587
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,880
take the indoor seeds and outdoor seeds

588
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,960
label them correctly like plant a

589
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
indoors plant b outdoors and run them

590
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,558
all next to each other and see if there

591
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,079
is any difference in there i want to run

592
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,319
a bunch i want some friends to run a

593
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,798
bunch uh the experiments are fun when i

594
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,759
do them but i need more feedback as well

595
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,519
i'm going to see stuff but uh under the

596
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,960
whichever lights i choose to use in the

597
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,639
summertime i use one kind of light in

598
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,480
the winter i use another how do they

599
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,240
respond under my lights but also how do

600
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,720
they react in your grow and in dave's

601
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,279
grow and in john's grow and in jacks

602
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,558
grow and jill's grow and bills grow and

603
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,200
everybody's growing i want to see what

604
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,519
they do so pretty soon we're going to

605
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
get to test stuff that was made indoors

606
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,798
right next to stuff that was made

607
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
outdoors because i recently bred some of

608
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,359
the same stuff uh some of it's coming

609
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,038
down from the indoor grow and it's

610
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,959
almost ready in the outdoor grow just

611
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,480
ironically did the same stuff at the

612
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
same time and we'll get to test those

613
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,319
side by side that is something i'm very

614
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,558
curious about new testing that will get

615
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,319
to be done so that was a good rant that

616
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,240
was a good side subject to get me going

617
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,319
on i do appreciate that i'm really

618
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,480
excited about the outdoor greenhouse

619
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,399
grow this year and i super cannot wait

620
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,798
to grow the seeds that come from that

621
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
and see are they more vigorous are they

622
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,798
any different is there any difference at

623
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,558
all i just know that we made a lot more

624
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,720
seeds outdoors than we would have

625
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,798
indoors so that was the super cool part

626
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,400
and it seemed to happen super quickly

627
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,400
all right i am off on a good ramble

628
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,880
again let's reel me back in and get back

629
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
on a podcast my buddy rastabot dude

630
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
thank you for a great patreon message

631
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,558
thank you once again for all of the

632
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,919
discord work cannot wait to hang out

633
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,839
with you on discord when i get done

634
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,520
recording here it does take quite a few

635
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,319
minutes to load all the files from the

636
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,000
computer onto the drive as that happens

637
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,759
i go take a couple of dabs and hang out

638
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
with the crew on discord hope you're

639
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,599

i'm going to wrap up this podcast now

646
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,799
this will be a quick thursday episode i

647

want to thank you i don't even know what

649
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,760

of the glitches on all of the audio

689
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,278
feeds but i do my best to make sure that

because honestly i edit down the youtube

697
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,959
video then i pull the audio out of that

698
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,879
so i've got to do the video first so it

699
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,840
gets up there on youtube then while it's

700
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
