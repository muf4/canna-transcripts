at dank seed dot store you guys know I

35
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,880
like to start these episodes off by

36
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:15,978
letting you know what I'm smoking on

37
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,798
today I've been taking dabs of this soul

38
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:20,388
cleanser full-spectrum extract from our

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,969
friends at Green Dot labs at his cush

40
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:24,888
cleaner and chem for together and they

41
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:28,248
describe it as a lemon-lime sport drink

42
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:30,560
when Dex and chem dog gas flavors you

43
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:33,078
know the lemon-lime sport drink was very

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,939
very dominant in the flavor then when

45
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,949
you exhale there's a hint of that Windex

46
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:39,019
and I know that sounds crazy but it

47
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,389
tasted and had a little aroma of Windex

48
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:43,670
and then the after flavor is definitely

49
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:46,248
that chem dog gas with a little bit of

50
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,618
the lemon-lime sport drink just chilling

51
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:50,449
there so very well described that's the

52
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:53,388
sole cleanser from our friends at Green

53
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,639
Dot labs also after that I took a big

54
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:57,289
dab of some cherry diesel live resin and

55
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:59,328
that seemed to put me in a really

56
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:01,700
rambley talkative mood that cherry

57
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:03,528
diesel was super smooth it had a candy

58
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,749
flavor to it and really made my head

59
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:07,759
spin so the combo has got me nice and

60
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,799
talkative this should be a great podcast

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,509
all right before we move forward into

62
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,400
the main topic of the podcast I would

63
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:14,799
like to read a couple of emails this

64
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,230
first email comes from

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,660
who calls himself Marco s cuando las and

66
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,939
the email goes like this hi raasta Jeff

67
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,859
thank you for your great show it pains

68
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,409
me to hear you recommend Hobby Lobby as

69
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,880
a place to buy supplies Hobby Lobby is a

70
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,349
politically active right-wing

71
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,719
organization lobbying for the

72
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,489
continuation of the war on drugs you're

73
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,109
giving your money to a corporation who

74
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,030
would like to see you your friends and

75
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,130
your family rotting in jail for the rest

76
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,629
of your lives

77
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,159
now what this email is referring to is

78
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,199
in the trimming episode I mentioned

79
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,139
picking up your scissors at Hobby Lobby

80
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,489
um this guy is correct we should not be

81
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,989
shopping at Hobby Lobby thanks for

82
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,030
waking me up to that the reason I said

83
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,610
Hobby Lobby is because not everybody has

84
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,439
access to a gross store not everybody

85
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,620
can just drive right up to grow

86
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,020
generation or one loved garden supply or

87
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,250
a grow warehouse or way to grow not

88
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,080
everybody could just zip right over

89
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,419
there and shop around and get the best

90
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,100
deal on scissors I blurted out Hobby

91
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,719
Lobby because that was my back-up plan

92
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,659
when I didn't have a gross store around

93
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,439
here those places have a Hobby Lobby

94
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,449
also some people aren't comfortable

95
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,189
going to the gross store they can't be

96
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:19,899
seen at the hydroponic store they can't

97
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:21,909
be seen parked out front there they

98
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,439
can't be seen in there they just have to

99
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,270
be a little more careful they can go to

100
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,159
Hobby Lobby they might be going to Hobby

101
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,480
Lobby already they can just cruise over

102
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,129
and pick up a pair of those scissors but

103
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,019
you are correct we should not be

104
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,180
shopping at Hobby Lobby if they are

105
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,070
continuing to participate and support

106
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,180
the war on drugs we don't want anything

107
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,489
to do with that so let's stop giving

108
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,080
them our money here's what I like about

109
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,420
this email our friend Marco s windowless

110
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,070
offers suggestions and other

111
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,349
opportunities he presents a problem

112
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,000
offers a suggestion on how to solve that

113
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,799
problem he says instead I suggest

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,020
sending your listeners to either their

115
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,330
local grow shop or a shop that supports

116
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,550
our community like build a soil then he

117
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,100
adds I just got titanium bladed scissors

118
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,800
for eight dollars and 40 cents on sale

119
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,419
at bil the soil so you guys that is a

120
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,980
great option let's try to skip Hobby

121
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,238
Lobby if we can I should not have said

122
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,310
that I should not have recommended that

123
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,930
let's skip the Hobby Lobby let's try to

124
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,629
go somewhere that supports our community

125
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,580
better first off let's try to shop at a

126
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,189
local grocer that supports our community

127
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,139
if you cannot do that then maybe find a

128
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,639
craft store that is locally owned

129
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,349
maybe you got a craft store owned by a

130
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,449
little old lady and her daughter runs it

131
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,919
maybe give them your money but try to

132
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,069
put your money back into your community

133
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,930
and not somewhere

134
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,120
is going to support the war on drugs if

135
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,829
all else fails that's when you go to

136
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,509
Amazon our friend sent us another email

137
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,550
saying that it's probably cheaper to

138
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,649
shop at the gross store which yes that

139
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,360
is probably true but not everybody has a

140
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,489
gross store and not everybody can go to

141
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,569
the gross store so some folks are gonna

142
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,800
need a back-up plan

143
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,019
some folks are gonna need a way to get

144
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,569
their supplies discretely if you can't

145
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,549
go to your local grocery store that

146
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,250
supports your community locally that's

147
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,750
when you turn to Amazon but if the

148
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,339
products are available locally and

149
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,379
they're competitively priced and you

150
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,839
don't put yourself in any jeopardy by

151
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,430
going to a gross store please shop at

152
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,619
your local grocer or that supports our

153
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,300
community if you've got a chain store or

154
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,009
you've got a mom-and-pop store try to

155
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,930
support that mom-and-pop store let's try

156
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,909
to spend our money wisely let's try to

157
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,250
support people instead of businesses so

158
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,540

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,290
the podcast this email goes like this it

168
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,419
says Rasta Jeff thank you for your

169
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,920
podcast I am new to the industry I've

170
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,530
worked for the Department of Defense for

171
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,080
14 years now I was against all things

172
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:47,119
cannabis until recently I really just

173
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,149
want to say thank you I listen to your

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
podcast and the DGC podcast and you all

175
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,589
have turned me on to cannabis as

176
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,870
medicine and I wholeheartedly believe in

177
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,849
it Wow here's the part where I wish I

178
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,189
had some sort of audience applause sound

179
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,780
effects to insert because that is great

180
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:04,610
this person worked for the Department of

181
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,729
Defense for 14 years and they were

182
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,230
against all things cannabis but with the

183
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,939
help of the dude grows crew and myself

184
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,850
we were able to convince this person

185
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,759
that cannabis is medicine and now they

186
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,590
wholeheartedly believe in cannabis as

187
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,209
medicine so we have flipped this person

188
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,009
they agree with us now let's continue

189
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:24,199
with the email it says I am currently

190
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,870
looking to get away from the enemy and

191
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,750
they save the government Babylon and

192
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,519
into the medical cannabis industry now

193
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,620
that it's legal in Oklahoma I hope to

194
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,990
make a life of helping people heal and

195
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,000
feel better about life and themselves I

196
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,490
use and have used for about a year now

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,079
as my health is not what it once was I

198
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,658
have seen my dad pass away

199
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,240
from cancer due to Agent Orange and I

200
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:49,038
wish he had access to cannabis my mother

201
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,079
is currently battling breast cancer and

202
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,449
has used cannabis to keep her weight up

203
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,399
as well as myself battling melanoma and

204
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,919

relief thank you for giving me good

206
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,370

207
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:04,069

208

209
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,870

222
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:42,468

topic I've got one more thing I'd like

331
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,370
to remind you about and that one thing

332
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,290
is patreon if you feel like this podcast

333
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,789
was educational entertaining or

334
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,399
informative and you'd like to contribute

335
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:17,939
financially to the show you can do so by

slash grow from your heart all of the

338
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,899
information that you need will be right

339
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,059
there

340
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,970
you guys I offer several different gifts

341
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,958
or rewards for my patreon contributors

342
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,759
that's the quickest way to get your

343
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,019
email read on a show or the quickest way

344
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,958
to get a shout-out from me

345
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:37,179
but I also offer things like a 30-minute

346
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,159
one-on-one consultation through FaceTime

347
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,989
or Skype we can look at your grow room

348
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,639
you can bring your plant right up to the

349
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,959
camera you can show me what's going on

350
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,120
with your plants and we can diagnose a

351
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,319
problem if you've got a problem or we

352
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,459
can walk through your grow room if

353
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,720
you've got your phone and we could just

354
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,859
look at your grow and figure out what's

355
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,959
going on we can figure out how to

356
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,459
improve your grow or if you've got any

357
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,049
weird growing questions that you don't

358
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,669
feel like you can we can answer through

359
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,708
emails or whatever you can get personal

360
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,929
consultations the way to do that is

361
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:04,500
through the patreon campaign and the way

362
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:14,259
to find the patreon page is

363
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:16,870
www.patiyer.com I seed and feminized

364
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,639
seed labeling if you guys pay attention

365
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,649
to the show or if you pay attention to I

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,610
read genetics you know that I am making

367
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,980
golden

368
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,039
feminized seeds and more lemon Jeffrey

369
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,870
feminized seeds the golden goat will be

370
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,509
straight golden goat I took a golden

371
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,350
goat female and turned it into a male

372
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:38,049
I used that male golden Gopalan and put

373
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,629
that to a golden goat female which will

374
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,309
make seeds it will only have female

375
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,620
chromosomes because there was no male

376
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:46,359
involved i reversed a female it will

377
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,179
only have female chromosomes and it will

378
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,899
only have gold and goat genetics so

379
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:54,939
those seeds will be gold and go s once

380
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,820
now in the same project I am making

381
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,790
lemon Jeffrey lemon Jeffrey is a lemon

382
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:05,890
skunk female pollinated by that reversed

383
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:09,519
golden goat male so that's golden goat

384
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:12,009
pollen with no male chromosomes applied

385
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,399
to a lemon skunk female that will

386
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:18,309
produce feminized lemon Jeffrey are one

387
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,129
seeds now before I get into the R 1 and

388
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:23,708
s 1 let's quickly talk about regular non

389
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,269
feminized seed breeding labels if I were

390
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,698
to breed something non feminized will

391
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,009
use a rise as an example a rise is a

392
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:32,828
golden goat female to a Daybreaker male

393
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:35,289
you would put in parentheses golden goat

394
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:36,819
x Daybreaker in parentheses that's

395
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:41,559
golden goat to Daybreaker that would

396
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,209
make a rise f1f1 indicates first filial

397
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,458
generation which means it's the first

398
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:47,739
time that strain has been crossed if I

399
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:49,689
take that strain and find a male and a

400
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,120
female and breathe them together what

401
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,190
comes out of that will be the f2 and so

402
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,259
forth so that's where the F comes in and

403
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,000
regular seed breeding when you're

404
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,250
breeding with feminized seeds that's

405
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,139
when the F is replaced with R's or

406
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,039
assets now let's talk about the R's and

407
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:08,198
s's let's start with s first if you see

408
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,110
a seed package and it is labeled golden

409
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:14,708
goat s 1 that indicates that those seeds

410
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,269
came from a reversed golden goat female

411
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,609
that was turned into a male that pollen

412
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,429
was used on another golden goat plant

413
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,829
and it is itself the letter S indicates

414
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:26,198
that it is itself and no other genetics

415
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:28,419
were introduced into that cross now good

416
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:31,179
reason for doing that is to preserve

417
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:32,649
genetics let's say that I get tired of

418
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,059
growing golden goat or something goes

419
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,139
wrong and I can't have gold and go

420
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,819
anymore or

421
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,889
let's say maybe there's a fire or a

422
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,579
flood and my golden goat plant gets

423
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:45,429
destroyed I have got s1 seeds of golden

424
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:47,500
goat to keep it in preservation the

425
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:51,129
seeds that I release for golden goat are

426
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,528
s1 seeds because it is a female planet I

427
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:56,078
do not have a male there is no known

428
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:58,509
male of golden goat floating around so

429
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,208
the only way you could make more seeds

430
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:03,939
of golden goat would be to reverse it

431
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,078
and make self seeds out of it make s

432
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,360
ones and that is good for

433
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,828
self-preservation it's also good to get

434
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
those genetics out to people in other

435
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,828
places that don't have access to the

436
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,450
clones you can get the seeds out to

437
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:15,549
people that way everybody's got the

438
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,420
opportunity to grow something similar

439
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:21,639
very similar to golden goat so s stands

440
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:24,159
for self and that is selfing a plant

441
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,350
that is for self preservation and

442
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,838
preserving genes it doesn't adulterate

443
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,060
those genes with anything else if you

444
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,490
were to cross the Golden go to something

445
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,119
else you've created a new cross say the

446
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,129
Daybreaker

447
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,620
then you could find a male that looks

448
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:40,448
like that golden goat and do that to the

449
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,889
original gold and go female and now

450
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,629
you've created a back cross which is

451
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,069
different that's non feminized and

452
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,078
you're gonna have a lot of variation

453
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,540
you're gonna have to work that but the

454
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,328
feminized route the self route there is

455
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:54,698
no adulteration no introduction of new

456
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:56,828
genes so it's really easy to get exactly

457
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:59,229
the golden goat you're looking for so

458
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:02,229
that is selfing selfing is taking a

459
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:05,470
plant and making seeds of itself without

460
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,750
adulterating its genetic makeup now that

461
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,169
we understand selfing let's talk about

462
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,808
our R stands for reversal and r1 is a

463
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,429
first generation of a reversal if I were

464
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,568
to take that feminized golden goat

465
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,880
pollen that we were talking about

466
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:21,188
earlier and put that on a different

467
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,470
plant that is not golden goat now we

468
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,150
have created what's called a reversal

469
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,120
and that will be feminized and it will

470
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,030
be a new cross lemon Jeffrey is an r1

471
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,699
that is feminized golden goat pollen on

472
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:36,730
a lemon skunk female and that makes a

473
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,650
brand new cross so that's a reversal one

474
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,740
it's an r1 as what you would label that

475
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,590
that would be your lemon Jeffrey r1

476
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,900
let's talk more about an r1 what is the

477
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,970
purpose of an r1 the purpose of an r1 is

478
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,950
to create new and unique

479
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,079
crosses I know a lot of people are

480
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,210
haters on FEM seeds but they are very

481
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,949
useful for people with limited plant

482
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,288
counts and for people that can't risk

483
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,179
wasting time and space on having a male

484
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:03,609
plant so there is an application forum I

485
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,450
do not hate them I support them I make

486
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,490
them myself

487
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,558
so the short version of this story would

488
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,589
be if you reversed a plant and put the

489
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,629
pollen on itself that is a self if you

490
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:15,970
reverse a plant and put that pollen on

491
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,570
any other cultivar you have just created

492
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,700
a new reversal both of those the r1 and

493
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:24,490
the s-1 are both feminized now let's

494
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,529
talk about phenotype expectations from

495
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,798
the two of those obviously if you're

496
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:32,079
doing an s-1 you hope to find really

497
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:35,200
close representations of your original

498
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,779
female plant you're going to see some

499
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,308
traits of the parents of that plant but

500
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,288
it's going to be very close

501
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,700
representations of the original plant

502
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,200
you start with some will lean towards

503
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,298
the mom some will lean toward the dad

504
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,250
but most of those phenotypes that come

505
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:50,500
from those femme seeds are going to look

506
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,200
a lot like the original plant you

507
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,470
started with now let's talk about the

508
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,870
phenotypes from reversals reversals show

509
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,089
phenotypes a lot like regular breeding

510
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,678
you're going to see a perfect 50/50

511
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,720
blend of the two parents you start with

512
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,309
you'll see some that look a lot like the

513
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,839
female you started with you'll see that

514
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:09,879
some that look a lot like the dad you

515
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,000
started with you may get little

516
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,140
indicators of the grandparents reversals

517
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,630
are going to show you different

518
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,030
phenotypes a lot like normal breeding

519
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,559
but I think a little bit of variation is

520
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,149
to be desired when you're working with

521
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,099
seeds that's why I like to grow from

522
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,200
seed if I wanted everything to look

523
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,689
exactly the same I would grow from

524
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,460
clones so expect to see a little bit of

525
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,529
phenotypical variation if you're running

526
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,659
reversals if you're running selves out

527
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,879
of a six pack you will definitely find

528
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,010
the one that looks just like the one on

529
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,570
the package or just like the one you saw

530
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:42,129
on the website or just like the one that

531
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:44,200
you smoked somewhere that got you super

532
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,880
excited about it now you've got that

533
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,140
cross now you've got that specific

534
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,150
phenotype and you can grow it for

535
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,190
yourself all the time make sure you take

536
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,470
a clone oh please make sure you take a

537
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,548
clone all right you guys I feel like I

538
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,620
broke down the difference between

539
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:58,569
reversals and self seeds both are

540
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,369
feminized the main difference again is

541
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,220
if I took that pollen from one plant and

542
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:05,489
applied it to itself or apply

543
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,769
Paul in two different plants self is s1

544
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,679
anything else becomes a reversal that's

545
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,879
an r1 keep that in mind always keep in

546
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,500
mind when you're labeling genetic

547
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,299
crosses that you list the female first

548
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,250
ladies first all the time so when you're

549
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,109
listing genetics it should go female X

550
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,130
male that's how you list your crosses

551
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:21,869
then you put the name right up above

552
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,549
that so ladies first all the time when

553
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,439
you're listing genetics I see a lot of

554
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,639
people cross that one up on the internet

555
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,740
and why does it matter because it's a

556
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,210
different cross golden goat to day

557
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,069
breaker and day breaker to golden goat

558
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,159
are two different crosses so that does

559
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:36,178
matter you should list it correctly all

560
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:37,530
right you guys I want to give a couple

561
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,059
of really quick shout out someone to

562
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,069
give a huge shout it's my friend Tyler a

563
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,879
shout out to Miles Porter and a huge

564
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:44,308
shout out to Maddie

565
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,510
E all right you guys before I start

566
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:47,490
wrapping up this show I've got one more

567
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:49,919
thing I'd like to talk about I get a lot

568
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,009
of messages from people asking how do I

569
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,259
get into this industry how do I get a

570
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,929
big gross started how do I move to

571
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,329
Colorado how do I get a facility how do

572
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,309
I get licensed how do I get plants how

573
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:05,609
do I set it up can you teach me to grow

574
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:07,589
can you help me do this the first step

575
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,779
to that you guys is to learn to grow

576
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:13,079
some cannabis don't buy a big facility

577
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:15,658
don't get a big-ass license get a light

578
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,240
get some seeds learn how to germinate a

579
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,880
10 pack of seeds learn how to run a crop

580
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,038
from seed to harvest learn how to

581
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,289
identify males learn how to grow the

582
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,379
product before you even think about a

583
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:30,419
big facility master a small facility I

584
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,070
see so many people that don't know how

585
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,559
to grow I think they're just gonna jump

586
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:37,019
into it and master this you guys I've

587
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,240
been at this for a long time and I still

588
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,339
experience crop problems I still get

589
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,470
spider mites occasionally I still see

590
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:45,389
powdery mildew the thing is I've

591
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,240
experienced it in small enough grows

592
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,919
tour I know how to deal with it and I've

593
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,929
learned how to adjust that to larger

594
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,960
grows when you walk into your

595
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,669
multi-million dollar facility with 250

596
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,529
lights and you see spider mites in there

597
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,640
you're going to [ __ ] your pants because

598
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,589
you've never dealt with it

599
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,720
if you've dealt with it on a small scale

600
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,029
if you've had one pound of cannabis at

601
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,579
risk if that was gonna be your loss from

602
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:10,740
those spider mites that's okay that's

603
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,119
your one pound of extra money that you

604
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,559
were gonna make you may not get to have

605
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,809
as much fun this summer that's cool

606
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,200
when you walk into that facility and you

607
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,720
see 500 pounds at risk from spider mites

608
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,700
you're gonna get anxious you're gonna

609
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,680
sweat in places you didn't know you had

610
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,330
sweat glands it's gonna make you sick to

611
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,200
your [ __ ] stomach you're not gonna be

612
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:31,539
ready for it

613
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,480
you're gonna panic you're gonna do more

614
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,859
[ __ ] wrong to cause more problems before

615
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,750
you think about building a warehouse

616
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,879
before you think about a 10 lighter

617
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,579
before you think about six or four

618
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,650
lights hang up a light learn how to grow

619
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:46,929
build a relationship with the plant

620
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,050
understand the cycles of the plant

621
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,250
understand what that plant needs

622
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,339
understand your goal with the plant

623
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,200
understand why you're doing it before

624
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:58,269
you go build yourself a giant facility

625
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,819
and invest all of your money and risk

626
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:03,730
losing everything figure out if you can

627
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:05,619
do this and also don't become one of

628
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,049
those owners that's just money hungry if

629
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,359
you stop and you build yourself a small

630
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,299
grow and you grow a few plants you'll

631
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,669
build a relationship with the plant not

632
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,109
just a financial relationship you'll

633
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,269
actually have a connection it feels

634
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:20,500
really good to grow cannabis you fall in

635
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,789
love with your garden you fall in love

636
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,910
with your plants and they make you feel

637
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:27,009
good before you even smoke them you get

638
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,110
to feel rewarded because you watch them

639
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:31,059
grow so you won't be one of these money

640
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:33,129
hungry owners you'll actually understand

641
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,230
what's going on you'll understand that

642
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,510
when I tell you this is going to be 14

643
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,240
weeks until I harvest this I've got veg

644
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:42,129
I've got flour then we cut it down a lot

645
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,750
of owners will say 14 weeks huh I'll be

646
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,460
back in 12 weeks we'll cut it down and

647
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,750
you say dude I said 14 and they go yeah

648
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,950
11 weeks sounds great

649
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,569
and you're like wait a minute I thought

650
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,830
I I thought you said 12 last time in the

651
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,929
accountant goes yeah 10 weeks will be

652
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:55,149
perfect like that's how that [ __ ] works

653
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,830
so don't be that guy

654
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,110
build a relationship with the plant

655
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:02,230
understand the cycles understand why the

656
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:03,789
growers are being so meticulous with

657
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,190
what they're doing understand why the

658
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,619
growers need your patience I really

659
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,049
think that starting small with one two

660
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:12,669
maybe three lights at the most is the

661
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,019
way to go I would recommend you start

662
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,550
off with a thousand watt light for

663
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,859
flowering and a thousand watt light for

664
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:20,529
vegging and be able to run a perpetual

665
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:22,509
cycle never have an interruption every

666
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,460
time you cut down a crop move more veg

667
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,109
plants in every time you cut down a crop

668
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,910
move more veg plants in you should

669
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:28,329
always have a cycle going before you can

670
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,340
mask

671
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:32,769
that don't even think about running a

672
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:35,558
large facility so you guys my point here

673
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:37,149
it starts small and then go big because

674
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,798
I see a lot of people try to start these

675
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:40,689
big facilities they run into problems

676
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,849
they were never prepared for they've got

677
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,190
zero experience and it turns into

678
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,648
absolute catastrophic failure and it's

679
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,980
expensive and it's embarrassing so you

680
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:52,928
guys start off small learn small fail

681
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,730
small learn how to correct your failures

682
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,740
on a smaller level and then once you get

683
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,390
good at that [ __ ] then expand and then

684
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,700
you're gonna [ __ ] up that too and learn

685
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,889
how to rescue a bigger crop and if your

686
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,630
main goal is to grow for a commercial

687
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:07,000
production facility or run your own

688
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,700
commercial production facility start

689
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,819
learning commercial horticulture

690
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,409
practices now don't become a home grower

691
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:16,058
don't become a basement grower don't

692
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:18,130
