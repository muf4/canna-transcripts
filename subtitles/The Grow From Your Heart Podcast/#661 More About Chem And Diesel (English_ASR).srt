82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
the discord channel

83
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
i do like the discord it's really uh

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
it's a good way for us to get away from

85
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
social media

86
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
we're kind of reliant on the other

87
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,359
social media companies who have a lot of

88
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,280
control over what we can and cannot post

89
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
and can and cannot say

90
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
especially being a cannabis brand they

91
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,719
do like to uh censor some of the content

92
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,439
that i post and i do fear that some of

93
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,000
my

94
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,079
uh my posts and my uh accounts will be

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,439
removed by some social media brands

96
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
big shout out to cannabis i know

97
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,479
cannabis will never remove my content

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
big thank you for that

99
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,000
some of the other content providers uh

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
the places where we can share social

101
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
media content they may remove our

102
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,719
cannabis

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
content i do appreciate the discord

104
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,439
because it is kind of a middle ground

105
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
between my website and social media the

106
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,800
website i like to keep it kind of

107
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,560
uh professional kind of businessy

108
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
there's not a chat there

109
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,479
there's not a forum there uh it's just a

110
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
place for me to put the business stuff

111
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,000
and the thing about that is i don't know

112
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,000
i could learn how to do it i don't

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
update the website myself i don't do the

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
updates i don't do the website commands

115
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,039
or programming none of that is me

116
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,399
that's another guy that does that big

117
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,878
shout out bro thank you you do a great

118
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
job

119
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,318
i rely on you and you do a wonderful job

120
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,759
at that but that is not my zone

121
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,839
i don't have time to do that what i love

122
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
about the discord is i can post

123
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
real-time updates i can answer questions

124
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
in real time if there's something i want

125
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,158
to do in real time i can manage that on

126
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
discord

127
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,399
so it's a really nice go-between in my

128
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,318
opinion between social media

129
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,719
and between the website i can manage it

130
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,318
i can edit it i can do things on the fly

131
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,158
and i know they're not going to edit me

132
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,919
or censor me like they do quite often on

133
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,560
social media so that's the long way of

134
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,958
saying

135
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,719
come join us on the discord you're

136

140
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,719

places where you get the audio feed the

148

the etsy store is right there you say

203
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,198
why do you have an etsy store when

204
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,279
you've got a professional website

205
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
uh because i can edit that on the fly i

206
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,318
can edit that correct it adjust it

207
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,120
change all the inventory i can do

208
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
everything

209
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
on the fly really quickly super simple

210
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,318
for me

211
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,918
i needed to simplify and streamline some

212
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
things and that was the quickest easiest

213
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,198
way to do it so the

214
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,439
merchandise the non-seed merchandise is

215
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
available on the etsy store

216
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,079
i feel like i'm advertising a lot at the

217
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,599
start of the show let's go a little

218

things i've said on the podcast i'm

252
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,318
trying to find out which one i want to

253
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
do first

254
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400

let's go with uh we'll jump right into

258
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,319
the the one that i think may go along

259
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,199
let's do it let's jump right into it

260
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
this one came

261
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,120
from my friend adam he signed it with

262
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,719
the name adam it doesn't say if he wants

263
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,478
his name said but uh there are a lot of

264
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
atoms out there and you don't know adam

265
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,519
from

266
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,598
adam so it could be any atom it goes a

267
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,439
lot like this it says rosta jeff

268
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,038
i've been a big fan of yours for a while

269
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,478
and i really appreciate the interviews

270
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,560
you've done your strain description

271
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,839
videos and of course your seeds

272
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
i've had the pleasure of growing at

273
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,198
least one pack of each of these and then

274
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
they list several of my strains they've

275
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
got liberation og

276
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
strawberry starburst scarlet begonias

277
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,959

278
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,038

279
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,638
they say thank you for all of it

280
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,079

281
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
first paragraph with bro thank you

282
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,560
that's a lot of stuff to uh start off

283
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
with you've been listening to the

284
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
interviews the strain descriptions

285
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,598
you've been a fan for a while

286
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
and you've grown the seeds ah you're on

287
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,478
the team you're og

288
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
so that's a great way to start now it

289
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,318
says now for the review part

290
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,079
this is where we get critical now i

291
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
enjoy this i invited this sort of stuff

292
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,878
it says concerning your recent breeding

293
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,319
episodes

294
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,158
i wish you would be a little more

295
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,959
technical and accurate about the

296
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,479
breeding terminology and definitions

297
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,478
when you were talking about the scarlet

298
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
begonias and east coast sour diesel to

299
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
blueberry project

300
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,159
it was kind of a letdown to hear you say

301
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,800
technically it's a poly hybrid but we'll

302
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,919
call it an

303
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,919
f1 um yeah i did touch

304
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,360
later on in the episode about how to

305
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,000
make a true f1

306
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
i didn't want to sidetrack myself too

307
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
much

308
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,639
talking about f1s and polyhybrids in

309
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,799
that episode because if you know me

310
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,720
it is very easy to sidetrack me and get

311
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,399
me talking about some random [ __ ]

312
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,000
i was really trying to stay focused on

313
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
that grow lesson but you are right

314
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,639
i was right i said truly we're [ __ ]

315
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,559
with poly hybrids and not f1s

316
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,000
most of what is being bred what we're

317
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,639
buying what we're purchasing is

318
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
probably a poly hybrid not a true f1 the

319
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,199
f2s

320
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,799
are getting us closer if they're even

321
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
f2s because if we started

322
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,838
anyway see that's what i mean i can get

323
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,240
on a good ramble really quickly

324
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,040
so i'm gonna continue with this but i do

325
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
have a nice

326
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,919
reply and i enjoy these respectful uh

327
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
reviews and criticisms i am not taking

328
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,639
this with any uh there's no salt in my

329
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
game here i enjoy this uh but it goes on

330
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,240
to say it's kind of a letdown

331
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,399
if you know better please go into detail

332
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,159
about homozygous and heterozygous

333
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,039
genotypes and why it matters and the

334
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,399
parental stock of true f1 hybrids

335
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,639
i think it would serve the community

336
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,200
well to stop calling all the poly

337
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
uh hybrids f1s very few breeders even

338
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,879
talk about finding or

339
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,439
creating homozygous lines to be the

340
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:04,159
parents for f1s i challenge you to geek

341
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,680
out hard on breeding for us

342
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,838
all right um i am all up for a

343
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,599
challenge of geeking out hard on

344
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,000
breeding but

345
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,839
that's not my goal for the podcast i

346
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,399
appreciate your passion and your desire

347
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,480
to

348
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,399
uh inspire me to go further with reading

349
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
but that's not really what i'm doing

350
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
um and let me let me read my notes and

351
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
get myself back on track

352
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
this is completely correct what you were

353
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,519
saying is correct it was

354
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,839
later on in the episode i did go down

355
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,399
line breeding a little bit to kind of

356
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,600
create a more homogeneous strain

357
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,159
um but in this podcast

358
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
my goal isn't really to go that deep

359
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,240
into breeding

360
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,838
yet i'm 661 episodes in

361
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
and i feel like people are finally

362
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,720
getting a good grasp on how to grow my

363
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,200
goal

364
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
for this podcast is to give you the

365
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,278
basics to get you

366
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
a to get you a good foundation to be a

367
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,399
solid reliable grower to understand the

368
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
plant

369
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
uh i will give in-depth breeding advice

370
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,599
i don't know

371
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
uh maybe i'm just not ready to do it yet

372
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
that's not where the show has evolved my

373
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
goal is to get everybody going

374
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,958
um there are podcasts that are that

375
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
teach much more advanced levels than

376
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,239
mine and there are podcasts that don't

377
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,159
teach as advanced as mine

378
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,159
and i have no judgment around that but i

379
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,838
think that where my audience is right

380
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,639
now where i'm trying to take my audience

381
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
is more to

382
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,360
a self-sustainable self-reliant sort of

383
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
a growth thing

384
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
i feel like a lot of the people that are

385
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,719
trying to breed are already reading the

386
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
books that you're trying to get me to

387
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
talk about which is a good thing

388
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
i will go there but i'm not ready to do

389
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
it and i don't think that the audience

390
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
is ready for it yet no offense to my

391
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,399
audience

392
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
i feel like i will lose some people i'll

393
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
get some people with a notebook taking a

394
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,519
lot of notes

395
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,440
but my goal now at this point in time

396
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,799
for this podcast learning this new gear

397
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
getting this new setup

398
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,240
right now i'm kind of focused on getting

399
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
everybody going i just want to get

400
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,919
there's so many new states legalizing

401
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,200
there's so many new people learning

402
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,639
about cannabis that i just want to make

403
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
sure everybody's got

404
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,560
the prerequisites the basic skills i

405
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
want to be able to drive

406
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,638
change lanes in parallel park once we

407
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,720
can all drive change lanes parallel park

408
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,120
merge properly then i'll start teaching

409
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
us how to do [ __ ] turbo tricks and

410
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,278
fast turns and [ __ ] like that but i

411
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,120
don't uh i just don't want to go there

412
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,958
yet i don't feel like my audience

413
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
um that's not what they're coming to me

414
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,759
for maybe you are because you're asking

415
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
for this but

416
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,679
these are conversations that happen uh

417
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,439
more on the discord channel this is

418
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,958
stuff that i do geek out late at night

419
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
on discord with people

420
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,799
uh so i'll probably sign off with this

421
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,078
podcast later and i'll go to discord and

422
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,359
i'll be hey guys let's talk about

423
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,278
breeding because i've been inspired by

424
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
it and we'll just geek out there

425
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,320
because then it is a two-way

426
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,919
conversation i get some feedback and we

427
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
can talk and you can spark my brain a

428
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,039
little bit

429
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,278
but for here on this podcast i think my

430
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,519
goal is more to get you started and give

431
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,278
you the prerequisites in time and due

432
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,879
time i will teach you all of the

433
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,399
breeding stuff we will clear up all of

434
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,159
those misconceptions

435
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,039
somebody's actually asked a question

436
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,559
about uh myths and misconceptions about

437
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,559
cannabis and about breeding

438
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,599
so i will make sure to include a part

439
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,039
about uh

440
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,120
f1's true f1s in that episode

441
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,278
so our friend adam does include a nice

442
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,278
example of co-dominant alleles

443
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,799
and talking about how to produce uh the

444
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,399
traits that we're looking for

445
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,919
i don't think it's necessary to read all

446
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
of that right now it's kind of a lot for

447
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,199
somebody that doesn't understand

448
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
breeding it talks about finding plants

449
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
breeding

450
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
a pink plant or a red plant to a white

451
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,199
plant when your goal is all pink plants

452
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
it talks about the options and the

453
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
ratios

454
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,039
this is very accurate this is very

455
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
intriguing but i'm not ready to present

456
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,759
this in the podcast

457
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,199
yet it's not uh it's just not what i'm

458
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,278
ready to teach the listeners

459
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
we may talk about this on the discord

460
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,240
this may be a chatter somewhere else but

461
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,119
this is just not what i'm trying to do

462
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
for this show

463
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
i do appreciate it i will touch on the

464
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,078
the obvious fact here is that

465
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
a lot of what we are calling f1s are not

466
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,879
true

467
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
f1s they are polyhybrids a lot of them

468
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,439
have

469
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,679
very similar parents a lot of them have

470
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,839
chem dog or cookies right in the lineage

471
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,359
which kind of right there technically

472
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
makes them a polyhybrid

473
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
when we cross two cookie dominant or

474
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
cookie parented plants together

475
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,198
we've made a polyhybrid we haven't

476
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,759
really done any f1 work

477
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,679
that is very accurate so in the future i

478
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,439
will work out a long episode that has a

479
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,479
lot of this included in it i've got a

480
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
breeding episode

481
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,759
with a lot of myths and misconceptions

482
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,399
that i mentioned that is coming up that

483
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,519
will have

484
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,799
f1s and other stuff included in there

485
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
let me make sure i covered all of my

486
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,198
notes on this because i do write stuff

487
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
on the side of the paper here and

488
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,159
sometimes i get so chattery i don't

489
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,919
cover it um

490
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,278
yeah it looks like i got all of that

491
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,278
stuff for you

492
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,559
and yeah most of my listeners honestly i

493
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,159
don't think and

494
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,759
no disrespect if you are but i think the

495
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,399
majority of my listeners

496
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,759
are here to learn to get a good solid

497
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
foundation on growing

498
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,958
and then we'll catch up to breeding once

499
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
i feel like i've given all that stuff

500
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,599
out again in the video format a lot of

501
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,199
it is available

502
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,120
on the old audio format but i want to

503
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,639
get all that information out again

504
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
in the video format because it's getting

505
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
much more noticed on the youtube channel

506
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,198
and the video

507
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
all right adam thank you for the great

508
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,399
message i hope i give you a satisfactory

509
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
answer

510
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,679
you are correct my dude those are not

511
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,198
true f1s we will talk

512
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,799
deeper about that in the future but

513
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,559
right now i think we're on the right

514
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,399
path for this podcast

515
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,599
all right let's move forward to another

516
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,679
message

517
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,159
in a previous episode i told a story

518
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,679
about chem dog and the story of the 13

519
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,078
beans i mentioned a guy named uh let's

520
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,359
see i mentioned a guy named aj

521
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:31,599
in my mind i was confusing joe brand

522
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,839
and aj aj is known as [ __ ] joe

523
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
uh who honestly from what i read is not

524
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
an [ __ ] i've seen him on podcasts

525
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
i've seen him at events

526
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,320
doesn't seem like an [ __ ] but he got

527
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,279
the nickname [ __ ] joe back in the day

528
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,959
in my mind i was honestly mixing up

529
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,120
since there's joe and joe

530
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,119
and i got a brain injury i just jot them

531
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
right together and made that one person

532
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
those are two

533
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,920
different people so joe brand and

534
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
[ __ ] joe

535
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,319
are two different people in the story i

536
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
told about kim dog and the legend of the

537
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,519
13 beans you're gonna have to swap out

538
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,079
the name aj

539
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,078
and put in joe brand every time then

540
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,919
that story will be accurate to the best

541
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,278
of my knowledge i've gotten a correction

542
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,679
and i'm acknowledging that

543
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,320
so let's just edit that just do that

544
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,919
thing in

545
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
on the google documents where you just

546
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,519
replace and every time i said one word

547
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,360
just replace it with another

548
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,360
but there is a connection

549
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
there is a connection to why i was

550
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
putting joe brandon [ __ ] joe in the

551
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,399
same story

552
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:33,679
um [ __ ] joe

553
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,879
is where the sour diesel comes from

554
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,319
and the sour diesel is related to the

555
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,838
chem dogs i'm going to talk about that

556
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
just because we happen to have pulled

557
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,880
this story out just because it happened

558
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,758
this way

559
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,958
um so if you've heard of the aj's cut of

560
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
sour diesel

561
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,879
aj is the one who is known for making

562
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
the sour diesel popular

563
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,879
that sour diesel that goes around in

564
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,638
colorado that uh it stinks up the car

565
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,639
you got to put it in two baggies

566
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,159
the good sour diesel makes my eyes itch

567
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,759
it makes them feel kind of funny when i

568
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,000
smoke it which i enjoy

569
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,519
my eyes get itchy and super bloody red

570
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,599
which a lot of herb doesn't make my eyes

571
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,078
red anymore but that sour d will get to

572
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
it

573
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,678
uh and it i was just the diesel some

574
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,160
other people added the word

575
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,559
salad to it uh we may touch on that that

576
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,679
may be a totally different podcast but

577
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:23,119
let's delve a little bit into this so

578
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,439
um there was the chem dog

579
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,279
uh story that i talked about right uh

580
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
legend of kim dog in the 13 beans two

581
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,558
guys in colorado

582
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
peabud and joe brand get some herb they

583
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,079
call it the dog bud

584
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,519
um they go to a grateful dead show they

585
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,439
meet a guy who uh

586
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,759
wasn't called chem dog yet later on in

587
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,880
the future gets the name chem dog

588
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:46,000
um they become friends joe brand

589
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,559
and pee bud later on male

590
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
chem dog has not chem dog yet but he's

591
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,200
about to become chem dog in the story

592
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
mail him some herb

593
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
uh in one of the ounces i read there

594
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
were two ounces one didn't have any

595
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840
seeds the other one had 13

596
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,960
seeds so he pulled some seeds out and he

597
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,720
grows them

598
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,558
um they were calling the weed the dog

599
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,558
bud or the chem weed because it would

600
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,879
make you roll over like a dog or lazy

601
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,599
like a dog and it smelled like chemicals

602
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
so it got dubbed the chem dog and the

603
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,038
guy that grew it and found it

604
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,879
found the seeds in there he became known

605
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,000
as chemdog he grew some seeds there was

606
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,559
chem dog 91

607
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,319
kim's sister uh and then a couple other

608
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,200
uh variations of kim there was a male

609
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,798
that was pulled

610
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
there are more seeds sitting around

611
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,200
which may get grown in the future here

612
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,519
so

613
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
uh this guy chemdog he's growing weed

614
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,319
right he starts

615
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,080
he's also a glass blower and he goes to

616
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,200
grateful dead concerts to sell his glass

617
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,558
and to have a good time because that's a

618
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,759
great place to go sell some pipes and

619
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,079
make some friends

620
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,759
uh so kim is selling some pipes and he

621
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,399
meets this guy named aj

622
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,919
who is known as [ __ ] joe but [ __ ]

623
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,038
joe is not an [ __ ] he's a cool guy

624
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,480
shout out to aj

625
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,400
um they uh sell they sell each other a

626
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
pipe kim sells aj a pipe

627
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,600
and just being bros kim's like well

628
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
let's smoke a bowl out of it he made the

629
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,159
pipe he hasn't smoked out of it because

630
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,919
you don't smoke out until you sell it

631
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
he's like can we smoke out of it

632
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,280
and aj's like sure but let's smoke some

633
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,880
of my weed because i got some good weed

634
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,240
and kim's like nah bro i don't know i

635
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,600
got some fire wheat and they both pull

636
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,558
out their weed and guess what they both

637
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,879
had

638
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,079
they both had the dog bud they both had

639
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
the original dog

640
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,279
bud so it's kind of a bonding moment

641
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,279
they became friends at that moment we

642
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,319
got two legends in the cannabis industry

643
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,399
becoming friends at this time uh dog bud

644
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,839
and dog bud in two different bags from

645
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
two legendary [ __ ] people in the

646
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,839
industry so

647
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,079
aj and kim have now met and that's where

648
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,000
i think i blended the story in my head

649
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,079
so uh they got the same weed it's the

650
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,558
original dog bud now this is where

651
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,199
the story gets interesting they were

652
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,440
calling

653
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
aj was calling his dog bud diesel

654
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,919
because

655
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,360
uh anything he's from new york and

656
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,880
anything that they were smoking in new

657
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,719
york that was good weed

658
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,559
was called diesel like now the kids call

659
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,839
anything that is good gas which i think

660
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,558
is funny because

661
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,959
gas should be weed that smells like gas

662
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,038
not

663
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,558
weed that smells like [ __ ] berries if

664
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,919
it smells like berries why you calling

665
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,160
it gas bro

666
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,520
quit doing that please culture uh but

667
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,519
they would just call anything that was

668
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,960
good diesel that'd be some diesel weed

669
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,558
and i think that came from candidates

670
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,519
i've got canadian friends that call cool

671
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,158
[ __ ] diesel

672
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,240
that's diesel so that probably came from

673
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,120
canadian terminology anyway

674
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,919
uh the rumor has it this is what i have

675
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,079
pulled out

676
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,080
uh from folklore from the internet from

677
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,439
history from people that i know

678
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,678
i know a couple of people in the weed

679
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,880
industry i know a couple of podcasters i

680
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
know a few of the guys that might have

681
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
been involved in this

682
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,760
the story is that a mass super skunk

683
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
plant

684
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,038
accidentally pollinated aj's chem dog

685
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,159
plant

686
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:37,038
and that is where we got the diesel i

687
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
later on became sour diesel uh because

688
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,200
there was a crew that was selling it

689
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
and they were souwa they were mad about

690
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,319
other people or other people it would

691
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
the weed was so good it would make other

692
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,200
people mad and it was pissing people off

693
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,360
and causing rivalries

694
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
and so the word sour got attached to it

695
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,038
the sour diesel

696
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,960
that's the story that i've got for you

697
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,879
that's what i think happened that makes

698
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,640
the most sense from all of the [ __ ] i

699
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
have filtered from the internet the

700
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,720
interviews i've listened to on podcasts

701
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,918
uh and just things i know

702
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,079
about the industry so um this guy

703
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,759
kim he's got the chem dog weed he meets

704
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,319
up with a guy named aj and they both

705
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,679
have

706
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,480
the chem dog herb it turns out that aj

707
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,759
had a mass super skunk plant that either

708
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,038
hermed or was a male

709
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,960
the story is that it hurt it

710
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,359
accidentally pollinated the chem

711
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,159
and made the diesel so that goes back to

712
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,199
a couple of episodes that i talked about

713
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,320
bag seed bro bag seed accidental seed

714
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,558
can be the most

715
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,678
fire [ __ ] i'm talking about sour diesel

716
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,960
one of the most

717
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,559
popular strains ever ever in new york it

718
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,759
was one of the most popular things ever

719
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:45,200
in colorado

720
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,960
uh in the 2009 2000 about 2005 2010 era

721
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640
there was a group south of me that was

722
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
growing this sour diesel

723
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,919
that i would line up if i knew where to

724
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
get a bunch of it i would line up and

725
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,200
buy it all

726
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,240
it was so good it would make my eyes

727
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,919
funky it would give me

728
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,839
it's hard to give me like a paranoid

729
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,360
kind of like in my zone kind of high at

730
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,879
this point i've been smoking for so long

731
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,439
i got to take a few dabs to get there to

732
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,440
get the

733
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,960
the smoke sweats and the paranoia but

734
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,400
that sour diesel would make it feel

735
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,679
weird you'd go in the grocery store and

736
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
you'd think everyone's staring at you

737
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
nobody's looking at you

738
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
but you just feel like everybody is

739
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,480
staring at you the ice cream aisle would

740
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
pulsate when you walk down it and [ __ ]

741
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,319

telling now they're the forefathers of

765
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
cannabis history so that's [ __ ]

766
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
awesome they were doing this

767
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
uh they were working it and hustling it

768
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
before there was any thought of cannabis

769
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,360
legalization

770
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,879

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,840
question for you and then we're gonna

777
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,120

779
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,558

780
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,159
name said so i'm not going to say it

781
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,639
it says ross to jeff i was watching a

782
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,880
video and i love it i had a great laugh

783
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
um let's see we're going to get to the

784
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
question it says may i ask you a

785
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,440
question

786
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,440
can you have too much air movement over

787
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
your girls from oscillating fans then

788
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,000
they do explain

789
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,038
their environment their setup and um

790
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,319
yes you can absolutely have too much

791
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,000
airflow too much wind on your plants

792
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,839
sometimes the plants will start to look

793
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
like they're getting leathery or paper

794
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,399
read the leaves

795
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,159
just don't look right and it doesn't

796
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,679
look like a deficiency

797
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,600
it just doesn't look like bugs are

798
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,278
hitting it something just looks sad

799
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,240
they're getting wind burned

800
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,359
uh if the leaves right by the fan look a

801
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,720
little bit shitty if they're getting

802
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,639
crispy if they look dry

803
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
you are just blowing all of the water

804
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
they're chapped they're chafed

805
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,038
uh they're getting wind burned they've

806
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,479
been on the boat all day and their faces

807
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,119
all just dried out and they need some

808
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,599
[ __ ]

809
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,239
uh some some lotion bro so yeah you do

810
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,158
need to

811
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,359
minimize that amount of air on those

812
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,039
plants that wind burn

813
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,639
will cause damage it will slow down the

814
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,240
growth uh and you're just

815
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,159
uh you're creating just a bad

816
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,720
environment right there in that one area

817
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
slow down that fan uh move it maybe if

818
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,038
you have to if you can

819
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,959
i know you're in a tent so you don't

820
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,400
have all the options but turn that [ __ ]

821
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
down bro you don't need so much

822
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,919
fan movement in there temps and humidity

823
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,360
are great um

824
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,038
yeah you can mess them up with that fan

825
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,558
so if you're seeing problems they're to

826
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,599
look leathery papery they'll start

827
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,119
clawing

828
