47
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,359
got a point Mike might post a whole

48
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:56,089
bunch of great cannabis related news and

49
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,609
information there's there are several

50
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,049
Facebook pages that are cannabis haters

51
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,569
and they like to post a bunch of

52
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:05,960
[ __ ] and Mike only post the truth I

53
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,699
support 99% of what Mike post and what I

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,590
don't agree with is just like

55
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,629
opinionated stuff from other writers

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,979
having opinions on things the science

57
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:16,129
and the facts on the politics

58
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,840
I [ __ ] agree right it's it's fun

59
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,259
because I hate on that page from both

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,370
sides of the cannabis argument I get

61
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,399
activists that are upset that I won't

62
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,709
post their latest meme and I think it

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,299
anti-pop people pissed that I exist at

64
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,180
all and keep the bunking there [ __ ]

65
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:34,129
the meme game is a whole different

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,110
that's that's middle school and we're

67
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:38,329
trying to play college level cannabis

68
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,659
politics here likes to take you late the

69
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,219
argument is sort of the pages basic go

70
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:53,930
ahead and feed that music at its awkward

71
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:55,370
limits that lowering it down let me do a

72
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,439
little correction on the last episode

73
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,049
there's a group called pl grow that's

74
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,239
gonna send me a test item they've got a

75
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,769
product for me to review I haven't quite

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,569

77
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,819

78
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:10,128

79
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:15,500

80
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:16,848

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,259

83
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:25,669
yeah yeah I apologize you guys and now

84
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,589
you got to shout outs on the show

85
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,479
instead of just one because I made a

86
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,079
mistake

87
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,399
alright so gosh Mike I don't know what

88
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,319
happened dude Mike went down to go smoke

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
a cigarette before the podcast and while

90
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,138
he was out there I just started coughing

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,349
my throat just started acting like man

92
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,000
and my lung started juicing up on me and

93
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:46,189
before the show my traditional cough

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
didn't really materialize did you get it

95
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:51,739
I may have taken your cough I may have a

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,989
sympathy cough for you is that possible

97
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,750
is that a real thing - her magic bro

98
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,310
magic sympathy dab cough I took plenty

99
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,900
of dads maybe I had a delayed cough I

100
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,370
was smoking some of the uh what did I

101
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,750
have the Killer Queen I can have

102
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:08,299
annoying full-spectrum extract it was

103
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,469
really tasty I made me dad now but after

104
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,919
a couple of minutes it just made me

105
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,209
start like he starts heating the Banger

106
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,620
and immediately the room smelled

107
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,139
delicious that's because I've been

108
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,209
smoking ah the beautiful miss Jenny Beth

109
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,389
went to apothecary and she got some of

110
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,649
the Clementine she got the I don't know

111
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,598
I think she had the high cannabinoid

112
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,009
full-spectrum extract and I picked up

113
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:29,899
some of the high turk full-spectrum

114
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,598
extract so we were tag-team dabbing each

115
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:35,029
other and then we went a little hard on

116
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:36,740
the Terps and put in the nail and it

117
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:38,059
just tastes like that forever and then

118
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,139
I've been pouring a lot of B I've got

119
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,569
these little lemon Jeffrey

120
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,449
Turpin full-spectrum extract that's the

121
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,098
flavor I just pour this in there dude I

122
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,750
just pour these little things like but

123
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:49,579
two maybe three or four drops depending

124
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,769
on where I'm trying to go should a small

125
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,668
dab and four drops of this hey dude you

126
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,658
just blow clouds and there's something

127
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:58,810
there's cannabinoids in this it's not

128
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:01,129
just pure Terps but it's mostly Terps

129
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,310
turfs have a lot to do with where the

130
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:08,030
high goes absolutely absolutely i think

131
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,310
i think the THC makes you go it makes

132
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:12,049
you go up and then the Terps to decide

133
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,579
if you get the munchies if you get an i

134
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,098
high if you get creative if you want to

135
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,439
do the dishes if you get panicky I think

136
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:21,800
the Terps are all about pain relief pain

137
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,718
relief okay there's a bunch of different

138
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,319
stuff that the Terps are affecting it's

139
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:28,908
not just fun aspects the hi it's it's

140
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,250
medical aspects of it too

141
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:33,500
alright I think the limonene which is

142
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,199
what this is names that's my personal

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,339
take I feel like that so I doubt a way

144
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,879
too much on the show I've got a brain

145
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,429
injury

146
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,560
sometimes it feels like my brain skips

147
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:47,050
like an old CD like and I could feel it

148
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,050
it just like the song will be played a

149
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:53,389
lot of people are going what remember

150
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,399
CDs you guys back in the day these

151
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,009
silver shiny things so a lot of those

152
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:05,448
used to skip anyway you it would sound

153
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:07,189
like this boom dude dude sometimes my

154
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,598
brain does the key part and it's from a

155
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:11,088
[ __ ] traumatic brain injury there's a

156
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,209
dent in my brain where information skips

157
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:16,038
I don't know it sometimes there it goes

158
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,388
uh and it seems like dumb [ __ ] that I

159
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:18,769
don't really need to remember is what

160
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,629
left a lot of the important [ __ ] has

161
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,399
been coming back right but I feel like

162
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,870
the limonene puts a little patch in the

163
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,758
divot it puts some bondo in the brain

164
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,709
dent and it helps that the bridge they

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,788
got broken it helps it reconnect you

166
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:35,750
when I get the black cherry flavor okay

167
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:37,788
I I know that along with that flavor I'm

168
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,189
gonna get a really nice hit of pain

169
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:44,598
relief in about four to eight minutes

170
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:46,399
okay and it's part that cannabinoids

171
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:50,000
that's really helpful with the pain

172
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,099
relief CBD CBD op sorry on Friday I can

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,439
tell you can think about CBD I

174
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,970
looking at new lights flashing on the

175
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,800
board across from me and I got

176
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,100
distracted and dabbed out sorry folks

177
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,770
turn off the iPad CD and then common

178
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,189
terpenes that you find alongside CBD

179
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:09,829
that add that flavor to it my tongue

180
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,449
knows that like when that hits my eyes

181
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,829
light up and I start looking for where

182
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,300
it came from and where I can get more of

183
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:17,289
it I did an episode a while back called

184
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,870
follow your nose because I believe that

185
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,970
your body and your nose know what's best

186
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,379
for you that's why that's why oranges

187
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,640
smell and I said this in the other

188
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,139
episode I'm just repeating myself at

189
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,789
this point but that's why I said oranges

190
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,740
smell good and [ __ ] smells bad you're

191
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,120
supposed to eat oranges oranges make you

192
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,500
feel good they have vitamin C their

193
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,209
natural sugar there's fiber there's

194
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,319
other stuff in there I don't know

195
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,399
there's fiber in there but I assume

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,409
it'll be fiber and calcium in the

197
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,519
goddamn orange [ __ ] you're not supposed

198
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,140
to eat that that's why it smells bad

199
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,680
there's [ __ ] in there it's already been

200
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:47,839
done there's a reason 99% of people

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,420
salivate when they smell me over fire

202
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,759
yeah like that's how people didn't die

203
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,759
of starvation for most of our history

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,740
when you like when you're in a

205
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,160
supermarket you're just a little bit

206
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,720
hungry

207
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,640
and you get hit with that fresh fruit

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,100
smell like off the oranges for me yeah

209
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,589
just stare at him and I'm like alright I

210
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,939
have to buy four yep that doesn't happen

211
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,679
so much with the pears for me

212
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,600
miss Jenny Beth she loves oranges

213
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,110
oranges is her turf that's the one that

214
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,390
fixes her her that's her medical and her

215
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,370
recreational smoke my kid was mad for

216
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,709
citrus anything citrus I love the lemon

217
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,930

222
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,370
live endure is what she likes she told

223
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,189
me that lavender and lilacs are her type

224
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,870
of thing which is really funny because

225
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,060
lilacs in lavender make me feel like I

226
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,220
inhaled something I feel part of C I

227
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,889

230
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:55,490
they're supposed to be calming and

231
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,170
relaxing smells and they honestly just

232
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,450

258
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:02,159

259
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,318

260
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,759
bullet ok what's your answer oh I want

264
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,610
grow book why the girl book read the

265

[ __ ] we're done take a fat dad view

268
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:26,578
remote for me there's a reason that's

269
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:30,329
the only silver bullet if you've never

270
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:31,979
grown cannabis before you don't know

271
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,750
what you're getting into you don't know

272
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,920
what the parameters are you don't know

273
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,629
what its needs are and are going to be

274
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,448
down the line as it progresses through

275
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,360
its lifecycle he's the easiest way to

276
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:47,039
get that [ __ ] figured out and get going

277
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,310
successfully is to go to a book store

278
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,088
pick out a Negro book on the shelf buy

279
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,708
and read it

280
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,550
this guy's got two or three of the best

281
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:59,009
cannabis growers as teachers I'm one of

282
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:01,289
his teachers he sees me on a daily basis

283
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,909
he's got another guy that is a very good

284
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,338
teacher that's been to his grow also and

285
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,719
will help him out but he was in you're

286
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,250
right bike you're you're [ __ ] so

287
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,379
right I I can't believe I didn't tell

288
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,240
him yes go buy a damn grow book dude but

289
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,278
I was like no honestly there is no one

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,180
magic bullet he thought that if he

291
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,830
bought a specific light

292
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,479
he would do it he thought that maybe I

293
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,028
could tell him by this bottle and it

294
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,589
would do it but I had to tell him

295
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:25,419
there's no secret weapon do there's no

296
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,550
ninja sword there's no you can't just

297
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:30,129
get one thing Oh what I had to explain

298
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:31,990
him was and this is just my opinion the

299
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,730
girl book is the secret weapon you guys

300
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,879
to everything knowledge is key so go get

301
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,289
yourself a girl book I recommend there's

302
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,330
an n rows and Thal book it's the

303
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,980
Oaksterdam course guide I highly

304
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,629
recommend that book that is a good book

305
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,009
the problem with the Gro book is like

306
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:46,750
every six months they're [ __ ]

307
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,350
outdated that's why I do a podcast well

308
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,120
the nice thing about any grow any grow

309
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,940

310
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,149
advanced ones the more topical ones

311
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,279
they're gonna cover the basics and I

312
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:03,580
mean it's like anything there is an

313
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,110
advanced class knowing a lot more will

314
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,899
produce some significantly better

315
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,610
results but if you know the basic rules

316
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,458
of the game you can take your ass to any

317
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,039
[ __ ] field and play right and if you

318
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:19,329
sit down and read a Negro book it's

319
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:22,000
gonna lay out here's the ABCDE basic

320
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,129

325
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,379
harvesting here's a small list of common

326
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,149
pitfalls that people fall into look out

327
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,439
for right you actually just nailed a

328
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,120
couple of things that I was gonna what I

329
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
was gonna mention to the person that

330
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,389
asked me this question I told it

331
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,519
basically what I told was there's no

332
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,199
magic secret weapon it's everything yeah

333
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,360
everything is what matters the most it's

334
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,490
you have to dial in everything the

335
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,080
plants start at a ten the plants start

336
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,539
at their highest potential they are

337
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,370
tense and basically we [ __ ] them up by

338
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:03,458
limiting them so you have to find out

339
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:06,129
how to limit them and get out of their

340
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:08,708
way as much as you can you have to and I

341
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,970
wrote down la WS laws is something that

342
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,699
every grower should know about its

343
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,290
lights air water and soil those are the

344
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,028
main things you need to worry about you

345
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,969
have to have the best lighting you can

346
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,740
get I I suggest that you have to have

347
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,310
the best you get put the best lighting

348
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,528
you can afford and maintain and maintain

349
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,629
in your grow space yes if you've got a

350
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:28,970
small space don't put a 2000 watt [ __ ]

351
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,828
it's

352
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,660
in there if you've got a small space go

353
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:35,000
get yourself a t5 go get yourself a

354
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:36,889
[ __ ] LED and put it in the small

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,198
space if you've got big space put big

356
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,269
lights in there oh yeah every time I

357
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,609
answer this question the person I'm

358
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,188
talking to seems incredibly hesitant to

359
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,860
take the advice of go by the book

360
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:51,860
because they're excited it can't be that

361
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,459
hard it's a weed your high ass can do it

362
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,129
right it doesn't seem complicated at the

363
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,799
beginning and honestly if you could just

364
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,899
take the seed you found in your bag out

365
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,528
in your backyard in water with your

366
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,809
sprinklers like you do your flowerbed

367
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:11,480
and not get robbed and killed or

368
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:14,000
arrested for doing so it would be a lot

369
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,009
simpler but because you're attempting to

370
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,188
take something out of its environment

371
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:21,740
and create an environment where it will

372
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,389
thrive artificially there's some ground

373
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,350
rules that you just need to familiarize

374
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,938
yourself with and honestly when until

375
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,550
you sit down and write the book you

376
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:34,250
don't really like triple-check am i

377
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:37,758
hitting every point that a new person is

378
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,769
gonna need to know be successful I went

379
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,808
and did a consult for a dude when I was

380
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,028
first starting out doing consulting and

381
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:45,438
I forgot like three important things

382
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:47,568
when I was there the first day that I

383
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:49,068
didn't think about till I got home and I

384
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:51,558
said the dude along he goes look dude

385
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,599
I'm really sorry but this this and this

386
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,610
don't know why that didn't occur to me

387
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,769
yesterday really sorry I didn't include

388
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,139
all of this information during your

389
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,789
physical consult

390
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,209
feel free to ask me more questions over

391
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:06,039
email

392
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,039
sorry bro not driving back northglenn

393
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,720
but it just happens in when you get to

394
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:13,250
the point of publishing a grou guide you

395
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,959
and a couple other growers have gone

396
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,909
over and been like yep bro you hit all

397
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,909
the steps that's how you go from the

398
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:21,049
dugout to home plate right once you got

399
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:23,058
the book you still got to worry about

400
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:26,179
you've got the grill built and now your

401
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:27,828
plants are growing and you still can't

402
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:29,539
just buy one thing to put in that grow

403
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:31,128
you've got to get good lights and then

404
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,480
you got to get I recommend the kavita's

405
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,399
if you've got a big space if you've got

406
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,289
a little space if they could be to 750 s

407
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,360
or the 650 s and then just work your way

408
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,250
down based on your space then you need

409
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,350
good nutrients if you don't have and

410
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,860
there's no magic nutrients you can buy

411
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,870
you got to do

412
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,639
the research and you got to find figure

413
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,810
out if you want to use organic figure

414
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,990
out if you want to use non-organic

415
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,029
figure out it's up to you how you want

416
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,620
to do it it's all the more non organic

417
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,120
and this may a lot of people are gonna

418
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,639
argue with me but this is my opinion the

419
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,919
more non-organic you go the more bottle

420
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,389
base you get the more simple it is but

421
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,949
when you work more towards the organics

422
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,350
there's a little more work to it but

423
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,920
it's also a little more pleasing product

424
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,509
to some people to know it's all organic

425
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,399
Mike just gave me kind of a know there's

426
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:14,960
there's boy I know a couple of organic

427
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,429
people that like they could spend three

428
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,720
years trying to teach me their method

429
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,419
and I'd only know a part of it right

430
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,910
right and I know bottled people the same

431
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:29,179
way I was just picturing in my head the

432
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:31,579
full advanced line you can do everything

433
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,919
the advanced nutrients line does with

434
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,550
veg bloom and two or three bottles of

435
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,079
extra additives and this is where taking

436
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:42,259
the time to do a little research and

437
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,540
education comes in incredibly handy go

438
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,429
to the gross store ask the person behind

439
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,289
the counter doesn't ask the gross tour

440
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:50,000
dude the gross tour dude is paid to sell

441
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,459
a certain [ __ ] brand he uses this

442
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,470
brand one thing that pisses me off about

443
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,200
gross stores and it also happens at

444
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,060
Guitar Center it happens it Best Buy you

445
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,050
go somewhere and Guitar Center is

446
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,489
[ __ ] notorious for this do you like

447
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,319
hey I want to buy these kind of

448
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,819

449
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,740
sticks bro I played these sticks they're

450
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,879
all that [ __ ] matter and he spins his

451
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,079
sticks and flips his hair around like

452
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,970
he's cooler than everybody and I'm like

453
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,309
I don't [ __ ] care about your emo band

454
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,779
I want these sticks that came for and so

455
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,279
I feel like they do the same [ __ ] at

456
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:18,259
gross virgia like a man I came to buy

457
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,029
botanic and like [ __ ] the tiny camera I

458
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,680
use psycho bro that's all that matters

459
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,480
and they treat you like they're better

460
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,900
than you and I would like push whatever

461
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,730
brand whose rep has a special going on

462
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,830
that month or whichever brand threw them

463
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,450
free [ __ ] yeah or whichever brand gave

464
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:34,099
them a [ __ ] hammers about to expire

465
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,210
look and see what shirt they're wearing

466
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,740
and if that's what they're pitching you

467
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,779
I mean somebody's [ __ ] doing it it's

468
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,730
yeah so there are plenty of places to do

469
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:43,160
your research on what's new and what's

470
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,620
what's gear to get I have been using for

471
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,000
years botanic air pure blend Pro they've

472
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:49,609
been bought out by a company that I'm

473
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,230
not sure I want to support so when I run

474
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,299
out of botanic air pure blend Pro

475
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,799
product pure blend of pro of products

476
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,720
that's hard to [ __ ] to say winner is

477
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,210
high

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,789
I think I'm going to switch to another

479
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,230
brand if it is small and I don't know if

480
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,049
I want to say the name of the company on

481
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,339
the show right now because I I'm gonna

482
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,849
switch to new millennium I'll be using

483
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:13,250
veg bloom base with new millennium

484
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:16,219
additives and shine and plus life and

485
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,319
mammoth peat that's what I plan on

486
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,299
switching to in the long run it'll be a

487
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,759
slow process because I've got a lot of

488
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,559
botanic hair products left but once

489
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:29,720
those are gone it'll be replaced with

490
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,919
new millennium yeah but [ __ ] happens

491
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,930
it's big companies and that's gonna

492
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,720
happen so I would recommend veg bloom is

493
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,230
great if you want something simple a veg

494
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,569
bloom

495
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,950
I like the veg bloom the one for the

496
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:41,359
dirty it's it's called dirty it's for

497
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,500
hard water most you guys probably live

498
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,779
in an area where you've got hard water

499
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,140
so you want the dirty veg bloom dirty

500
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:51,559
I had shine add plus life spring with

501
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,600
push and then maybe add like some

502
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,609
mammoth pee it's not even necessary if

503
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,929
you're using the plus life I was using

504
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,569
the mammoth pee to start him to get him

505
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,490
going faster and then maybe something

506
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,619
you might need some cal-mag in there

507
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,019
maybe a kelp product just to beat them

508
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:08,449
up but honestly the plus the veg bloom

509
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,519
with the plus life the shine and the

510
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,490
push spray is you can get through the

511
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,859
whole process with that if what Jeff

512
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,620
said just now didn't make a lot of sense

513
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:20,689
to you please go buy the book or go to

514
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,579
the vegetable website they don't pay me

515
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,350
or anything I just like the veg bloom

516
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,909
products they're super easy to use and

517
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,740
they give great results and listen to

518
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,040
back episodes of the show or the correct

519
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,509
strain for cush type strains veg blooms

520
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,940
[ __ ] awesome for other strains it

521
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:37,670
doesn't do as well if you've got like an

522
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,559
OG Kush or a grateful dog type of strain

523
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,640
the veg bloom will do wonderfully it

524
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,389
felt like I was trying to get it

525
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,550
something else

526
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,270
but for certain strains it'll do a

527
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:49,009
really good job it's real simple

528
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:52,039
oh it's gonna say to go to hydroponic

529
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,960
research com hydroponic - research calm

530
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,309
that's the veg bloom website all their

531
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,500
informations there they'll be feed

532
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:59,899
charts it's real easy just there's

533
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,480
[ __ ] three three dry products and a

534
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,430
foliar spray super simple I'm gonna quit

535
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,380
pitching bedroom there pay me so you got

536
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,029
good nutrients you have to get your pH

537
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,040
dialed in you have to find out what pH

538
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,399
those plants like start at 6 5 and see

539
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,019
what

540
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,200
with your planets learn how do I

541
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,009
identify pH problems raise them up or

542
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,920
down if you need to

543
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:20,900
I hardly ever check the pH of my soil I

544
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,550
haven't ever checked the pH of the soil

545
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,560
in the [ __ ] commercial reason Coco

546
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,509
I've never checked the pH of the Coco at

547
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,039
the commercial girl I checked the runoff

548
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:29,960
I checked the pH of the runoff and I

549
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,700
checked the EC the electrical

550
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,009
conductivity of the runoff but I do not

551
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,269
check the [ __ ] Coco itself I can tell

552
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,339
what's going on by what goes in and what

553
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,139
comes out another thing you to keep in

554
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:41,720
mind is the co2 you guys are you on

555
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,870
menteng co2 you can give it a lot of co2

556
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,549
the natural environment rocks around 400

557
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:49,250
ppm s of co2 depends on where you are

558
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:52,639
these plants can take I've seen people

559
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,910
push them up in the 2200 ppm of car wash

560
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,860
to run around 15 yeah we rock about 1500

561
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,600
at the big row but you can push them

562
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,679
temperatures you've got a dial in

563
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,269
temperatures do you have temperature

564
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,620
swings is it too hot during the day is

565
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,789
it too cold during the night is it too

566
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,739
hot during the night too cold during the

567
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:09,019
day any of that is gonna [ __ ] with your

568
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,339
planet so there's no one magic thing so

569
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,990
far I've already read off like a list of

570
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:13,939
seven or eight things moisture in the

571
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:18,410
soil moisture in the room floor

572
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:20,450
temperature temperature I I've got a

573
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,029
tour of a major facility not that long

574
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,920
ago plants on concrete in February

575
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:27,769
[ __ ] yeah you can't do that in

576
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,350
Colorado take off your shoes and walk

577
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,539
around on the concrete that's the first

578
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:35,779
time I saw that in a how to build your

579
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,039
grow room video dude in the video is he

580
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,559
showing people how to build his little

581
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,940
room in Amsterdam bust his shoes and

582
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,919
socks off and walks around on the floor

583
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,440
he's like this is way too cold and he

584
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,990
goes and installs some pads on the floor

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,610
yeah and I just rocked my world I never

586
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,069
would have thought of that before but it

587
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,629
get huge effect you've got these pots

588
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:54,950
filled with dirt and roots and then

589
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,140
you're gonna pour water into it it's

590
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,580
gonna get cold it's ice cold on that

591
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,310
floor yep and if you're in a warehouse

592
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:05,539
or a basement it's gonna get you super

593
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:09,109
chilly the acronym you gave out earlier

594
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:11,869
I like that the four points that it hid

595
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:13,729
and I liked it it spelled out laws it's

596
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,759
the laws is the one thing we didn't

597
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,740
bring up so far in [ __ ] you should take

598
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,700
a minute to look up if you want to be

599
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,170
successful growing dude the local laws

600
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,990
you're gonna want to know those

601
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:30,380
they're gonna apply they're gonna impact

602
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,750
yeah we live in a legal state it's

603
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,760
totally legal to grow here the smell of

604
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,509
marijuana is no longer probable cause in

605
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,879
Colorado I had cops pounding on my door

606
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:43,910
wondering if I knew my neighbor because

607
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,170
they thought he was growing in why he

608
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,910
wouldn't answer his door and I was like

609
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,140
he ain't home bro and they're like what

610
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,548
do you mean and I was like there's six

611
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,830
cars in the driveway but the one he

612
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:54,019
drives every day they're like have a

613
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,250
nice day and they's you know kept

614
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,569
talking to me and they're like yeah we

615
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,150
know he's growing a whole bunch of weed

616
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:00,710
because and get this folks they accused

617
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,548
him of screwing up people's cable

618
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:07,160
connections and their radio frequencies

619
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:09,679
in the area with his little tiny home

620
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,390
grill with the right amount of ballasts

621
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,370
that's actually possible with the right

622
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,770
equipment in the right number of pieces

623
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,629
you can [ __ ] with radio frequencies a

624
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,548
little bit but you can't [ __ ] with no

625
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,910
people's cable right they're just trying

626
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:25,099
to face just cause sense it was the the

627
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,169
other person that was staying with me at

628
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:28,609
the time mentioned something about our

629
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,410
cable while the cop happened to be

630
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:32,869
standing in earshot and so he tried to

631
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,519
like use it as a in in with me like

632
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,489
Brody did a jerk next door that's

633
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,200
growing weed is poking up your TV it's

634
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,269
just nonsense trying to find a way to

635
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,150
your friend I know for a fact that dude

636
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,710
next door is 100% illegal cuz he showed

637
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,210
off his grow to me one night like super

638
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,850
proud of having finished building it and

639
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,798
like I high-fived him and like made sure

640
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:55,308
to wash my clothes right after cuz it

641
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:58,639
wasn't pro status but um it was small

642
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:03,109
and couldn't possibly fit one six plants

643
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,880
let alone exceed any sort of limit but

644
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,099
even in our little place there worried

645
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,929
about it and if it's not the cops that

646
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,279
notice that you're growing weed and are

647
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:13,280
interested in it it's the neighborhood

648
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:16,039
teenagers or the creepy biker dude up

649
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,569
the street like just you're gonna want

650
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,789
to think about all that stuff before you

651
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:23,480
go down this road because if you don't

652
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:25,369
that's where the really nasty problems

653
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,679
and headaches and black guys for the

654
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:29,479
community come in the duties throws 30

655
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,740
plants in his backyard stinks out the

656
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,569
neighborhood and ends up shooting one of

657
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,339
the local teenagers during harvest right

658
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,649
right this guy this guy's doing an

659
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,829
indoor girl you know who this just look

660
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,960
up the local laws

661
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:42,389
you know how to best protect yourself

662
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,360
and in what parameters you want to

663
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,620
operate under yes it's just a good good

664
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,178
another point to look up is oh it's

665
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,619
something that goes right along with the

666
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,240
type of nutrients you're gonna buy I

667
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,678
think the type of that shows you know

668
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,630
those the kind of person you are the

669
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,190
type of nutrients you buy the amount

670
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,778
yeah the amount of attention you pay to

671
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,308
the WHA that's all gonna reflect in your

672
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:01,589
garden and the type of person that you

673
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:03,089
are but all right let's focus back down

674
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,648
on here a little bit Mike wants you to

675
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,490
buy books and follow the rules a lot you

676
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,678
guys ah

677
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,048
I want to give a lot of credit to what

678
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,659
I'm talking about to a guy known as soma

679
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:14,278
soma is a cannabis breeder he's an old

680
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,960
hippie he's got some dreadlocks he wears

681
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:17,788
a bunch of crystals he's kind of a weird

682
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,829
dude I kind of used to look up to him

683
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:22,648
quite a bit he teaches us about a thing

684
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:24,629
called mimetics he says if there are 64

685
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:26,699
squares on the chess board and every one

686
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,590
of them is an opportunity to improve or

687
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,759
[ __ ] up your garden so think about where

688
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:31,288
you're putting your kings and queens on

689
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,599
the chessboard and play chess the best

690
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:34,980
that you can I'm a medics that's all the

691
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,298
things in your environment I did not

692
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,370
Google this word this is just from my

693
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,629
memory from what soma told me my medics

694
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,579
is all the things in your environment

695
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,769
combined every little detail that you

696
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,418
can see and cannot see can't control and

697
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:46,798
cannot control those are mimetics the

698
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,330
way that Mike is looking off into the

699
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,950
distance right now like he's confused

700
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,720
that is part of the mimetics of my

701
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,850
environment even though it doesn't

702
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,470
affect me it is still part of it somehow

703
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:57,269
it's the mimetics of this room the

704
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,798
airflow coming out of that duct that's

705
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,028
one of the things on my chessboard that

706
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,788
light coming from above that's one of

707
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:04,109
the things on my chessboard the window

708
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:05,069
open over there that's one of the parts

709
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,629
of my chess where those are all

710
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,638
affecting my environment in my

711
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,740
performance right now and every one of

712
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:13,349
those things has a very small impact the

713
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,028
dr. pepper the water the dad rig all of

714
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:16,619
those things have this bone right here

715
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:18,750
is distracting so all those things have

716
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:20,219
a few pieces of mimetics on my chest

717
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,288
where your plants have the same option

718
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,940
in the grow so every piece every piece

719
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:25,470
of dust in there as part of that grow

720
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,990
environment is affecting that plant in

721
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,940
some weird way so shout out to soma for

722
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,009
putting the mimetics idea into my head

723
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,980
that kind of put a lot of it opened up a

724
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,690
lot of stuff in my brain it's super

725
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,599
important I mean you're really creating

726
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,000
an artificial environment for a life in

727
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,949
the amount of little pieces that can

728
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,720
impact that in the environment you

729
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:51,090
create is just limitless how many times

730
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,450
have we stood in the same grow room

731
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,888
looking for new issues issues we haven't

732
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,669
seen before issues that have come up

733
00:26:55,888 --> 00:27:01,498
since the last cleaning and just knowing

734
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,440
what to look out for it takes a long

735
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:06,870
time to to be able to look into a space

736
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,240
and think okay if I'm gonna do a small

737
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:11,428
grow here these are the things that are

738
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,990
gonna be major issues here these are the

739
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,570
things I'm gonna need to upgrade or

740
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,870
purchase or this is the kind of size I

741
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:20,668
could get away with just taking the time

742
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:22,678
to understand what your parameters are

743
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,850
it's gonna help you out a lot like it's

744
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,048
hard to know where to put the pieces on

745
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,908
a chessboard if you don't know how to

746
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:28,109
play the game not sure that mimetics is

747
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,789
the word I'm looking for now that I'm

748
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:31,048
kind of looking at Wikipedia but shot it

749
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:33,720
to someone for teaching me a word I

750
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:36,089
[ __ ] forgot I could be Maddox this is

751
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,850
the Wikipedia for mimetics isn't really

752
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:41,548
not what I wanted one thing I wrote down

753
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:43,408
is you can't put turbos on an 86 Ford

754
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:44,999
Escort and expect to win a race if

755
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,769
you're gonna build a race car you got to

756
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,419
get a racing transmission you've got to

757
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,980
get yourself a racing steering wheel you

758
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,080
need a racing harness a lot of you

759
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,849
[ __ ] need a helmet I figured a

760
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,168
race you got to get all the racing gear

761
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,819
you can't just throw up some big lights

762
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,440
and think that that was the main point

763
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,089
of this question you can't just buy one

764
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,580
thing you've got to get it all correct

765
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:05,158
and if you've got a budget I would say

766
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:08,460
start with the lights then go nutrients

767
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,509
then work on the soil and then then

768
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,730
spend your budget where you can

769
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:14,069
otherwise don't just go best lights and

770
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,480
then shitty soil and shitty nutrients

771
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,259
you gotta kind of figure out where to

772
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,440
spread the spread

773
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,360
um we used to joke all the time that

774
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,879
there should be a cannabis Protective

775
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,378
Services people you could call to come

776
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:26,788
in and rescue plants that were

777
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:30,839
essentially being tortured to death by

778
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:33,538
morons and universally it was people who

779
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,308
loved cannabis wanted to produce their

780
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,319
own cannabis had a huge passion for

781
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:39,388
growing and not a single [ __ ] clue

782
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,638
about how to go about it

783
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:42,959
and did they they had you know a six

784
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:46,648
hundred dollar budget and went to the

785
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,200
grocer and bought a $580 light and then

786
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:51,868
a $2.00 watering can and a $3.00 pot and

787
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,278
said I got what I need they went home

788
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:55,470
they dug up some soil out of the

789
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,220
backyard in the pot they planted their

790
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,110
little plant

791
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,169
they stuck it under their giant light

792
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:04,038
and a 95 degree garage and shut the door

793
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:04,038
and called it a grow room

794
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,559
you see something like that and you feel

795
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,479
bad for the person because you know

796
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,429
there's they drop their whole nut on a

797
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,140
lot one piece of gear that's not useful

798
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,060
on its own and now you're running that

799
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,520
white it's just gonna cost and now

800
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,190
they're out the cost of that light every

801
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,309
month extra that's money that they could

802
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,720
be saving to buy the two pieces of gear

803
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:30,720
to make that one secure to the dudes

804
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,279
house and he had the LED light like 13

805
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,230
feet off the ground and that [ __ ]

806
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,700
plant he's like look how much this plant

807
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,769
is grown in the past couple days I was

808
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,450
like bro there's like a foot and a half

809
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,519
between node spacing that thing is not

810
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,980
growing that's called stretching and it

811
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:50,579
was in a pot the size of like a 1 liter

812
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:52,440
soda bottle yeah sorry I don't make fun

813
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,299
of that poor guy but if you would have

814
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,009
just thought about it and put that lot

815
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,119
the right light or put that light closer

816
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,839
to the plant he would add much more

817
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,399
success yeah I mean just where he was

818
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:04,259
playing video games is it a weed plant

819
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,630
next to him playing video games I can't

820
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:08,190
tell you how many people I've seen chain

821
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,980
smoking cigarettes in their grow room

822
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,930
because they heard somewhere that the

823
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,099
plants like extra carbon dioxide and

824
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,950
they heard somewhere that carbon dioxide

825
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:20,639
is something that comes off cigarettes

826
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:23,069
yummy and they take - technically true

827
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,020
pieces of information slam them together

828
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,389
in their head in a way that sort of

829
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,710
makes sense on surface and then they

830
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,420
can't figure out why their plants are

831
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,390
super sick it's like because you're

832
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,670
blowing that toxic smoke at them like

833
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:42,540
it's it's not good for oh you don't like

834
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:44,070
it I know so many people whose their the

835
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,720
big problem and they're Gro turned out

836
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:47,609
to be their dog likes to piss on their

837
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,470
plants oh that's awesome yeah I know who

838
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:50,729
that was I've seen it happiness three or

839
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,319
four people it happened to the one

840
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,710
[ __ ] dude you're thinking of like six

841
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,059
times but I mean some people are slower

842
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,740
learners because keep your pets and your

843
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,029
cigarettes out of your grow room a lot

844
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,500
of people like to take pictures of their

845
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:04,920
dogs and their cats in their grow room

846
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,869
but I think got bugs bro no matter how

847
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,370
clean he is but he's covered burgers got

848
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:10,019
bugs he's not [ __ ] in the yard he's

849
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,569
got some bugs on him don't let him in

850
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,819
the grow i barely let Mike in the grow

851
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:17,819
if you're in a gross if you're in a

852
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,609
bookstore or at a computer

853
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:24,000
first four grow books you see will cover

854
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:26,399
every issue we've brought up so far at

855
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,680
least enough to keep you from screwing

856
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,820
it up real bad fair yeah yeah yeah I was

857
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,950
just waiting for you to tie that around

858
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:37,049
to the dog walking in it's just some

859
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,900
sort of dog I mean dogs is one of those

860
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:41,190
things that every grow books gonna mesh

861
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,790
and keep your [ __ ] dog out of the

862
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,190
grower yeah

863
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:45,960
and so there's dogs in half the grow

864
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,430
rooms in America you see him in all the

865
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,950
people that post pictures their private

866
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,049
growing Instagram whatever my dog's name

867
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,759
is Bruno likes to hang out by the plants

868
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,649
I'm like yeah Bruno does he's [ __ ]

869
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,259
putting bugs and all kinds of [ __ ] on

870
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,530
your plants you guys that's a garden

871
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:03,210
that's a medical product you some of you

872
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,920
[ __ ] hippies would you don't have

873
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,900
your dog right by the food when you're

874
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:11,580
cooking but you do so I'm just gonna

875
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,860
stop all right it's there's no one thing

876
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:15,389
you can buy you got to do everything

877
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:16,949
with love everything with care the best

878
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,680
you can these plants start off with

879
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,850
potential to be 100 percent and as you

880
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,890
get in their way and you [ __ ] them up

881
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:24,329
you bring them down so if you give

882
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,830
everything you can the best you can

883
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:28,230
they'll come out 100 and then you'll do

884
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:29,819
it better next time you gotta learn one

885
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,529
thing I can recommend go trying to grow

886
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,450
17 different [ __ ] strains pick a

887
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:34,379
strain and grow it dial it in lock it in

888
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,120
nail it

889
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,770
get that one and get it going the right

890
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,000
way instead of trying to mess you can't

891
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,170
have seven girlfriend's you'll never

892
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,180
make them happy you can make one

893
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,550
girlfriend really really has a great

894
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,850
bucket analogy because each plant is

895
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:50,399
almost if not exactly as complicated as

896
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:52,529
a girlfriend it wants different things

897
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,640
at different times for different reasons

898
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:58,259
and if you've got a first-time grow you

899
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,680
don't want to be trying to make seven

900
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:04,109
different types of nutrients in in like

901
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,759
liter cup sizes you'll go and say you

902
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:07,500
wonder why is this OG Kush plant look

903
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,150
totally happy but this haze plant looks

904
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,619
like [ __ ] it's because you got a cal mag

905
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,570
deficiency because those plants want

906
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,369
completely [ __ ] different things then

907
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:15,629
you gonna learn how to mix nutrients for

908
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,219
two sides of the room and you're gonna

909
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,330
[ __ ] yourself it's gonna be hard or you

910
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,740
don't wanna plant that's trying to be

911
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,149
seven feet tall on one plant that's

912
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,920
trying to be 3 and a half feet tall yeah

913
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,540
or one plant that finishes in nine weeks

914
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,590
and one that finishes in seven and you

915
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,849
got to figure out how you're gonna you

916
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,959
just gotta start flushing over here and

917
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:31,209
cut down half the room and then

918
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,278
just sucks pick one strain run the [ __ ]

919
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,419
out of it that's my idea if you're an

920
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,250
experienced grower do whatever the [ __ ]

921
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,538
you want grow 32 strains in one room

922
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,159
make some flavors but if you're new and

923
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:41,679
you're trying to get you dialed in one

924
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,899
strains so much easier yeah all right I

925
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,649
hope I made a lot of sense because we

926
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:51,069
got real sidetracked yeah you can't put

927
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:53,829
turbos on an 86 escort and expect to win

928
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:55,599
races that was that was my favorite part

929
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:57,730
of that all right I've got a really cool

930
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:01,808
email from a guy who calls himself

931
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:04,120
arachnid death yeah

932
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:06,038
spider death does that mean that he is

933
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,858
the spider that kills or that he is

934
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:11,949
killed by spiders or the spider killer

935
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:12,398
he's a spider killer maybe arachnid

936
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,259
death

937
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,838
I expect another email I want to know

938
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,700
are you the spider killer enquiring

939
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:22,389
minds and [ __ ] bro were you killed by a

940
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:34,480
spider or you like maybe he's if it's

941
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:35,800
the second one away for a while let's

942
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,659
get to the emails his first things first

943
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,399
thank you so much for what you do I

944
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,240
wanted to take a moment and share some

945
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:42,219
stuff with you

946
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,348
I recently exited the military after

947
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,730
eight years of service I joined at 24

948
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,159
after being laid off from what I thought

949
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,780
would be the start of my lifetime career

950
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,480
after year of unemployment during the

951
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,919
economic downturn of 2008 I decided to

952
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,369
join the service to provide for my

953
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,348
family

954
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,150
before joining I thoroughly enjoyed

955
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:00,130
consuming cannabis on the rag in the

956
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,320
four months since my exit I've more than

957
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,420
enjoyed my eat-in trip my reintroduction

958
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,910
into cannabis however much has changed

959
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,070
in eight years dabs weren't a thing that

960
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:12,819
I'm aware of back then Alize not in

961
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,859
southern Ohio very I'm gonna say that

962
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,390
that was probably an uncommon kind of

963
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:20,259
pump the dabs were thing in southern

964
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:22,150
Ohio now yeah yeah he keeps going on he

965
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,670
says what advice would you give someone

966
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,769
like me I'm eager to try a DAB and I

967
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,420
have a friend willing to host me I don't

968
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:30,400
know what to expect for my first time

969
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,500
and I know it's different for everyone

970
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,910
but I was hoping you could try and

971
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,250
explain it to me I don't know how

972
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:38,079
significant it is my friend has a nectar

973
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,760
collector set up I'm currently only

974
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,348
going through a quarter ounce of

975
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,670
cannabis flower I'm going to assume he

976
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,920
says I'm only going through a quarter

977
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,778
every six weeks he's going through a

978
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,019
quarter ounce of flowers every six weeks

979
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:53,289
oh this guy's smoking around a gram a

980
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:55,868
week yeah so that's a buffer to a day

981
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:57,490
basically a one hit and quit each time I

982
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:00,880
smoked would you recommend that I

983
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:02,858
attempt to up my tolerance if so how I'm

984
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,510
a stay-at-home dad now so my smoking

985
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:06,909
really only occurs in the evenings when

986
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm not the sole care caregiver to a

987
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:11,288
toddler what are your thoughts man I've

988
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,880

another paragraph sorry I've got this on

993
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,298
multiple pages I thought I'd share my

994
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,588
what I listen to when I smoke

995
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:25,690
information with you because if you guys

996
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:26,798
remember on 4/20 I asked everybody to

997
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,630
tell me what they listened to when they

998
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,400
get stoned so he's gonna tell us about

999
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,470
his music interest it goes like this I'm

1000
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,150
a huge fan of music my tastes have grown

1001
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:35,348
to be more eclectic since high school

1002
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,970
my friends and I used to cruise around

1003
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:38,950
on my car and smoke and listen to

1004
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:43,449
Slipknot and similar occasionally

1005
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:45,278
pausing for an in-car mosh you were the

1006
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:46,598
other car in my high school I was in a

1007
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:48,429
different car than that we were there

1008
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,200
the deadheads in tie-dye a [ __ ] long

1009
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,909
hair we did not do the moshing I was

1010
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,949
kind of different-sized to the park yeah

1011
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,538
yeah the stoners prefer the Lodi's

1012
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:58,318
prefer the grassy knoll is what I think

1013
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:58,319
the line is from clueless

1014
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,900
I enjoy some rap and reggae I've been

1015
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:06,849
listening to the higher vibes playlist

1016
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,559
not Spotify and I dig it I created my

1017
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,750
own playlist with my favorites from it

1018
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,970

1019
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,858

1025
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:25,838
mystic roots been but I've heard on your

1026
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:28,629
show makes me think I'd like them

1027
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,130
overall so after my evening smoke sesh I

1028
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,048
like to grab my sketchbook and my

1029
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,329
headphones and listen to my Irie beats

1030
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:36,639
while sketching in my book I love being

1031
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:39,009
able to unwind with my pipe and art and

1032
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,108
letting the huge changes in my life melt

1033
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,730
into the background for a while on a

1034
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:45,338
recent episode you stated that

1035
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,440
recreational use is medical use I was

1036
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:49,599
unsure of my opinion until you made that

1037
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,759
statement you're totally right using

1038
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,650
this flower in any manner that lets you

1039
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:56,088
reduce stress or just generally enjoy

1040
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,209
your life more counts as medicinal you

1041
00:37:56,088 --> 00:38:01,369

1042
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,989

1046
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:12,048
thank you for sharing your experience

1048
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:16,998
that was difficult I hope it helped I

1049
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:18,619
hope it helped I know it helped me

1050
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,659
realize how seriously it can affect

1051
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:21,949
somebody's psyche and then he states

1052
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:25,548
that he's been in the military and he

1053
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:28,188
knows plenty of people with a TBI super

1054
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:30,528
common to people who serve in and around

1055

operation hide behind him until he gets

1075
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:26,359
shot like [ __ ] smoking weed would be

1076
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:27,978
on purpose to death by the drill

1077
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:38,538

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,838
to me and because I also know how vital

1082

1086
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,578

I appreciate the thank you uh message

1091
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,910
received let's see there's a lot to talk

1092
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:10,670
about here

1093
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:13,519
reintroduction to cannabis after [ __ ]

1094
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,139
eight years that's awesome I can only

1095
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,940
imagine what a eight year cannabis break

1096
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:18,529
would be like ah so it's a hell of a

1097
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,119
tolerance Brad he says what advice would

1098
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,130
you give somebody like me because he's

1099
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,509
eager to try a DAB he's got a friend

1100
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,710
that'll help him and he doesn't know

1101
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,920
what to expect

1102
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,389
ah let's try to explain to him a little

1103
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,579
bit about what he's gonna get from his

1104
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:33,500
first dab and then he also states that

1105
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:35,690
his buddies got a nectar collector I

1106
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,420
want to know is this nectar collector

1107
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:40,429
does it have water some of the nectar

1108
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,059
collectors don't have water some do I

1109
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:46,609
will in the hole the nectar collector

1110
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:48,199
period water no water it's harder to

1111
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,050
size you're hit that way if you're not

1112
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:54,469
careful true only set aside a very small

1113
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,760
part on so the nectar collector you heat

1114
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,179
it up and it just looks like a giant

1115
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,100
straw and it's got a hopefully a crystal

1116
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:02,989
a quartz crystal a glass or a titanium

1117
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,400
tip the three types of tips that I would

1118
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:05,000
hit off oh I wouldn't dam off of

1119
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,550
anything else

1120
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,719
glass quartz crystal or titanium there

1121
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,100
may be something else I'm not aware of

1122
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,989
but I don't think I dab off anything

1123
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:14,509
else hopefully it's got that hopefully

1124
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,219
it's got water I really hope your first

1125
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,520
dab comes through an apparatus that has

1126
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:21,319
got water without water a dad is hot as

1127
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,019
[ __ ] on your lungs part of the

1128
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,210
experience of a dad is the hint itself

1129
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,539
in your body in your lungs your physical

1130
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,039
reaction to that new smoke that new it's

1131
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:33,079
a different level of heat than what

1132
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,960
you're used to smoking this vapor is

1133
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:39,710
very very different than a smoke yes yes

1134
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,690
it feels heavy it feels sometimes he

1135
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,220
feels like some like someone just got

1136
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,980
their foot on your chest and you just

1137
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:48,230
you just can't breathe right last for a

1138
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,639
couple few seconds in my Jenny Beth says

1139
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,889
I can't say a couple of you anymore

1140
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,449
couple could be like a couple few could

1141
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:55,940
be anywhere between three to eight let's

1142
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:58,129
come right in a couple that's my thing

1143
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,539
but it only hurts for a couple few

1144
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,829
seconds like three to eight seconds

1145
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:03,139
we're gonna say it just feels like you

1146
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:05,599
might die but I find it pleasant it's

1147
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:07,579
like a whole but I like I kind of like

1148
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,619
that scary part of a dad he's a weird

1149
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,329
guy that eats insanely hot jalapenos and

1150
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,339
[ __ ] for entertainment I recommend you

1151
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:16,639
take a dab smaller than a piece of rice

1152
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,010
you want a very very small it's sort of

1153
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,098
like I like to think of it this way

1154
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,170
you're a beer drinker

1155
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,298
you've worked yourself up to going it

1156
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,548
out and having a 40 ounce beer after

1157
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:29,880
work chillin at the bar for an hour

1158
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:31,889
going home not intoxicated if you switch

1159
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,699
the hard liquor you don't start with the

1160
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:37,798
40 ounce month and that's what a lot of

1161
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,599
people try to try to do with their first

1162
00:42:37,798 --> 00:42:43,318
dab is they end up taking something

1163
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,640
that's like you fill the pint glass with

1164
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:47,068
vodka that was a bad idea

1165
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,449
yeah and their friends let them do it

1166
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:50,699
because they think it's funny and it's

1167
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:53,909
that makes people so not adapt you want

1168
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:55,920
a grain of rice or half a granary size a

1169
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:57,719
grain of rice is probably a big enough

1170
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,459
dad for your first try so you've got

1171
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,528
your nectar collector hopefully it's got

1172
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:03,598
water and don't suck so hard you get the

1173
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:05,639
water in your mouth give it a give it a

1174
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,778
test before you even heat it and start

1175
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,009
smoking through it put that nectar

1176
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:09,179
collector up to your mouth and pull

1177
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:12,389
through it and see what that experience

1178
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,818
is like feel that then have put the

1179
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,679
little half green of rice dab on

1180
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:18,690
whatever you're smoking off of I do not

1181
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,429
like smoking off of oil slick pads I do

1182
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,679
not like smoking out of silicone

1183
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:24,778
containers I like to put it on glass I

1184
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,118
put my dab on glass it's the only thing

1185
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:29,219
I [ __ ] trust for this I don't like

1186
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,838
the other [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm picky I

1187
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:32,489
don't want to smoke your silicone I

1188
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,259
don't want to burn [ __ ] with my [ __ ]

1189
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:37,469
nectar collector I don't like that so I

1190
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:38,909
highly recommend you put it on glass set

1191
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:40,798
your little dab on a piece of glass heat

1192
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:42,389
up your nectar collector touch the

1193
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:44,009
nectar collector to the dab and inhale

1194
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:45,298
kind of inhale right before you touch it

1195
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:47,880
as soon as it touches it's gonna

1196
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:50,338
vaporize take your little dab you only

1197
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,079
want that much smoke like it should

1198
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:56,608
sound like this like seriously that's

1199
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,769
probably enough smoke for your first dad

1200
00:43:56,608 --> 00:44:01,199
just a little you can always you can

1201
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:03,268
always smoke more but Ron white told joe

1202
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,099
rogan on a podcast one time he goes well

1203
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,838
you can't unsmoked that joint now Kenya

1204
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,630

1205
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,429
nonsense

1206
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,469
[ __ ] were you so you can't

1207
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,208
unsmoked dab but you can take another

1208
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:16,318
one and you're gonna want to so [ __ ]

1209
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,879
take the small ones if you take another

1210
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,159

1211
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,358
but I'm off track get a little half

1219
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:35,039

1220
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,900
but I was hoping you could try and

1221

1283
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,320
hot dab in your lungs a lot Jeff does a

1284
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,230
hot dab for a specific reason he takes a

1285
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,210
hot dad because he takes a huge dab and

1286
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:02,460
if the dab isn't hot enough at the

1287
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,470
beginning there's not enough heat there

1288
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,849
in the middle and end to properly give

1289
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:07,199
him the hit around its waist

1290
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:09,089
three-quarters of what I just threw in

1291
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,250
the nail and then it you end up q-tip in

1292
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,539
and a like a Maura I'm gonna a humble

1293
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,550
brag is what I think this might have

1294
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,769
been called back in the day what we just

1295
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,539
told this listener to smoke is half of a

1296
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:19,858
grain of rice for his first time and

1297
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:21,389
it's going to be effective it's not

1298
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,239
gonna leave him short of anything he'll

1299
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:25,199
be high from this arachnid death that

1300
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,459
you'll get high from this and if you

1301
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,509
don't smoke another one if you don't

1302
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,250
smoke another one like well dad hits you

1303
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,690
immediately so you'll know you like do I

1304
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,909
want another one or not and you'll know

1305
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,260
yes or no ah and then start playing

1306
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:38,579
games with yourself see how much of a

1307
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,740
dad you can take what I like to do with

1308
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:43,170
the nectar collector I will make a worm

1309
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:45,539
I'll take a long ass like a [ __ ]

1310
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,460
three or four inch worm of hash and lay

1311
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:48,960
it in the on the on whatever piece of

1312
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,250
glass I'm using and I will smoke the

1313
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,829
whole [ __ ] thing with the nectar

1314
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,690
collector like a goddamn ant eater

1315
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:56,309
sucking up a line of ants but what I was

1316
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,980
getting at is we just told this guy to

1317
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,639
smoke a piece of rice the dab I just put

1318
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:09,389
on this dabber

1319
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:11,069
that's probably 0.3 of a gram that's

1320
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:16,019
like a pointer finger nail tip it

1321
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:18,240
towards man you got big man hands it's a

1322
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:20,730
decent guys ring finger nail I'll give

1323
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,459
it a read three or four times thicker

1324
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,750
than anything I'm gonna take this tab

1325
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,760
here in just a second when Mike's talk

1326
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:28,469
talking and it's not gonna ruin me up

1327
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,940
hopefully not gonna cough it'll make my

1328
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:31,589
eyes the touch read for a few minutes

1329
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,500
this this kind of ties into another

1330
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:36,510
piece he mentions his what he listen to

1331
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,608
what he's listening to when he smokes

1332
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:42,030
and then says he hopes that's up to

1333
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:44,009
snuff and when I read that the first

1334
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,380
thing that hit me was bro it's it's

1335
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:49,109
music do you like oh well the only

1336
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:52,019
person who gets to decide if it's up to

1337
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:53,838
snuff is you yes and with the with the

1338
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:56,179
dab size

1339
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,650
but people have this weird competition

1340
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:59,478
thing that they do with everything

1341
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,108
you're gonna eat one doughnut I'm gonna

1342
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,759
eat too

1343
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:03,858
you're gonna hit on one chick I'm gonna

1344
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:06,438
hit on two you're gonna take one Deb I'm

1345
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:11,239
gonna take two please don't do that with

1346
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:13,938
hash I got it marijuana is totally fun

1347
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:16,818
until you weigh over do it um and if you

1348
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:18,078
just kind of go easy and figure out

1349
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:20,420
where your limits are a little bit

1350
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,680
you're gonna have such a better time

1351
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,829
remember the do we having to call his

1352
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,389
wife to come pick his ass up remember

1353
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:27,589
the cop that had to call 9-1-1 because

1354
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:30,679
he was too high and thought he was dying

1355
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:33,139
he was dying it happens people end up

1356
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,578
don't put a space between those

1357
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,808
sentences because we just said the guy

1358
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:37,489
that called 911 cause you thought he was

1359
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:39,109
dying then you said it happens people do

1360
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:41,028
not die from cannabis that's a pause

1361
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:43,458
can't die from consuming too much weed

1362
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:46,909
but you can make yourself miserable by

1363
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:48,739
consuming consuming too much weed in the

1364
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:50,958
legalization stage there was a big bump

1365
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:53,059
and people calling poison control and

1366
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:54,948
then showing up at the ers for just

1367
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:55,569
having way over consumed not paying

1368
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:58,338
attention

1369
00:49:55,568 --> 00:50:00,139
typically with edibles people [ __ ]

1370
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:03,409
hate adult hate reading labels we don't

1371
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:05,298
real Able's for [ __ ] and so a lot of

1372
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:06,920
people way over consumed edibles and

1373
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:08,778
ended up in the hospital the first time

1374
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,039
they ate edibles in Colorado or

1375
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:12,048
Washington just because they never read

1376
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,160
the label and if you just take the

1377
00:50:12,048 --> 00:50:16,849
little dev and see where you're at

1378
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:18,078
you're gonna have a great time if you if

1379
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:20,449
you look at your friend that's a regular

1380
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,739
dabber and try to mimic their

1381
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:24,349
consumption level you're gonna have a

1382
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:25,849
miserable [ __ ] time maybe maybe he's

1383
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:27,798
gonna [ __ ] love it that could be like

1384
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,449
me I'm a savage and I love just crossing

1385
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:33,108
that threshold pretty much everyone I

1386
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:35,630
know has a type of alcoholic beverage

1387
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:38,838
that they can't even think about yeah

1388
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,539
they they start to say whiskey sour or

1389
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,038
whatever it is for that it's Jose Cuervo

1390
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:45,709
their nose starts running a little under

1391
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,709
their throat and their start tongue

1392
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:50,118
starts getting real thick and dry and

1393
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:52,009
everyone has that because when you were

1394
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,559
first learning to consume alcohol you

1395
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:58,130
way overdid it with whatever product um

1396
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,289
and if you can just avoid doing that to

1397
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,329
yourself with hash you don't ever have

1398
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:04,130
to be the guy that has to yeah the first

1399
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:05,769
time I took a DAB I pooped myself and

1400
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,480
fell asleep on Jerry's couch I do

1401
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:09,670
put too much of a dab in the rig for

1402
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,440
myself so I just tag team buddy past the

1403
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:23,530
leftover dad - Mike that's why he cut

1404
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:24,760
out team work I'm gonna turn Mike's mic

1405
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,340
down for just a minute bro when you're

1406
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,270
ready give me a thumbs up

1407
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,559
who was it trying to be rude and kill

1408
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:30,940
him you guys that was kind of a bigger

1409
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:32,590
dad than Mike needed he's got a thumbs

1410
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,570
down he just there's two thumbs down

1411
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,640
like do not [ __ ] with my microphone I

1412
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,809
would ask Mike a question he can listen

1413
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:42,940
but it's gonna be a minute before he

1414
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:46,150
replies our listener says I smoke one

1415
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,090
hit each time and I quit because he's

1416
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:52,570
gay I'm pretty sure he's plenty high can

1417
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:55,539
we quantify what a DAB is going to do to

1418
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:57,570
him like how many hits do you think a

1419
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:59,949
dab equals if he takes one hit at a time

1420
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,289
how many hits do you think it would take

1421
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:06,549
to get to a small dab would you say

1422
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:07,929
three you just showed me six so six hits

1423
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,280
off of your pipe you're gonna have to

1424
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:10,839
work your way up to six it's off your

1425
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,940
pipe to achieve what you get with one

1426
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:17,620
dad ish ish okay I would almost agree

1427
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,510
with that I'd say yeah I said 5 was my

1428
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:23,170
first guess I was gonna say 5 or 10 and

1429
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:25,000
you gave me 6 so yeah and then just

1430
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,260
imagine that you're gonna be 6 times

1431
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,820
higher when you take a DAB you're gonna

1432
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,380
be 6 times higher than when you smoked

1433
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,820
that one hit a weed that you smoke and

1434
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,230
we don't know what kind of weed you're

1435
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,480
smoking are you smoking high grade we'd

1436
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:36,159
be smoking Mexican brick weed if you're

1437
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,320
smoking Mexican brick weed and you step

1438
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,799
up to a dad it's going to be a game

1439
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,870
[ __ ] changer one thing to mention the

1440
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,030
dabs will ruin your tolerance for weed

1441
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:48,219
if you start regularly can for sure yeah

1442
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,930
I don't I can smoke all the joints if

1443
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:52,629
you've got joints I'll smoke them all

1444
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:53,859
like bring them and we'll smoke them all

1445
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,599
get cottonmouth and I'll get a sore

1446
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,599
throat eventually but I won't get stoned

1447
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:06,009
but I have to be really careful with my

1448
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:08,860
hash consumption or I'll ruin flowers

1449
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:10,510
for myself for a while yeah and I fixed

1450
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,400
that with just a quick little vacation I

1451
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,840
like to smoke flowers at concerts and

1452
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,119
stuff and I smoke a lot of flowers

1453
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,740
flowers still my favorite way to go it's

1454
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,338
flowers in a bong it's the way it all

1455
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,838
started flowers in a bong

1456
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:22,818
I was smoking flowers in a bong a little

1457
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:26,150
while back I'm old man my lungs don't

1458
00:53:22,818 --> 00:53:28,009
work anymore that's hard it's funny my

1459
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,749
lungs like the bong hit a lot more than

1460
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:32,150
they like the davit I could tell and

1461
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:34,818
it's because I'm a smoker my lungs have

1462
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,559
been trained for 20 years if you tell

1463
00:53:34,818 --> 00:53:37,969
this guy to expect coughing did we

1464
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,709
mention that you're gonna go off

1465
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:42,380
uncomfortable you just heard might cough

1466
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:43,969
for a long time you throats designed to

1467
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,509
prevent you from doing what you're

1468
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:49,548
trying to do with it if you are a smoker

1469
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:51,858
it's going to increase your coffee you

1470
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:53,358
notice I don't cough my dad my friend

1471
00:53:51,858 --> 00:53:54,949
Elijah he doesn't cop when he dad

1472
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,420
we don't smoke cigarettes Mike and James

1473
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:58,009
they cough like sons of [ __ ] when

1474
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,259
they dad and they both Bryant caught

1475
00:53:58,009 --> 00:54:01,909
it's you guys all smoked cigarettes I

1476
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:06,699
can feel it because it's not just when I

1477
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:10,338
dab when I hit a vape of any kind even

1478
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:12,829
the little oil sticker or whatever hash

1479
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:15,349
cartridges when I hit one of those or

1480
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:16,849
nicotine vape or even one of the little

1481
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:19,009
electronic cigarettes that you get at

1482
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:22,809
the gas stations rattles ooh sure I feel

1483
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:25,728
the same pressure or burn or tightness

1484
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:27,859
that I that causes the cough when I dab

1485
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:30,468
it's the heated liquid vapor versus a

1486
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:32,420
smoke just jar and loose all your tar

1487
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:34,759
lung it's totally different

1488
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,249
it's like water and air going through a

1489
00:54:34,759 --> 00:54:38,929
hose but this dude asked would you

1490
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:42,288
recommend that I attempt to up my

1491
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:43,248
tolerance and if so how I would not at

1492
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:44,749
all recommend that

1493
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:48,738
yeah you're a cheap date stay that way

1494
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:51,798
right like I can recommend you spend

1495
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:53,358
more on dinners too right now it doesn't

1496
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:55,548
cost you a lot to get high it's easier

1497
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:58,788
to conceal you could wear more expensive

1498
00:54:55,548 --> 00:55:01,159
shoes there's just there's no reason to

1499
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:03,079
push your tolerance further up when you

1500
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:05,088
start dabbing it's going to do it itself

1501
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:07,068
so don't dab too frequently and then

1502
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:09,139
just keep your stash of don't buy dabs

1503
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:10,670
maybe only down only dab when your buddy

1504
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,558
dabs you know which is dick move but I

1505
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,088
mean if you don't buy it then you don't

1506
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,329
have it there to just become a dad head

1507
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:18,768
you're not always dabbing I'm just kind

1508
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:20,359
of enjoying the thought of what it would

1509
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:22,739
be like to be able to get to where I'd

1510
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,719
want to be after a hit or two

1511
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,729
like how much cheaper that would be how

1512
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:27,779
much how much time I would save that way

1513
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,929
yeah

1514
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:33,359
like even when I'm dab in because I'm a

1515
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:36,029
smoker and my lungs can't handle giant

1516
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,409
dabs I've got to sit down and take three

1517
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,880
or four which means I've got to eat the

1518
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:40,769
nail three or four times wait for the

1519
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,410
diver to cool three or four times get

1520
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:44,820
distracted three or four times and all

1521
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:47,519
of a sudden hour and a half's gone by

1522
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,710
and I've gotten baked once like if I

1523
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:53,519
could take a puff be fried and be back

1524
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:56,159
to doing whatever it was yeah that would

1525
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,909
be preferable that's my take one giant

1526
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:01,588
dad there's something happens something

1527
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:03,569
happens to me when I take one big

1528
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:05,759
gigantic dab it doesn't happen when I

1529
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,400
take six or seven little tiny dad's it

1530
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,960
just doesn't do it one big dad really

1531
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,019
just just does it for me

1532
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,550
it uh it's different for everybody and

1533
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,679
honestly with cannabis there's so many

1534
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,910
different ways to consume it just

1535
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:20,699
playing with the different ones of

1536
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:22,529
finding your favorite that's a little

1537
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,329
harder where you are versus where we are

1538
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:27,540
true but true

1539
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:28,500
ah dude I was gonna say that's why I got

1540
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:30,949
a little quiet I should remember what

1541
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,329
the [ __ ] is gonna say do you notice that

1542
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:35,819
back in the day when you smoked and went

1543
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:37,559
to work not to say that we might take

1544
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,530
dabs and go to work now I never did that

1545
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,880
I can't answer this question okay you

1546
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,230
don't have these jobs anymore you don't

1547
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,910
[ __ ] work there so [ __ ] those places

1548
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,740
when you worked in places before when

1549
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:49,139
you weren't allowed to smoke when you

1550
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:51,868
walked in there did you just feel [ __ ]

1551
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:53,969
super high like like I'm not supposed to

1552
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:57,510
be high at work I'm really high suddenly

1553
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:59,459
and now that it's okay to show up for

1554
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:01,619
work medicated so that you're not in

1555
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,929
pain and nobody judges you and nobody

1556
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:08,970
cares does it affect your level of

1557
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:11,579
Highness or medication this it affects

1558
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:17,730
my anxiety level around it okay yeah I

1559
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:20,069
think that's to be honest because I'm in

1560
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:23,099
a fire I'm in an environment where I can

1561
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,570
be honest with my boss that I took this

1562
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,820
cannabis product or that cannabis

1563
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:29,700
product this morning well I'm working a

1564
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:33,390
full shift to do my job as expected I am

1565
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,809
go home everybody's fine nobody gives a

1566
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:36,568
[ __ ]

1567
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:40,380
I find myself

1568
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:45,409
more concerned with making sure it's

1569
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:48,630
never an issue okay I would feel worse

1570
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:51,058
being too baked to do what I needed to

1571
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,410
do now then I would have at the coats

1572
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,910
more when I was 18

1573
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:55,978
all right does that make sense yeah no

1574
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:57,778
I'm kind of the same way I won the boss

1575
00:57:55,978 --> 00:58:00,659
so I make sure not to get [ __ ] blown

1576
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:03,059
out baked right like yeah I still pay

1577
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:05,068
more attention and like yeah they like

1578
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,229
they don't get mad and as they know if

1579
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:09,599
they know that we're smoking nobody said

1580
00:58:07,228 --> 00:58:11,968
anything I don't know he's not gonna

1581
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,380
call this out on it and so like they

1582
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:15,958
know that we're all medical marijuana

1583
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,669
patients so like we work hard and

1584
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:19,768
nobody's calling us out for not having

1585
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:21,598
sore knees and so I make sure not to

1586
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:23,818
just be ripped when I show up or so

1587
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,219
right like what we do is body intensive

1588
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,409
to being able to do it for eight hours a

1589
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:30,449
day five days a week I deal with all the

1590
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:34,078
contractors and the city people so I

1591
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:35,539
can't be blown represent our company all

1592
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,509
hey bro

1593
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:40,919
trying to be bright-eyed wide-eyed

1594
00:58:38,509 --> 00:58:42,119
mostly ready to rock my favorites when

1595
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:44,038
I've been in a grow and I'm like balls

1596
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,298
deep in a project and a contractor rings

1597
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,278
a doorbell and I answered the door like

people who work with it while there is

1650
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:35,550
fined like shopping for groceries or

1651

going about their life or taking money

1652
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:41,160
to the bank and how is sort of chuckle

1653
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:43,050

1752
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,039
earlier dude I was a teenager and I was

1753
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:18,958
into Metallica I got in

1754
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,880
Pantera I dabbled in the like the

1755
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:22,918
Cannibal Corpse deicide type of [ __ ] for

1756
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,759
a minute and then when I started heavily

1757
01:04:22,918 --> 01:04:28,528
smoking cannabis my music tastes changed

1758
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:30,838
drastically I started The Nine Inch

1759
01:04:28,528 --> 01:04:32,668
Nails Primus sort of thing and then I

1760
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:35,639
went to a REM concert and I thought it

1761
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:38,129
was a huge REM fan and then happen to

1762
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:39,900
most people a lot of different stuff you

1763
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:43,259
went 3:11 route is there out mic went

1764
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,789
and then yeah my first 311 shows from

1765
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:46,498
life I'd listen to the Grateful Dead

1766
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:47,819
sporadically but my friend Greg

1767
01:04:46,498 --> 01:04:49,468
introduced me to the Grateful Dead and

1768
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:51,418
then he took me to a Phish show at Red

1769
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:53,068
Rocks and all hell broke loose that's

1770
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:55,650
how that happened so I never got into

1771
01:04:53,068 --> 01:04:57,929
the heavy stuff this is funny all right

1772
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:00,778
before I found 3:11 in my life changed

1773
01:04:57,929 --> 01:05:03,709
forever the CD that I was most hyped to

1774
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:05,699

1775
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:07,889

1776
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:10,438

1777
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:12,719

used to think you had to go real hot

1865

1869
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:20,068

great points in and honestly when I go

1970
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:02,109
back and listen to shows the ones with

1971
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:05,409
listener generated content where

1972
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:07,210
somebody has a specific question those

1973
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:09,578
tend to be the shows that I find myself

1974
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:12,239
really getting into a third I'm cool a

1975

1978
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:21,069
Pandora for so many hours a day and so I

1979
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:23,199
end up going through podcasts and I'll

1980
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:26,078
burn through an entire run of a podcast

1981
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,939
nice nice I think I'm listening to too

1982
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:29,828

1983
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:30,908
when you're going 18 hours a day there's

1984
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:32,349
always something playing in the

1985
01:12:30,908 --> 01:12:34,808
background you just burn through a lot

1986
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:36,309

2000
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,479
internet company who used to [ __ ] me

2001
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:08,039
with that particular trick and so I feel

2002
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,899
for people who have to deal with data

2003
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:12,569
stuff like that but yeah be careful

2004
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:14,399
which episode you download yes three

2005
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:16,199

2007
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:21,630
saved them as a smaller file they're not

2008
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:24,090
as high-quality so they're the same size

2009
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:27,210
file as a short episode because they're

2010
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:31,079
not saved as a Apple enhanced podcast

2011
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:32,609
