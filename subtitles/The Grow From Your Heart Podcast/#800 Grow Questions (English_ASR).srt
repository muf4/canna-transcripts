00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,918
let's move off of the ramblings and

122
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,500
business part of the podcast let's jump

123
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,358
into some grow topics I was talking to a

124
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,160
friend earlier today and we're talking

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,918
about just rebuilding Grow rooms and

126
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,479
designing spaces and ideas and goals and

127
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,180
then every time we talk about adding

128
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,879
more [ __ ] to a grow my brain says keep

129
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,978
it simple Stoner the more [ __ ] in that

130
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,560
room the more operating pieces you've

131
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,939
got the more [ __ ] can go wrong I work in

132
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,680
commercial facilities

133
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,079
I train people to work in commercial

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,699
facilities when we have a new hire the

135
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,740
first thing I tell them so I have them

136
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,660
meet me at the door to the facility on

137
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,160
day one I unlock the door we walk in

138
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,139
together we clock in together I teach

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
this person how to run the grow they

140
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,800
walk in right with me before we walk

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,960
into the grow on the very first day I

142
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,600
tell them the first thing we are going

143
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,698
to look for today is to find out what

144
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,400
broke last night and I know that sounds

145
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,960
uh very not very optimistic but when you

146
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,179
run a commercial facility with somewhere

147
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,219
between two and 500 lights or maybe even

148
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,259
more in some cases there are a lot of

149
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,560
lights a lot of fans a lot of pumps a

150
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,479
lot of random equipment humidifiers

151
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,240
dehumidifiers uh cameras sensors

152
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,500
detectors emitters there's a ton of [ __ ]

153
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,538
that can go wrong and guess what

154
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,279
something is going to go wrong no matter

155
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,439
how much maintenance you do no matter

156
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,939
how much care and upkeep you give these

157
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,860
are constantly moving pieces in a

158
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,538
commercial facility something will go

159
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,340
wrong the first thing you need to do

160
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,560
when you go in I teach is go look for

161
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,359
the [ __ ] that broke so my theory is the

162
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,879
less moving Parts you have in a personal

163
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,400
grow the less [ __ ] you've got to break

164
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,839
so kind of keep it simple Stoner another

165
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,478
thing that reminds me of and brings me

166
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,879
to is when I started growing we did not

167
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,519
have all these monitors and devices and

168
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,199
technology and toys I had to learn the

169
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,418
plants the plants are what was telling

170
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,038
me I'm over watered I'm under watered

171
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:00,959
it's too hot in here it's too cold in

172
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,180
here you've given me too much nitrogen

173
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,279
you haven't given me enough nitrogen the

174
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,500
plants are what I have learned as my

175
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,179
monitors my meters I don't use a bunch

176
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,519
of technical stuff in my grow space I

177
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,959
have a pH pen I have an EC meter I've

178
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,219
got monitors to tell me what the

179
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,198
temperature and humidity are in there

180
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,720
but I don't really use a lot of super

181
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,978
overly complicated technical [ __ ] if I

182
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,020
need to know if it's too hot or too cold

183
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,339
in my grow I look at the thermometer if

184
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,198
I need to know if the humidity is too

185
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,758
high or too low I look at the hygrometer

186
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,919
those are two really easy pieces of

187
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,300
equipment to read that tell me what my

188
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:31,620
room is sitting at the temperature and

189
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
humidity those are two of the most

190
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,100
important things if those are cool then

191
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,840
I look at the plants if the plants look

192
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,460
like this and they're green nothing to

193
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,959
[ __ ] with if they're yellow if they're

194
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,638
going side sideways if the leaves are

195
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,739
twisting there's something to deal with

196
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,538
and guess what those leaves are telling

197
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,038
me exactly what the problem is I look at

198
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,719
the leaf I go it's kind of yellow in the

199
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,680
middle it needs some nitrogen or I look

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
at the leaf and I go oh it's getting

201
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,160
crispy at the tips I'm feeding it a

202
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,720
little bit too much I can identify all

203
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,699
of those problems so what I'm kind of

204
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,319
getting at is you guys don't rely on so

205
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,600
much of that equipment keep it simple

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,220
Stoner learn the plants learn how to

207
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,500
identify what the plants are telling you

208
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,600
learn how to identify it early and how

209
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,038
to react to it if you see this how do

210
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,080
you respond to it to correct that

211
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,060
because another thing once you identify

212
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,879
the problem how are you going to correct

213
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,860
it many new Growers see a very small

214
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,959
problem and they turn it into a big

215
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,879
problem by trying to over correct that

216
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,439
problem they say oh I need a little bit

217
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,240
of Cal Mag but I read that when you give

218
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,339
Cal Mag you need to give phosphorus or

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,478
potassium or also maybe I should add

220
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,579
some of this and they just get these

221
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,978
bright ideas what if I put this in there

222
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,139
also guess what you had a Cal Mag

223
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:35,459
deficiency add a little bit of Cal Mag

224
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,139
it was probably calcium and not

225
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,579
magnesium but they're sold in the same

226
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,379
bottle so you see what I'm saying you

227
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,060
see that little bit of a problem and you

228
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,860
want to fix 12 different problems or

229
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,180
throw 12 different things at it and then

230
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,400
you throw everything out of whack just

231
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,620
carefully fix that one problem what I'm

232
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,839
rambling about is you guys learn the

233
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,180
plants keep it simple Stoner don't rely

234
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,399
too much on monitors equipment Gear toys

235
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,379
tools and Technology when we've been

236
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,120
doing this for hundreds of years growing

237
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,620
plants without all that [ __ ] we've just

238
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,000
been looking at them and going hey Bill

239
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,519
this plant's yellow what should we do

240
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,199
give it more nitrogen perfect it's been

241
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,418
it's been that simple for that long so

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,740
let's learn these plants there are

243
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,418
plenty of charts on the internet that

244
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,978
will tell you if your leaves look like

245
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,299
this here is the problem if your leaf

246
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,399
looks like this here is the problem

247
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,199
those charts are quite accurate if you

248
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,179
learn how to read them and become very

249
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,860
Discerning because of course a couple of

250
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,660
them look similar and can be confusing

251
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,939
but really pay attention to the details

252
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,919
and pay attention to what you fed also

253
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,240
and you'll know did I give it too much

254
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,218
nitrogen did I not give it enough

255
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,899
phosphorus you'll be able to tell based

256
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,640
on what the leaves are doing and what

257
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,019
you have fed that plant so that's how I

258
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,120
wrap up that section where I call it

259
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,559
keep it simple Stoner let's not not

260
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,299
focus so much on the toys and the

261
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,098
technology but let's learn how to pay

262
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,559
attention to the plants because after

263
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,360
all the plants are the boss in our Grow

264
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,919
rooms all right now let's segue into

265
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,959
everybody's favorite part of this

266
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,360
podcast let's get into the email portion

questions here in front of me this first

269
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,279
question did come from the grow help

270
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,899
submission tab on iregenetics.com if you

271
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,778
have a grow help question go to my

272
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,399
website irygenetics.com there's a row of

273
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,740
tabs at the top one of them says grow

274
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,059
help or grow questions click on that tab

275
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,980
we'll give you the opportunity to fill

276

here on the podcast guess what you win a

280
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,379
free pack of seeds so this message came

281
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,120
from my friend chivo Del Norte big shout

282
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,220
out to chivo you have won a free pack of

283
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,080
irie genetic seeds please send me an

284
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,180
email with your shipping address and

285
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,800
also include a real name that I can put

286
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,958
on the box for those seeds because I

287
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,639
have to hand deliver these packages to

288
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,619
the post office and when they see where

289
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,539
weird random names they look at me kind

290
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,919
of funny and I don't want any problems

291
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,439
let's put a real name on the package

292
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,599
please you guys this grow question goes

293
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,279

that much respect back at you as well

312
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,899
big fist bump now it says my question is

313
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,338
in the area of white hairs those are

314
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,440
called pistols my friend those are the

315
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,120
reproductive organ of the plant it says

316
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,160
is there a way to tell from the hairs

317
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
that the plant has been pollinated I

318
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,240
know some cultivars do produce red hairs

319
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
so I was wondering how I can tell the

320
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,440
difference thanks again for your time

321
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,578
and passion and Aloha big Aloha my

322
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,240
brother thank you for the great question

323
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:51,239
let's talk about these pistols about 14

324
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,039
to 21 to 28 to 32-ish days into flower

325
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,200
your plant is going to be showing

326
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,939
pistols those are the dandelion looking

327
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,160
or the cluster of those pistols looks

328
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,079
like a dandelion forming on your ganja

329
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,000
plant that is the start of flower those

330
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,219
little pistols are the reproductive part

331
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,379
of the cannabis plant cannabis is number

332
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,300
one goal we think it's to get us High

333
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:10,860
that's that's the bonus that's the side

334
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,379
effect but the number one goal of the

335
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,600
cannabis plant is to reproduce it wants

336
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,000
to make more plants to continue its life

337
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,740
next year and then continue next year so

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,078
cannabis's number one goal is to

339
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,940
reproduce and those white hairs are the

340
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,458
reproductive organ on the plant those

341
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,660
hairs stick out the male plants grow a

342
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,879
little bit taller than the females

343
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,100
hopefully they drop pollen that pollen

344
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,259
lands on that uh that hair that pistol

345
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,940
slides down that pistol into the ovule

346
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,200
where a seed is formed there's a brat

347
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,240
involved in there but we're just going

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,680
to stick with the ovule into the a Brack

349
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,139
to see this form that's where the seeds

350
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,939
will happen now the question is how can

351
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,439
I tell if the plant has been pollinated

352
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,779
by looking at the pistols that's a

353
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,240
really good question once the plant is

354
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,620
pollinated so we'll say the pistols are

355
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
sticking up like my fingers like I'm

356
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,519
giving you a high five

357
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,379
shortly after pollination they'll turn

358
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,360
kind of a brown color and start to

359
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,519
crumple inside on themselves and just

360
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,139
dry up and wither away that's how to

361
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,419
identify that they have been pollinated

362
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,000
now it is true that a lot of plants do

363
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,039
produce red hairs but that is later in

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,839
flour once those hairs have turned red

365
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,879
that plant has basically passed its

366
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,620
prime point for pollination and it can

367
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,720
no longer receive pollen its lady parts

368
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,360
are dried up basically and it can no

369
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,860
longer reproduce now most of the time I

370
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,899
can tell the difference between a dried

371
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,820
up pistol that has been pollinated and a

372
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,440
plant that has gone beyond its time just

373
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,180
by kind of looking at the plant first of

374
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,100
all there will be a seed if it's been

375
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,379
pollinated it will start forming a seed

376
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,120
I won't take very long from pollination

377
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,159
for the seeds to start forming you'll

378
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,139
see seeds in seven to ten days they

379
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,639
won't be chunky fat healthy seeds but

380
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,259
you'll be able to identify that that

381
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,360
plant has been pollinated by the

382
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,519
formation of seeds now when they get

383
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,500
pollinated they kind of curl in and

384
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,179
shrivel a little bit differently if they

385
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,039
go unpollinated and they're left just to

386
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,379
die on their own and wither away they

387
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,519
kind of just die and stay not withered

388
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,078
and curled in but a little bit

389
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,179
straighter they do have curls and

390
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,739
textures to them but they don't curl as

391
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,778
badly I keep saying the word curl maybe

392
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,519
that's exactly what to look for when it

393
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,439
like claws up a little bit when the

394
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,179
pistols they just fold in on each other

395
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
that's when they have been pollinated if

396
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,719
they're still kind of long and wispy

397
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,399
like eyelashes then they're probably not

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,680
pollinated but the number one indicator

399
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,360
obviously is going to be the presence of

400
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,799
a seed in that plant now a lot of people

401
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,019
are going to freak out

402
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,879
a lot of times people send me messages

403
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,740
they say hey bro what do I do my plants

404
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,419
are filled with seeds and then I say

405
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,759
let's investigate more send me a picture

406
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,199
send me a video let's do some tricks we

407
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,120
go squeezing around on the plant we go

408
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,160
looking around and we realize those are

409
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,379
not seeds those are swollen bracks which

410
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,719
is what we want we want the plant to get

411
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,740
swollen calyxes big fat brats those are

412
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,720
the parts that we're going to smoke

413
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,700
that's going to be the flour that is the

414
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,920
flower cluster forming every one of

415
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,139
those little clusters makes a big flower

416
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,759
so we want that to happen a lot of

417
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,680
people freak out they see it the nodes

418
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,819
right where the leaf the big petiole

419
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,138
comes out sometimes there's a little

420
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,000
Brack right at the bottom of there

421
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,980
people really freak out and say I've got

422
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,500
seeds guess what that's just a brat you

423
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,600
probably don't have seeds so look at the

424
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,519
plants and you can tell if they're big

425
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
and white and fluffy those are ready for

426
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,179
pollen and have not been pollinated if

427
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,278
they get brown and curl in a little bit

428
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,838
like a cat Clyde yes or like the like

429
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,578
the yeah it's a cat climb making right

430
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,899
there bro that's what that is they curl

431
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:17,699
in like a girl on Instagram trying to

432
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,500
show you her fingernails if they curl in

433
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,879
like that that makes sense right then

434
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,919
it's probably probably been pollinated

435
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,299
if they just die and lay across the bud

436
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,278
like that and they don't curl in like

437
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,899
the cat claw then they're probably just

438
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,039
expired pistols is what I would call

439
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,019
them at that point I just made that

440
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,759
phrase up expired pistols I don't know

441
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,019
if that's even real you heard it first

442
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,059
turn on the grow from your heart podcast

443
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,820
episode 800 we're making up new [ __ ]

444
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,198
words have fun with me um so I think I

445
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,839
basically covered that I know some

446
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,838
cultivar cultivars produce red hairs

447
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,399
that's going to be later than flour so

448
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,019
um you'll know you'll you'll probably

449
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,519
you should probably be able to tell the

450
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,560
difference if you don't see any seeds or

451
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,820
anything then it has not been pollinated

452
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,619
so just go ahead and give it a squeeze

453
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,120
don't go destroying your buds but give

454
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,879
it a squeeze if there's a seed in there

455
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,620
it'll pop like a pea or it'll have some

456
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,379
juices inside of it if there's not a

457
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,600
seed there won't be anything inside of

458
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:07,799
those bracks or calyx is all right my

459
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,959
buddy chivo thank you for the great

460
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,958
message I do owe you a free pack of irie

461
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,939
genetic seeds once again please do send

462
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,219
me your shipping info I'll get those out

463
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,360
to you right away if I do owe you seeds

464
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,740
as a prize because I've read your

465
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,959
message here on the show and I have not

466
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,120
sent it please be patient with me I was

467
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,919
overwhelmed with the 420 sale I've just

468
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,240
caught up with all of that got a lot of

469
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,399
stuff going on but I will get your

470
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,620
prizes out have no fear uh everybody

472
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,379
takes a little bit of time all right

473
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,379
we're going to move into the next

474
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,720
question here on today's podcast this

475
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,899
one came from our friend cronker as how

476
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,820
I think I would say that

477
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,078
k-r-o-n-k-o-r that's cronker that's what

478
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm calling you from now on but I hope

479
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,219
that's how I say it so this message says

480
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,519
yo Rasta Jeff I love your show and I've

481
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,199
been watching since at least

482
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,820
2018. that's a lot of episodes bro thank

483
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,439
you for watching also kind of

484
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,180
embarrassing because I wasn't a super

485
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,040
good podcaster back then but thank you

486
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,479
for growing with me I hope you notice

487
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,799
the growth and improvements in the

488
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,139
podcast I hope you're watching the video

489
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,639
as well uh then it goes on it says thank

490
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,919
you for all of the wonderful information

491
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,079
you put into your podcast I have learned

492
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,698
a law like I said before bro that is the

493
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,559
kind of feedback and encouragement that

494
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:19,259
I need to keep me inspired to do the

495
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,819
shows so thank you it says now on to my

496
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,980
reason for writing I have a few

497
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,440
potential questions for you to maybe

498
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,240
answer on your podcast have no fear my

499
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,459
dude I'm gonna answer your questions

500
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,620
right here on the show this is a quick

501
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,239
one it says I've been wondering if you

502
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,919
know if there are any benefits to

503
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,620
watering cannabis plants with coffee

504
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,559
left over from our morning maybe not

505
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,959
every morning but sometimes my quick

506
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,419
answer to that is the uh the pH is way

507
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,278
too acidic I wouldn't do it because uh

508
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,919
we try to stay in a Pacific a specific

509
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,778
PH range and I'm certain that coffee is

510
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,338
going to be very acidic first of all

511
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,838
when I drink coffee it tastes very

512
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,360
acidic to me I'm not even a huge coffee

513
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,920
fan anymore but it's too acidic that's

514
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,199
going to be my that's the short answer

515
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,659
now it says uh keeping with the coffee

516
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,178
questions what about top dressing with

517
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,279
coffee grounds again uh no now my short

518
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,839
answer was no then it says for these for

519
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,240
any of these questions does it matter if

520
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,938
we use uh coffee beans if the coffee

521
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,338
beans are caffeinated or not thank you

522
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,959
from your friend cronker the final note

523
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:20,279
that I wrote on this paper was just

524
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,019
drink the coffee it sounds like you

525
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,000
really enjoy coffee sounds like you

526
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,798
really enjoy cannabis let's just roll up

527
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,900
a fat join a cannabis and have a nice

528
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,740
fat cup of coffee and enjoy them that

529
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,360
way

530
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,519
um I don't see the benefits I think

531
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,259
you'll probably cause more harm than you

532
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,660
will benefit if you try to induce the

533
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:38,220
coffee into the Cannabis it's a really

534
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,259
good idea I understand you want to be

535
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,759
useful you've got these coffee grounds

536
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,619
you've got some waste you want to use it

537
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,079
if you really want to do it I recommend

538
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,759
putting it into the compost bin compost

539
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,159
it but otherwise you're just going to

540
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,619
totally disrupt the pH of your

541
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,940
rhizosphere for your cannabis plants my

542
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:55,798

we've got another question right here in

554
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:23,759
front of me this one came from our

555
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,679
friend fridge Raider bro you're telling

556
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,779
me bro smoke a few dabs and go raid the

557
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,840
fridge that is a great name this is a

558
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,879
general grow question it says Rasta Jeff

559
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,259
I'm very excited and happy to have your

560
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,940
gear I'm glad you're able to get your

561
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,619
hands on my gear Brother since I've been

562
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,900
listening to the podcast for at least a

563
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,058
year now I pick up I picked up a few

564
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,460
packs from you recently I got Nuketown

565
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:47,220
very great strain uh Nuketown is

566
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,440
Chernobyl to a Golden Goat it says I got

567
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,839
chemical cocktail which is lemon chem to

568
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,538
Afterglow and we've got the maze which

569
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,699
is which is blue raspberry truffle to

570
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:57,839
the Reversed Afterglow once again so a

571
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,819
great lineup of strains that are

572
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,918
Nuketown chemical cocktail and the Maze

573
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:04,259
says I'm very excited but I would be too

574
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,900
that's a good run and also

575
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,759
very good strain selections the chemical

576
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,679
cocktail in the Maze will run

577
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,960
beautifully together and they're going

578
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,240
to have very different very different

579
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,279
effects and flavors and aroma so that's

580
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,179
great the Nuketown will go well in there

581
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,819
but it's going to be a little bit

582
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,900
shorter than the other plants uh so if

583
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:23,220
you're going to run those together I do

584
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,780
the chemical cocktail in the Maze and

585
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,400
then consider the Nuketown on a

586
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,599
different run do your thing if you're

587
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
going to run them all together it will

588
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,678
work but the uh the Nuketown is going to

589
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,259
grow a little bit differently more bushy

590
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,120
less tall than the other plants in the

591
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,038
room I'm sure you can manage it it goes

592
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,659
on though it says I'm very excited I

593
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,879
would like to preserve genetics by

594
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,919
cloning the issue is I've never cloned

595
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,900
anything before and I've been through a

596
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,220
few runs all right now it's time to

597
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,419
learn how to clone bro that's a great

598
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,038
step unfortunately I put out a wonderful

599
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:55,200
cloning podcast it was great in my

600
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,179
opinion it was a wonderful show

601
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,880
YouTube didn't seem to think so because

602
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,280
after it got about 2 000 views in just a

603
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,740
few days YouTube Took the video down so

604
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,019
my how to cut clones and uh cultivate

605
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,400
clones episode with a step-by-step video

606
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,480
I was clipping them dipping them and

607
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,940
sticking them and getting them going

608
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,919
YouTube took it down so I can't refer

609
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,840
you to my clone cutting video I hope and

610
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm sure there are several other clone

611
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,899
cutting videos out there on YouTube I

612
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,120
recommend watching a good video getting

613
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,798
a good education on cloning

614
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,599
but I'm sad they took mine down I

615
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,700
digress let's keep moving here it says

616
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,099
how would you recommend one to clone

617
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,080
without using a store-bought tray and

618
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:33,058
Dome what do you think about putting

619
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,460
clones into tap water to root no that's

620
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:37,319
uh these plants are too high performance

621
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,419
too valuable too precious and we expect

622
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,220
too much out of them to just drop them

623
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,200
into water and expect them to root they

624
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,400
may some of your healthier plants May

625
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
root most of them are just going to

626
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,580
shrivel up and get rotten and die

627
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,558
without some sort of movement without

628
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,058
some air in there they want more than

629
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,519
that and they deserve more than that

630
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:56,759
they also say also what about putting

631
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,619
cuttings into reused soil to root using

632
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,599
cups so I understand what you're saying

633
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,739
you want to use a beer cup like a solo

634
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,079
cup with holes in the bottom for

635
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,480
drainage then use a clear cup up top to

636
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,339
work as a humidity Dome so far out of

637
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,558
all of your ideas that is the best one

638
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,899
that I think I would go with

639
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,339
um you say that the store-bought domes

640
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,798
and trays and everything are expensive

641
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,359
those are super affordable and that is

642
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,279
the way to clone if you want to get

643
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,439
expensive look into buying a turbo

644
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,000
cloner or an easy cloner with a manifold

645
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,400
and a sprayer and a big body and

646
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,679
replaceable collars that's when cloning

647
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
gets [ __ ] expensive I honestly think

648
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,038
you could buy the cloning Dome and tray

649
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,840
and some rapid rooters and you're going

650
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,700
to need however you do this you're going

651
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,439
to need some clone gel of some sort I

652
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,400
recommend the orange the purple clonak

653
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,500
[ __ ]

654
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,240
I think for the price of the cups You're

655
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,980
gonna buy depending on how many clones

656
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,319
you want to make you could probably buy

657
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,480
most of your clone Dome set up for the

658
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,460
same price if you go to a hydroponic

659
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,380
shop or if you even shop on Amazon if

660
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,600
you have to you can get a dome and a

661
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,980
tray for about 15 bucks probably get

662
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,359
some rapid rooters those are going to

663
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,400
run you about 30 bucks for a bag of

664
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,979
Rapid rooters it's really not that much

665
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,600
funding compared to buying cups and

666
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,599
hoping that they work I would encourage

667
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,158
you to encourage you to set yourself up

668
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,558
for success and do this the best way

669
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,299
that you can I understand 45 bucks may

670
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,798
be a lot of money to somebody who isn't

671
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,019
going to make any money off of these

672
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,819
clones you got to wait at least 120 days

673
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,279
before there's any profit any return on

674
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,079
investment but I would just buy the tray

675
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,579
I would buy the Dome I'd buy some rapid

676
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,139
rooters or something similar they don't

677
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,339
have to be rapid rooters there's root

678
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,020
riots there's [ __ ] 20 different

679
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,699
brands out there pick the one that's on

680
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,500
sale they're all mostly reliable they're

681
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,480
all close to the same thing just get the

682
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,339
one that's on sale so you got the tray

683
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,798
maybe the insert you got a dome you got

684
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,658
some rapid rooters and some clone gel

685
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,400
and then you need scissors and then a

686
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,780
way to label these plants and maybe some

687
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,059
alcohol to clean up or something you

688
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,440
don't need a lot of things just invest a

689
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:51,240
few bucks that's what I would totally

690
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,558
recommend I know it sounds like you own

691
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,480
a business you got some money you're

692
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,399
saying spend it I definitely recommend

693
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,079
it's going to be a more enjoyable

694
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,340
process you're going to have more pride

695
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,558
in it you're going to enjoy it more

696
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,939
which means you'll make more time for it

697
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,500
you'll put more effort into it which

698
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,600
means you'll get a better product in the

699
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,740
end so spend a few bucks and when you

700
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,058
spend money then you're going to work

701
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,460
harder because you put money into it

702
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,798
this shit's got to work so that's my

703
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,558
recommendation but the other option was

704
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,259
using recycled soil putting it into a

705
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,058
beer cup and using a clear cup or maybe

706
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,339
even a bag to cover it to keep the

707
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,319
humidity in I can't find a good dome and

708
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:28,139
tray on Amazon there expensive and weird

709
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,759
sizes and fragile they'll get them to

710
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,440
you bro Amazon will not destroy your

711
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,740
clone clone Dome I've gotten plenty

712
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,179
delivered in the mail myself allegedly

713
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,019
and they're not that expensive in the

714
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,900
size you can get a 50 cutting tray it's

715
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,658
only what is 14 inches long 15 maybe

716
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,759
that's about 16 inches long by eight or

717
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,020
nine inches wide that's really not that

718
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,339
big bro and then you just put the dome

719
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,379
right on top of it if you've already got

720
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,058
a grow space with a veg room you can

721
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,559
probably put these in the floor and the

722
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,298
peripheral area where the light goes

723
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,038
they don't need a lot of light just

724
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:00,960
spring for the good gear bro but if you

725
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,319
insist on using soil

726
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,779
in cups and domes uh by using a cup or a

727
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,000
baggie you can absolutely do that but

728
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,918
make sure you use that root gel I still

729
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,659
recommend cutting them and putting them

730
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,520
in some sort of a root gel before you

731
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,679
put them in the dirt that will encourage

732
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,879
root growth much more drastically than

733
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,340
if you just put them in there without

734
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,559
any sort of root hormone also if you

735
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,178
decide to do this I would clean out that

736
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,678
soil so it's not overloaded with

737
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,780
nutrients that are going to burn your

738
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,700
plants you've been feeding that soil

739
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,200
hopefully maybe you flushed a little bit

740
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,640
at the end but maybe you didn't get all

741
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,620
the nutrients out of that soil there's

742
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,480
still stuff in there I would rinse it

743
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:39,058
out if you've got any enzymatic products

744
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,860
some slf-100 some hydrozymes something

745
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,599
like that I would run a little bit of

746
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,639
enzymes mix it in water and run the

747
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,959
enzymes through that soil to help you

748
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,759
flush it out that way it's fresh and

749
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,740
clean there's no pathogens no problems

750
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,679
because basically think of it like this

751
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,019
when we cut clones we are severing a

752
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,880
limb off of that plant would you like me

753
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,038
to just cut your arm off and stick your

754
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,440
arm into just some random dirty dirt and

755
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,440
hope there's no pathogens that take over

756
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,759
and prevent you from growing your arm or

757
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,919
would you rather me give you some sort

758
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,839
of sterile environment with a Chance

759
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
if it was my arm bro I would definitely

760
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,980
recommend that sterile environment and

761
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,960
get a chance but I understand budget may

762
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,120
be the key issue here in the garden so

763
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,220
you can use that recycled soil but rinse

764
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,959
it out make sure you put holes in that

765
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,819
bottom cup so the dirt can or the water

766
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,980
can drain out of the dirt then if you

767
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,480
put a clear cup or a baggie on top make

768
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,679
sure you just seal it up there and then

769
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,659
you're gonna have to learn how to adjust

770
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,820
the airflow to that after a few days

771
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,200
it's going to need some air if you've

772
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,700
got a cup you could poke holes in the

773
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,580
cup the baggie I'm not sure what you're

774
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,798
going to do but your idea will work but

775
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,960
you wouldn't be you will be much more

776
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,599
successful if you just spring for the

777
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,058
Dome the divider thing the little insert

778
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,798
that holds the plugs the plugs and the

779
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,079
tray part I said that backwards the tray

780
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,819
the insert the plugs on the Dome and

781
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,259
maybe like a spray bottle

782
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,579
so you could spray them to keep them

783
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,919
moist that always helps you out a little

784
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:00,359
bit some clonex gel for sure you're

785
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,400
going to need some kind of cloning gel

786
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,839
and clean scissors make sure you clean

787
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,880
the scissors that's definitely important

788
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,399
but I think you can make this happen but

789
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,200
my advice is just spring for the proper

790
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,000
equipment set yourself up for Success

791
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,440
enjoy the grow a little bit better

792
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,900
invest in it you're going to spend that

793
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,278
45 bucks on silly [ __ ] anyway go ahead

794
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,778
and put it into the garden it will

795
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,980
reward you all right my buddy

822
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:15,179
want to breed with and it was from a

823
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:18,778
feminized seed is it okay to use STS to

824
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,340
make her the pollen donor yes absolutely

825
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,558
yes

826
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,720
also would it be okay to then pollinate

827
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,740
another feminized plant with that pollen

828
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,179
donor

829
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,200
yes

830
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,000
yes

831
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,179

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,119
the info you could bless me with bro yes

833
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,860
uh I have done this I do this uh what

834
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,259
strain do I use that is feminized let's

835
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:41,519
pick something oh uh lemon sorbet

836
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,679
somebody else has used the name lemon

837
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,538
sorbet since then but a long time ago a

838
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,360
very very long time ago before the rain

839
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,519
and before the snow I took my Grateful

840
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,918
Dog which is a feminized seed project

841
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,658
that plant is a feminized plant and I

842
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,360
reversed Grateful Dog and I put that

843
00:27:54,659 --> 00:28:00,059
pollen on Lemon Jeffrey lemon Jeffrey is

844
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,798
a feminized project from that reversed

845
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,200
pollen from a reversed from a female

846
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,240
plant put that pollen on another plant

847
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,159
that came from a femme seed guess what

848
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,900
it made it made [ __ ] hot fire that's

849
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,000
one of my favorite crosses that I have

850
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,038
never put out when I first made that

851
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,200
cross I put out a bunch of tester seeds

852
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,058
and right after I did it my social media

853
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,159
account got squashed and I lost contact

854
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:21,960
with a lot of people I was very

855
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,880
discouraged I lost excitement for that

856
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,259
cross and guess what I put all the seeds

857
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,000
in the vault and I've never let them go

858
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,158
to anybody other than those testers I've

859
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,778
got a few of them left myself at the

860
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,700
time I wanted to call them a lemon

861
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:34,980
sorbet I'm pretty sure somebody has

862
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,740
taken that name by now but it was a

863
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,659
Grateful Dog reversed onto the lemon

864
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,778
Jeffrey and both of those are feminized

865
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,600
and it made amazing [ __ ] plants so

866
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,880
yes you can do this sometimes if we go

867
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,918
too far with generations of selfing a

868
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,799
plant things can go weird if we do like

869
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,480
S2 or S3 sometimes we start going the

870
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,579
wrong direction and losing Vigor and

871
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,099
losing the quality traits and we start

872
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:01,918
seeing slow weak plants but most of the

873
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,599
time taking a feminized plant and a

874
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,038
feminized plant that are not related to

875
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,719
each other that have not been inbred

876
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,579
that have not been worked together and

877
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,460
you breed those together that's a new F1

878
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:13,139
that's a new uh S1 or an R1 whichever

879
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,200
one you want to call it but that new F1

880
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,880
is going to have hybrid hybrid Vigor and

881
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,399
I definitely recommend that sort of a

882
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,140
project so have no fear grow your Femme

883
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,058
seeds reverse your Femme seeds breed

884
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,559
with your Femme seeds have fun with them

885
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:28,079
the most important part is to pay

886
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:30,058
attention to what happens to the progeny

887
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,099
you've got to grow those out sometimes

888
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,960
you're going to make some wonky [ __ ] but

889
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:35,699
sometimes you're going to make some

890
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,558
amazing [ __ ] most of the time it'll come

891
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,240
out just like you anticipate if you

892
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,740
could see the traits that come from

893
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,839
plant a and the traits that come from

894
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,399
plant B and you know you've grown them

895
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,139
enough times and you've identified what

896
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,119
they do when you breed them when you

897
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,679
reverse one and pollinate the other you

898
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,178
can easily predict what they're going to

899
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,820
do if you've developed a relationship

900
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,580
with both plants so I recommend breeding

901
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,379
with regulars Femmes breed breed breed

902
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:59,879

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,700
little bit I noticed that people check

942
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,259
out about 36 minutes into a podcast so I

943

definitely keep it around 30 minutes for

944
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:19,379
