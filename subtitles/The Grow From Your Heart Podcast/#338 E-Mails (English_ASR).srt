back from the dispensary with some fresh

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,358
dabs I picked up some blue cheese full

40
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,188
spectrum extract it is UK cheese and

41
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:28,140

46
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,530
concentrates I also picked up more of

47
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,899

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,820
gee and orange juice bud the package

49
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:45,269
describes the aroma and flavor as

50
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,538
ammonia tangerines diesel and hibiscus I

51
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:50,489
get the orange I get the diesel but the

52
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,259
hibiscus I'm not sure if I would

53
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,179
recognize that if it punched me in the

54
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,769
face so that's what I'm dabbing on today

55
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,269
you guys I got the blue cheese and I've

56
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,640
got the orange earth nectar both from

57
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,828
Green Dot labs I also picked up a grab

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,319
of the Doctor Who full spectrum extract

59
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,459
it's described as passionfruit guava and

60
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,409
strawberry taffy

61
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,750
I haven't busted this gram open yet I've

62
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,790
tried this it is always a satisfying

63
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,400
concentrate I also picked up a little

64
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:18,269
bit of the guava papaya nectar described

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,039
as sour and fuel and soft fruits

66
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,670
not sure what soft fruits they're

67
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,379
speaking of but it did have the fuel

68
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:28,439
even astute and then it had the

69
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,319
aftertaste of maybe a green gummy worm

70
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,689
or something in that green candy sort of

71
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,769
a flavor so great concentrates from our

72
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,509
friends at Green Dot they have been

73
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,090
killing it lately that's what I'll be

74
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,889
smoking on on this beautiful rainy cool

75
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,390
weekend it's been so hot in Colorado you

76
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,489
guys and it's been raining for a couple

77
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,469
of days now it has been so nice it's

78
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,930
been a hundred degrees every day it is

79
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:50,580
77 degrees outside it was so nice to go

80
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,010
for a drive getting a little bit of rain

81
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,870
on the windshield it's actually a nice

82
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,280
relief all right you guys don't want to

83
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,200
hear about the weather let's talk about

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,819
podcasting a little bit of an equipment

85
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,469
update you guys know that I had some

86
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,030
equipment failure in the podcast you've

87
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,219
heard it in the past couple of episodes

88
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,349
everyone says quit apologizing but I'm

89
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,270
honestly sincerely I'm sorry that it

90
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,739
sounds like [ __ ] that's not my style I'm

91
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,630
going to record an episode where I'm

92
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,950
going to read listener emails that way

93
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,500
if something craps out we're not losing

94
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,909
too much technical information I don't

95
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,710
feel like I put together a really

96
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,780
intensive episode and had a tech failure

97
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,430
I'm gonna do a couple of email episodes

98
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,959
until I get things solved and once I'm

99
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,819
confident in the equipment again we will

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,409
get back to those intensive gorilla

101
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,489
lessons I promise they're coming you

102
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,289
guys have already got some of them

103
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,270
written out so I want to put them out I

104
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,699
just don't want to frustrate myself by

105
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,469
putting them out half-assed so bear with

106
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,899
me while I work through some email

107
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,219
episodes a couple of random topics we'll

108
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,599
have a couple of fun episodes here and

109
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,069
then we're gonna get back into it

110
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,959
we'll get back into those really

111
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,669
educational and intensive episodes I

112
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,439
just want to make sure that everything

113
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,349
works and I can get it to you guys in

114
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,639
the rasta Jeff expected style all right

115
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,159
that's enough rambling about equipment

116
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,509
and updates where else are we you guys

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,549
I've been talking about the lemon

118
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,709
jeffrey and the golden goat feminized

119
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,390
seeds that are coming those plants have

120
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,680
been chopped down they are drying

121
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,569
they're hanging it will take several

122
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,340
days for those plants to become dry

123
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,079
enough for me to even think about making

124
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,909
them smaller so that I can start pulling

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,770
the seeds out I've gotta let the plants

126
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,329
dry they've got to get cut down into

127
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,040
smaller pieces the buds have to get

128
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,449
chopped into tiny tiny pieces then I

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,489
sift through and get every single seed

130
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,529
out and remove it from the material then

131
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,029
they've got to get packaged it'll be a

132
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,939
little while before they are available

133
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:29,549
but they have been harvested there are

134
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,680
very few seeds in this patch I talked

135
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,100
earlier that it took me a few extra

136
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,689
spray

137
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,610
to get that golden go to reverse this

138
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,350
time it just did not want to go for me I

139
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,480
had to hit it a couple extra times more

140
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,280
than I usually would it finally reversed

141
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,350
I got Paulin out of it I did not make as

142
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,869
many seeds as we would have hoped for I

143
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,060
know what went wrong I know what

144
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,860
happened I just don't know why so I will

145
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,019
make more again in the near future there

146
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,300
will be a regular seed run then I will

147
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,939
consider more feminized lemon Jeff and

148
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,590
golden goat seeds based on the sales of

149
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,209
this current batch so those are done

150
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,099
they'll be ready in just a little bit

151
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,129
they will be very limited in this batch

152
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,840
stay tuned if you're interested alright

153
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,279
let's move into some news before we get

154
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,259
to some listener emails if you've been

155
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,269
following the podcast you know that I've

156
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,579
been updating you on a chain of

157
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,769
dispensaries in Colorado known as sweet

158
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,469
leaf I'll give you a quick update then

159
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:21,180
we'll get into the current situation

160
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,610
sweet leaf had several dispensaries in

161
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,459
Denver they were charged with what was

162
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,379
known as looping in Colorado a customer

163
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,569
is allowed to buy one ounce per person

164
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,219
per day sweet leaf was breaking the rule

165
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,769
and letting people come back multiple

166
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,440
times a day to buy more than one ounce

167
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,819
which was deemed to be illegal the

168
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,790
dispensary was raided and shut down

169
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,920
their licenses in Denver were taken they

170
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,560
had a few stores with remaining licenses

171
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,819
until we read this article this article

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,920
comes from the westward it was written

173
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,899
by Thomas Mitchell and it goes like this

174
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,300
the headline is sweet leaves three

175
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,250
remaining Metro dispensaries suspended

176
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,270
by the meed

177
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,250
sweet leaf isn't out of the law

178
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,719
enforcement and regulatory crosshairs

179
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,120
just because it's been four stores are

180
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,830
no longer open its licenses for the

181
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,199
three remaining sweet leaf dispensaries

182
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,909
in the metro area were all suspended by

183
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,149
the state marijuana Enforcement Division

184
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,240
as of today July 26th you guys I'm

185
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,919
recording on the 27th meb signs on the

186
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,870
doors of sweet leaf dispensaries and

187
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,300
Aurora federal heights and Thornton all

188
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,730
say the store's licenses are suspended

189
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,520
for alleged violation of state medical

190
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,530
or retail marijuana codes while the meed

191
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,089
communications director Shannon gray

192
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,679
confirmed the closures

193
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,259
she declined to go into further detail

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,120
other than noting that sweet leaf is

195
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,170
part of an ongoing investigation and

196
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,420
that any further

197
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,240
meb disciplinary action will depend on

198
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,350
the results of the investigation she did

199
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,900
note that the local law enforcement

200
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,820
agencies helped the meed sir

201
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,839
the suspension so you guys there's more

202
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,879
to this article but it just basically

203
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,709
updates us from what happened in the

204
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,319
past so sweetleaf had a few more

205
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:57,719
dispensaries and now they have been shut

206
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,219
down sweet leaf is really struggling you

207
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,320
guys I will keep you updated with what

208
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,229
goes on with the sweet leaf closures as

209
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,668
things progress all right now let's

210
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,560
shift gears a little bit and work on

211
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,879
some listen or emails if you guys want

212
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,949
to send me an email to read on the show

213
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
my email address is grow from your heart

214
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,509
at hotmail.com I do appreciate the

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,490
interaction I do apologize I have not

216
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,650
responded to emails on the show and

217
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,930
quite a while I've been working on those

218
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,668
groans as you have heard but I've got an

219
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,759
opportunity for some email so let's get

220
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:28,560
right into it several days ago I was on

221
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,449
a podcast called the growing with fishes

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,939
podcast and they asked me a question

223
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:35,580
about what was coming up for my podcast

224
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,019
and what I had planned for the future my

225
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,969
response to that question was that I

226
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,948
wanted to learn how to interview

227
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,139
breeders better and have more people on

228
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,090
the show that didn't mean that I wanted

229
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,918
to abandon the format and totally change

230
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,598
everything I just meant that it would be

231
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,490
nice to be able to call up my buddy sub

232
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,649
cool and talk to some cool and get him

233
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,240
on the show it'd be cool to go up to

234
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:55,978
Denver and see Colin from the ethos

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,900
collective and get him on the podcast it

236
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:59,219
would be cool to get mr. Sol because

237
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,109
they all live just right in Denver

238
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,340
they're not too far away from me it'd be

239
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,590
great to have them on the show but I

240
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,329
need to practice on people who aren't uh

241
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,158
who don't intimidate me who I don't have

242
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,810
so much respect for I guess and get

243
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,819
better at actually interviewing people

244
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,228
so one of the things I said is that I

245
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,418
wanted to become a better interviewer

246
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,430
and interview folks on the show that

247
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,598
inspired this email this is from

248
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,550
somebody who I've interacted with

249
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,199
several times I'm not sure if they want

250
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,240
their name set on the show so I will

251
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,370
just read their message and the message

252
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,228
goes like this he said I just want to

253
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,120
tell you you're doing a great job and I

254
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:31,680
enjoyed the show growing with Fishes

255
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,839
this morning please do not change

256
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,028
anything please do not change your

257
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,979
concept we enjoy learning from you an

258
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:40,019
interview show every now and then is

259
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,060
okay but keep doing the good work that

260
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,458
you do I have learned so much from you

261
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,319
and my product is so much better my

262
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,479
patients love my product now that I've

263
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,400
been learning by who it feels is one of

264
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,110
the greatest teachers out there I have

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,259
listened to other podcast and other

266
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,820
shows and none of them compared to yours

267
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,899
then he also asked for some suggestions

268
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,610
he said I just wanted to know if you

269
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,019
have any suggestions with one of

270
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,300
plants and then he sends me a picture of

271
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,769
a scarlet begonias plant it looks

272
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,990
beautiful he said I grew up from seed

273
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,089
it's about four feet tall now but it is

274
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,799
stopped growing and just flowering out

275
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,200
thanks for all of your help and keep up

276
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,458

278
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,239

00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,489
doing a good job dude thank you for the

280
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,139
compliments I appreciate that I was

281
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,639
struggling for a couple episodes with

282
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,039
the show but I feel like we are back on

283

growing with fishes show I hope you

285
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,689
enjoyed that that is available on

286
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,370
YouTube for everybody else to listen to

287
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,040

288
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,509
Benny says do not change anything don't

289
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,429

290
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,889
learning I do not plan to change

291
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,599
anything I just want to add a couple of

292
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,720
more things to what I can do I need to

293
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,040
be more versatile in my podcast imagine

294
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,720
how many people would listen if we had

295
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,458
sub cool on here imagine how many more

296
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,250
people would it would expose the show to

297
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:56,399
so things like that or advantageous for

298
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,958
a podcast you've got the right idea an

299
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,850
interview every now and then would be

300
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,619
cool and I do plan on keeping up the

301
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,050
grow lessons in the grow episodes that's

302
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,730
my goal and dude you said you're

303
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,229
learning by who it feels is one of the

304
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,480
greatest teachers out there thank you I

305
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,610
appreciate that that means a lot to me

306
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,870
it means a lot that people are learning

307
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,190
from me that your garden is getting

308
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,690
better that your patients are enjoying

309
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,399
your garden better and that you were

310
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,500
probably just enjoying growing more

311
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,089

312

00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,740
because it has reached its critical

331
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,290
period it is getting a long enough night

332
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,539
cycle now where that plant knows that

333
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,639
fall and winter are coming and it needs

334
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,620
to flower it is doing exactly what it is

335
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,539
supposed to do it is a photoperiod plant

336
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,278
that means that when the fall starts

337
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,409
coming when the light cycle starts

338
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,509
getting shorter we have longer and I

339
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,850
in shorter days that plant goes oh and

340
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,620
it's time for me to start putting out my

341
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,240
buds because it wants to flower out it's

342
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,129
an annual plant these are only supposed

343
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,230
to live for one year so now it's gonna

344
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,819
put out its buds the whole goal of this

345
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,589
plant is to get pollinated it's gonna

346
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:30,479
put out buds with big sticky pistols

347
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,800
those are the hairs its goal is to get

348
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,300
pollinated it won't get pollinated

349
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,219
hopefully hopefully no one in your

350
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,599
neighborhoods got a male outdoors so

351
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,399
it's not gonna get pollinated it will

352
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,350
just keep stacking up calyxes which are

353
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,059
basically where the seeds would go

354
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,278
because it wants seeds it wants to

355
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,899
create seed so at the end of the season

356
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,278
it can dry up it would still be standing

357
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,839
there on the stock at the end of the

358
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,338
season if it weren't disturbed by any

359
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,189
people or anything if this were nature

360
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,079
it would dry out on that stick and then

361
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:56,610
those seeds would fall into the dirt and

362
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,409
then it would freeze over over the

363
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,720
winter then all that moisture would thaw

364
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:02,309
out in the springtime and then it would

365
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,509
germinate those seeds all that warmth

366
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,799
and that water would tell those seeds

367
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,180
hey it's time to go and they would start

368
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,799
sprouting up and then he'd repeat that

369
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,419
cycle it would veg out through the

370
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,649
spring then it would get nice and tall

371
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,809
like your plant here is in the backyard

372
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,970
and then about this time of year it

373
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,739
would start flowering out so your plant

374
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,959
is doing exactly what it should do I

375
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,089
think your plant looks pretty good it's

376
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,948
going to be taller than that block wall

377
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm already warning you if you're trying

378
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:26,068
to hide it behind those other plants

379
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,750
that are there and that block wall

380
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:29,448
you're gonna have to start doing some

381
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,309
tricks you need to tie that thing down

382
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,828
maybe get some string or some fishing

383
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,208
line or something maybe something softer

384
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,620
than that to attach it to the plant

385
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,379
maybe like a couple of twisty ties a

386
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,730
bread tie a fuzzy stick do a couple of

387
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,470
things to attach it to the plant so it's

388
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,930
not all pressure on one spot and not too

389
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,759
tight but tie it to the plant and then

390
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,739
just bend it over like a fishing pole

391
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,240
just bend that [ __ ] over don't break it

392
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,139
just bend it over you'll know you'll be

393
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,448
able to feel when you're pulling too

394
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,278
hard just bend it over until it's gonna

395
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:58,229
arched over and then it'll start growing

396
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,698
straight up again but bend it over and

397
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,230
then if you have to keep bending it keep

398
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:04,019
doing it because that plant is gonna get

399
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,399
tall out there in the sunshine and it's

400
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,429
got quite a ways to go it's not gonna

401
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,379
come down until probably Halloween so

402
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,198
you've got a long ways to grow that

403
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,610
plant outdoors but your question sounded

404
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:16,859
like you were worried about it honestly

405
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,329
that plant is doing exactly what it's

406
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,318
supposed to do so hey bro thank you for

407
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:21,299
the great email thanks for the

408
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:23,399
compliments don't worry we won't change

409
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,008
the format and please keep the good

410
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,360
pictures and emails coming all right

411
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,620
this next email I thought was

412
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,169
I thought I'd read this one on the show

413
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,120
it says Rasta Jeff please don't use my

414
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,299
name on the air if you read I won't do

415
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,679
that I'll be cool for a bro then he says

416
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,990
long time listener and cannabis

417
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,489
enthusiast here I love the show and I

418
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,759
look forward to the new episodes Mondays

419
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,829
and Thursdays of every week anyway I was

420
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,269
looking into some clones in Colorado and

421
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:51,239
I was wondering if you had any

422
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,799
recommendations as far as nurseries go I

423
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,320
have a friend who loves granddaddy

424
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,028
purple to help with his insomnia so a

425
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,560
nursery that carries these would be

426
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:00,509
great thanks for always putting out

427
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,439
fantastic information and helping to

428
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:07,799
educate people across the country stay

429
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,959
Irie Hey Dude thank you for the

430
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,278
compliments he looks forward to the

431
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,869
episodes that means a lot to me that

432
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,759
people are just looking forward to it

433
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,089
that means you're enjoying it means I'm

434
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,309
not just rambling to the air um so this

435
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,829
one kind of put a weird visual in my

436
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:25,109
head for some reason I envisioned

437
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:28,639
somebody walking into like the home

438
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:31,589
depot nursery area or like whatever

439
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,569
Jeff's Gro Emporium if you want to go to

440
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,880
the mom and pops type type style shop

441
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,949
and they walk in and the guy's like oh

442
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,570
how you doing ma'am are indicas are over

443
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:41,429
here or sativas over here we've got our

444
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,528
hybrids placed over here if you're

445
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:45,028
looking for the head stash we've got

446
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:47,159
that over here and our elite cuts are

447
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:49,769
kept back here and somebody walks easier

448
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,120
this little fancy area um dude I [ __ ]

449
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,769
wish it was like that it is not like

450
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,019
that at all finding clones in Colorado

451
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,839
is not going to be as easy as you think

452
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,759
it is there are no nurseries like you

453
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,949
speak up you have to go to dispensaries

454
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,909
and those dispensaries may have a tray

455
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:07,349
or two of okay-looking clones that may

456
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:09,208
be labeled properly and I know that

457
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,528
sounds very cynical and that doesn't

458
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,659
sound very positive and it may sound

459
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:14,879
kind of discouraging but to tell you the

460
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:18,389
truth I have purchased clones from

461
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,309
dispensaries several times I'll say 10

462
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,889
times that's probably close to accurate

463
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:25,169
and I'm gonna say six out of ten times

464
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:27,149
those plants were not labeled accurately

465
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,819
back in the day I went to a dispensary

466
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,649
that no longer exists they used to carry

467
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,910
a strain that was really hyped at the

468
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,679
time it was brand new it was when

469
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,539
medical marijuana was just getting super

470
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,649
popular and all these hype strains were

471
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,120
really coming out the strain was

472
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,799
featured in high times it was in several

473
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
of their magazines this is

474
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,699
three only offered small batches of it

475
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,700
they had a batch that was supposed to

476
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,320
drop on my birthday the dispensary was

477
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,060
two hours from my house I went up there

478
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,560
there were some I called them the night

479
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,539
before I was like I would like to buy

480
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,458
the limit of this strain that you sell

481
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,838
and I would like to buy the limit of

482
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,309
clones that I can purchase and they're

483
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,640
like sure we'll do that for you come on

484
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,588
in

485
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,689
so I showed up at this dispensary when

486
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,180
they're supposed to open it started

487
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,440
snowing that morning ah so not a big

488
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,759
deal but I had to drive to Denver in the

489
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,750
snow that was kind of a [ __ ] then we

490
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,879
get there I realized it is daylight

491
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,549
savings time it's the first day that the

492
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,259
time moved forward so the dispensary

493
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,849
opened an hour late I sat in front of

494
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,528
the dispensary in line with other people

495
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,820
for an hour because they announced that

496
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,320
they were getting this drop of this

497
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,000
strain that would go on sale that day

498
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,740
and it just happened to be my birthday I

499
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,328
called him I was like bro save me the

500
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,039
limit the limit per customer was a

501
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:33,719
quarter so they had a quarter of that

502
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,278
saved for me I won't mention the strain

503
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,899
I won't mention the dispensary cos will

504
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,028
but it doesn't need to be said right now

505
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,860
but that a quarter they're supposed to

506
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,409
have I think the limit that I could get

507
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,000
was six clones so I get in there and I

508
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,078
was like man I'm uh this guy called last

509
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,490
night he goes oh yeah the notes right

510
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,289
here I'm the one that talked to you but

511
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,028
I sold all that strain last night I

512
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:53,490
almost said the name of the strain I was

513
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:55,620
like bro I drove up here from Pueblo to

514
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,299
get that bag for my birthday it's my

515
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,190
birthday too I came up here just to get

516
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,419
that and you're supposed to have six

517
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,310
clones for me to and he goes oh he

518
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,409
didn't bring the clones yet and I was

519
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,549
like so what am i up here for man and

520
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,790
he's like I'll tell you what dude I'll

521
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,049
go to the car and I will get you this is

522
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,369
way back in the day you guys the rules

523
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,139
are way different now you went to the

524
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,178
car and got his head stash of this

525
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,250
strain and brought it into the store and

526
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,589
weighed me out seven grams for myself

527
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,880
and sold it to me out of his bag because

528
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,588
it was my birthday and he didn't want to

529
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,449
[ __ ] over the stores reputation cuz I

530
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:27,000
shop there quite frequently for it being

531
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,130
so far away then he called his buddy to

532
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,200
bring me the clones the clones arrived

533
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,850
they were all in rapid Reuters they were

534
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,549
barely rooting they kind of looked like

535
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,750
[ __ ] he told me if I bought all six of

536
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,279
them that he would only charge me for

537
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,990
three since it was my birthday and that

538
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,918
I'd kind of had a shitty experience and

539
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,109
he made me sit in front of the

540
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,850
dispensary for an hour so I got six

541
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:47,369
clones for the price of three and I

542
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,389
bought the bag of the hypes train that

543
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:51,359
I'd been looking for

544
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,590
I brought the plants home I potted on my

545
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,479
flower to mount you guys there were

546
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:56,308
three different [ __ ] plants

547
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,370
that batch of clones and none of them

548
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:01,319
were the strain that I paid for okay bad

549
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,089
dispensary was in Denver I went to

550
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,918
another dispensary in Colorado Springs

551
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:08,399
and I purchased what was supposed to be

552
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,230
lemon OG and blueberry they were selling

553
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
this amazing lemon OG flower

554
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,798
it was delicious every time I would buy

555
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,900
it it would be bright green buds with

556
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,879
these bright orange highlights in it it

557
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,009
was just frosty and it smell like lemons

558
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,120
it was amazing so I bought the clone I

559
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,190
was like I can grow the [ __ ] out of that

560
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,539
no matter how I drew it it wouldn't come

561
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,580
out like that that was not the same

562
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,460
clone they falsely advertised that that

563
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,750
clone was that strain it was not they

564
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,700
just wanted to sell more clones they

565
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,259
probably had some [ __ ] they realized

566
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,429
this sucks and I just wanted to clone it

567
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,289
out and get rid of it and make a few

568
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,360
bucks off of that plant so they just cut

569
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:41,039
it stuck it in rapid Reuters barely got

570
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,629
it rooted and [ __ ] sold it to people

571
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,519
the blueberry they sold me was actually

572
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,530
tremendous and I really loved that but

573
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,179
that lemon thing they sold me was not

574
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,369
what was advertised so that's two prime

575
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,890
examples of being duped and sold clones

576
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:54,539
that were not labeled properly and not

577
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,960
what I expected and not what I paid for

578
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:59,909
and also you can't just go looking for a

579
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,500
specific strain they don't cut there's

580
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,269
not a dispensary that just cuts a bunch

581
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,279
of a certain strain to put out on the

582
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,019
Shelf to have them for customers that

583
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,428
kind of that's counterintuitive for a

584
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,168
dispensary they don't want you growing

585
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,790
because they want you shopping and

586
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,040
buying from them so they're not gonna

587
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,569
give you their head stash there are a

588
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,339
few dispensaries at which you can

589
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:19,139
purchase clones I don't know what they

590
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,849
will have ever they don't know what

591
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,950
they'll have you can't order them from

592
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:25,019
them you can't make requests the grow

593
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,460
will cut clones they will manifest it in

594
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,259
a transfer to the store the store will

595
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,660
receive it they'll put it on the shelves

596
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:32,160
hopefully someone at the store will have

597
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,440
some knowledge on how to take care of

598
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
the clones I don't know where to send

599
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,400
you because if I recommend a facility or

600
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,960
a dispensary and you go there and you

601
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,820
buy a clone and they give you some ship

602
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,529
it's got mites on it or turns out to not

603
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,629
be what it was labeled then I feel like

604
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:49,079
it's partly on me because I recommended

605
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:51,570
the place however I did buy a Durbin

606
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,418
poison clone from kind love several

607
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:58,439
years ago and it was absolutely Durbin

608
00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:01,230
poison it was absolutely bug free also I

609
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,259
got a platinum og clone from the clinic

610
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,289
it was absolutely platinum og and it was

611
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,309
absolutely bug free but honestly not to

612
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,139
bust your bubble dude

613
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,539
like you're expecting something that

614
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,640
doesn't really exist there is a place in

615
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,409
Denver that advertises that they have a

616
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,700
ton of clones available I drove there

617
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,170
one time with a lot of money in my

618
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,610
pocket and a couple of friends in the

619
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,769
car because we're limited on how many

620
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:24,179
plants we can buy we all knew the drill

621
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:26,069
we were all gonna buy our limit they

622
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,960
were all going to one garden this place

623
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:29,849
had nothing but [ __ ] spider mites

624
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,410
powdery mildew and embarrassing clones

625
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,809
available so I don't even want to say

626
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,000
the name of their place I don't want to

627
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,200
send you there to go [ __ ] up your garden

628
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,839
because that's basically what you'll be

629
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,009
doing all right in the same email you

630
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,809
mentioned that your friend loves

631
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,779
granddaddy purple and you would love a

632
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:48,269
granddaddy purple clone the GDP is

633
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,069
readily available in seed form so what I

634
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,109
would recommend is that you order some

635
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:53,490
seeds I would check with dank seed store

636
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:55,619
and see if they've got the granddaddy

637
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,930
purple seeds available and get yourself

638
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,029
a pack maybe two packs of those and grow

639
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,650
them out grow out whatever your legal

640
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,829
limit is if you're allowed six plants

641
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,290
grow six dry them cure them then take

642
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:09,329
samples to your friend label it GDP 1

643
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:10,710
GDP - you know what I mean so that you

644
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,839
know what he's smoking so that you know

645
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,059
which each plant is so I guess grow it

646
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,339
keep a clone of it then flower it out

647
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,960
then let him smoke it and his favorite

648
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,609
it'll have two favorite so be two that

649
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,470
you got to narrow it down from keep

650
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,750
those two and grow them again and then

651
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,100
give him a blind test does this one or

652
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,539
does this one work for you and then see

653
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,879
which one works best and then you've got

654
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,609
the best granddaddy purple phenotype

655
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,110
from seed that is perfect for your

656
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,209
friend that's what a good caregiver does

657
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,409
that's what we do for patients that some

658
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,450
of the difference between just being a

659
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,279
cash crop er and a commercial grower and

660
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,319
being somebody that is growing to help

661
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,750
somebody heal and improve the quality

662
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,759
and enjoy their life a little bit better

663
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,470
so I recommend getting some seeds bro

664
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,140
and growing out some granddaddy purple

665
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,730
seeds they are not hard to find my

666
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,340
friend it will be easier to find than a

667
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,450
clean granddaddy purple cut hey bro

668
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,279
thanks for reaching out thanks for the

669
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,960
great email and dude good job trying to

670
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,750
take care of your friend I hope he is

671
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,789
able to find some relief from his

672
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,710
insomnia says he's smoking for insomnia

673
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:09,450
is why he likes the GDP

674
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,950
alright Jays let's move on to the next

675
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,480
email this next email comes from let's

676
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,559
see they don't want their name said so

677
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,210
we're gonna get right into it it says

678
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,710
hello Rasta Jeff long time listener of

679
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,250
the wonderful podcast writing for

680
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,710
prohibition land in India

681
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,940
Annagh it be careful out there it says

682
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,049
thank you for all the great knowledge

683
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,789
that you have given me

684
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,619
you're very welcome please bring more

685
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:30,879
Gro talk I'm doing my best bro I got to

686
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:33,759
get this equipment fixed and we'll get

687
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,650
it going then he says I've recently

688
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,569
started an indoor grow and I'm having

689
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,550
some issues with a few of my plants the

690
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:41,980
leaves old and new are starting to curl

691
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:43,690
under and wilt not to the point where

692
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,000
they are falling off and dying but they

693
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,430
just don't look the happiest like I want

694
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,500
then he describes his setup quite a bit

695
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,259
and he says one thing I'm thinking maybe

696
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,509
the issue is when I adjust the pH the

697
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:58,660
tap water seems like it takes a lot

698
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:02,680
maybe six to nine mils of pH adjusting

699
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:05,140
solution to get from 7.2 to 6.4 so maybe

700
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,730
it could be my starting water equality I

701
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,340
am letting it sit a few hours before

702
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,309
using it if that matters my humidity

703
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:15,279
stays between 50 and 65 percent temps

704
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,559
are between 78 and 80 degrees all of the

705
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,990
plants are not affected only a few all

706
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,119
leaves aren't affected only a few on the

707
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,410
plants which are affected I've attached

708
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,269
some pics which I have looked at we'll

709
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,340
talk about him then he says what the

710
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:29,349
strain is supposed to be I says he's

711
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,419
growing in a 10 by 10 room 600 watts of

712
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:33,369
light it's got a nice setup he's

713
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,990
describing the setup am i overlooking

714
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:36,789
something should I not worry about it

715
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,220
then he asked could this be chlorine

716
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,930
chloramine or other octet other toxicity

717
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,299
from the tap water anything you can come

718
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,610
up with could be helpful thank you so

719
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:47,799
much and I've attached pics stay I

720
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:49,449
really says you can't say my name from

721
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,849
Adam hey Adam thank you for the great

722
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,440
email um and from looking at your

723
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,399
pictures and from what you've said there

724
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,640
are a couple things that get my

725
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,040
attention first off I would calibrate my

726
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,170
pH meter if I were you it sounds like

727
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,220
that pH meter could be off I don't know

728
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,509
what you've got I don't know if you were

729
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,650
using drops I don't know if you've got a

730
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,869
blue lab I don't know if you've got a

731
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,550
Milwaukee I would calibrate it that

732
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:11,949
would be the first thing I do if you

733
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,389
can't calibrate it yourself maybe if you

734
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,370
take it to the grow shop I know my local

735
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,540
grow up and be happy to help you out so

736
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,919
if you just take the pin to the gross

737
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,569
store and be like hey can you guys show

738
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,890
me how to calibrate this or maybe they

739
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,299
can check it for you and they can say aw

740
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,620
dude you've been so far off and that's

741
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,269
why it's taken so much to adjust

742
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:28,689
honestly I don't know how much water

743
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:30,099
you're adjusting ah you said I take six

744
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,259
to nine mils I've been in a facility

745
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,759
where it took an ounce to adjust our pH

746
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,940
to the proper solution because we were

747
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,490
using so much

748
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,950
water to start with so it I'm not sure

749
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,420
how that doesn't sound too too crazy to

750
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,390
me six to nine mils doesn't sound like a

751
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,610
lot to move it a few points um also from

752
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,320
looking at your plants it could be a pH

753
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:50,240
issue it does kind of look like they're

754
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,149
stuck there's something and not getting

755
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,529
fed and something is stuck also from

756
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,720
looking at the plants it looks like they

757
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,980
are a little bit possibly over watered

758
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,140
that's what the leaves do when they're

759
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,150
over watered they curl down and they

760
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,310
start to make what I call the claw the

761
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,950
Handy claw they're just squeezed in

762
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:09,559
there look like they're angry they kind

763
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,180
of have that so it could be pH it could

764
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,889
be an over watering which could be

765
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,450
coming together if you're over watering

766
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,980
it's gonna disrupt your pH it's gonna

767
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,019
really throw off everything there in the

768
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:24,799
root zone also the leaves have a

769
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:27,289
leathery tough wrinkled look to them I'm

770
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,750
going to say that you should listen to

771
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,240
the episode about vapor pressure deficit

772
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,759
it looks like those leaves are possibly

773
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,640
a little crispy a little dry like the

774
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,339
air around those specific plants is too

775
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,890
dry I want to know are they getting over

776
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:45,049
watered is your pH meter accurate and

777
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,580
are these plants sitting right in front

778
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,589
of the fan the plants that are getting

779
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,089
problems are they near the fan is that

780
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,220
where you've got some ventilation coming

781
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:53,899
in is there a different air right there

782
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,839
that's what I think could be causing it

783
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,330
so it's pH it's over water or it is

784
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,309
extreme airflow disrupting the vapor

785
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:03,829
pressure deficit right there around

786
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,359
those leaves we're gonna have to do more

787
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,409
research that's how cannabis works

788
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,789
you're gonna have to figure out what

789
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,019
you're gonna have to investigate you're

790
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,930
gonna have to dial it in a little bit

791
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,400
and see what is going on yeah I really

792
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,380
do appreciate the great email Adam I

793
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,330
hope we solved some problems thanks for

794
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,860
listening to the show I look forward to

795
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,839
some feedback I look forward to more

796
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,659
pictures and I hope we're able to get

797
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,649
your garden back up to speed

798
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,820
honestly dude most of the garden looks

799
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,130
pretty good if you've only got a few

800
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:30,169
leaves like that you're okay but if it

801
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,370
starts spreading and going rampant we're

802
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,050
gonna have to figure out what's causing

803
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,029
that and we're gonna have to fix it and

804
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,409
correct it very quickly so keep me

805
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,960
updated keep me posted

806
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,750
hopefully we can get your garden back up

807
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,190
to a plus condition all right you guys I

808
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,809
think that is enough emails for this

809
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,940
episode if you've sent me an email

810
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,250
recently or in a long time and I haven't

811
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,048
read

812
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,640
don't worry I have got a pile of emails

813
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:52,440
printed out I haven't been doing

814

Tanner EM you guys before I start

827
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,298
wrapping up this episode I've got one

828
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:22,710
more thing I want to rant about I was at

829
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:23,970
a friend's garden the other day I was

830
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,200
kind of helping him do some things kind

831
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,390
of teaching him some tricks and tips

832
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,279
trying to get his garden up to speed and

833
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,690
he was mixing up his nutrients and he

834
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,399
simply picked up the bottle off the

835
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,750
shelf and he picked up a little

836
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,220
measuring device that He pours it into

837
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,390
and he measured how many mils he needed

838
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,009
in there and then he threw it right into

839
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,470
the gallon or the five-gallon bucket of

840
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:43,259
water and then he just did the next one

841
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,179
the same way and I was like bro shake

842
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,529
the bottles man he's like what and I was

843
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,090
like dude think about it all the good

844
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,769
stuff is in the bottom of that bottle

845
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:51,298
all the heavy stuff that we're paying

846
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,829
for all the stuff the plants want to eat

847
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:54,569
that's probably sinking right to the

848
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:56,308
bottom of your nutrients so if you've

849
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:58,379
got a bottle whatever it is if it's your

850
00:27:56,308 --> 00:28:00,298
grow your micro your bloom whatever

851
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,159
solution you've got there shake that

852
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:03,658
bottle up before you pour it out because

853
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,669
there's a lot of water in there that

854
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,440
thing's like 90% water you want to at

855
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:09,000
least spread those inert ingredients out

856
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,798
right you don't just want to give it the

857
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,970
top little water to earth at the end of

858
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:12,480
the crop you're feeding at all the

859
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,100
chunks

860
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,419
have you ever finished a bottle of

861
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:17,668
nutrients and then just had a bunch of

862
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,830
chunky funky salty [ __ ] in the bottom of

863
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,590
it that's probably because you weren't

864
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:25,710
shaking it hard enough or enough often

865
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,449
enough before you were using it when you

866
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,669
were mixing up your nutrient solutions

867
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,409
and all the salts just stayed in the

868
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:33,150
bottom you just poured out the water and

869
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:37,260
he fed your plants 30 mils of mostly

870
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,820
water instead of 30 mils of NPK so shake

871
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,890
those nutrient bottles before you pour

872
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,750
it into your measuring device and then

873
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,630
as you're pouring the nutrients into the

874
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,130
water I would just pour one in there and

875
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,450
then give it a little stir and then pour

876
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,669
the next one don't pour them to where

877
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,620
they touch without being diluted by a

878
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:54,690
bunch of water the nutrients are sold in

879
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,689
two different containers for a reason

880
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,759
try not to let them mix until they hit a

881
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,630
larger container of water you don't want

882
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,599
the too content or

883
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,640
bottles those two products touching they

884
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,039
will bond there's a reason why they're

885
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,810
sold separately just shake em and then

886
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,190
Parman separately that's my advice you

887
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,079
