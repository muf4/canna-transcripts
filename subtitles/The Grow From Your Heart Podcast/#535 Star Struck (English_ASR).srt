26
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,589
smoking today I've been taking dad's of

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,170
garlic Grove live batter from Green Dot

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,469
labs on the package it says this is a

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,420
blend of GMO cookies and Loa f2 the

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,688
flavor is described as General Tso's

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,430
garlic and orange soda I'm going to

32
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,618
completely agree with that flavor

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,439
description when I crack the jar open I

34
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:22,259
am hit with this pungent funky delicious

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,109
orange aroma it is almost like a nasty

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,670
potent gross oranges maybe oranges and

37
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,578
armpits coming out of here right when I

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,159
open it then when I take a DAB I was

39
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,078
overwhelmed by orange and citrus my

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,540
mouth was loaded up with orange Terps

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,819
then on the exhale that is when that

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,070
garlic kind of kicks in it kind of just

43
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,539
lingers on the tongue after you smoke it

44
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,728
you have it sort of tastes like you ate

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,470
orange garlic chicken or orange garlic

46
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,688
tofu if you're a hippie but it's got

47
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,868
that orange garlic general tso flavor to

48
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:51,449
it

49
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,069
really delicious also obviously it has

50
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,840
got me good and stoned

51
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,609

this it says hey Rasta Jeff I listen to

103
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,129
a lot of podcasts on similar subject

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,919
matters and you are the best speaking

105
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,180
voice in terms of pronunciation

106
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,219
thoroughness if that's a correct word

107
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,590
and truly making points of a clear

108
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,000
understanding details for your audience

109
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,939
to comprehend

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,318
hey that means a lot to me thank you I

111
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,269
get a lot of emails from people saying

112
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:01,789
they cannot [ __ ] stand the way that I

113
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,560
talk that is cool with me because I try

114
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,449
to speak very clearly so that people can

115
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,909
understand me some people don't like

116
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,709
that I make too many pauses part of that

117
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,930
honestly is for editing it's much easier

118
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,299
to edit a short pause instead of editing

119
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,400
a long run on sins so when I'm talking

120
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,750
and talking then there's a new sentence

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,060
and it's just a weird skip and an edit

122
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,949
so a couple of pauses do allow for some

123
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,139
easier editing also I think it's easier

124
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,329
for people to understand a couple of

125
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,339
pauses make me think of my talking speed

126
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:29,289
I can get really

127
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,149
carried away and talked really fast if I

128
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,550
don't take some breaths and pauses so

129
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,779
the pauses are for all of us to get

130
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,400
along a little better it makes the

131
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,769
teaching better it makes me pay more

132
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,448
attention so I apologize if people don't

133
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:42,219
like the pauses the good part is this

134
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,079
person really enjoys it they think that

135
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,870
I speak well they speak I speak clearly

136
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,698
and uh I've got thoroughness if that's

137
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,189
even a real word but I know Qi mean I do

138
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,750
sometimes try to look at a subject from

139
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:55,149
multiple different angles because I know

140
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,189
that people learn from way different

141
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,599
styles a lot of people have to actually

142
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,668
put their hands on something to learn

143
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,830
something some people have to learn it

144
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:04,539
like in a creative way some people have

145
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:07,000
to learn it in a real analytical way I

146
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,740
try to approach teaching in a way that

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,990
everybody can learn because I really

148
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,460
love to learn mm-hmm excuse me for all

149
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,810
this look throat-clearing I'm going to

150
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,209
blame that on our friends at Green Dot

151
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,009
labs I really love to learn but I did

152
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,538
not like school sitting there for hours

153
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,209
at a time having somebody drone on about

154
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:24,219
some [ __ ] it really bored me when I

155
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,319
had creative teachers who engage and

156
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,940
didn't just stand in front of the class

157
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,250
at a board and write [ __ ] on a board if

158
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:32,879
they gave us activities I noticed that I

159
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,319
excelled and enjoyed that class better

160
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,060
so my goal is to try to teach in a way

161
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,379
that I can keep people focused and

162
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,269
entertain them then I'm kind of a

163
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,860
smartass I tell some jokes in there so I

164
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:43,659
feel like those nuggets are funny or

165
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,129

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,879
rambley I thank you for noticing that I

171
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,949
try hard to teach in a way that

172
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,228
everybody can comprehend that goes on to

173
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,300
say I find so many pop broadcasters come

174
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:03,069
across mumbly ish or they repeat silly

175
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,829
phrases like you know what I'm saying uh

176
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,930
or they say like a lot a lot of people

177
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,668
do say like too many times I do catch

178
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,870
myself saying catchphrases you know that

179
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,699
I've got all the catchphrases at the

180
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,918
start of the show and [ __ ] but I thank

181
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,418
you for noticing I try not to say you

182
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,649
know what I'm saying and like and [ __ ]

183
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,538
like that because that drives me crazy

184
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,739
you don't know what I'm saying if you

185
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:22,269
knew what I was saying I wouldn't have

186
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,769
to say it so you know what I'm saying is

187
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:26,319
no I don't know what you're saying

188
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,639
tell me right it's [ __ ] language is

189
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,990
crazy and I appreciate it when people

190
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,300
speak well so thank you for noticing

191
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,519
that I try hard it also goes on to say

192
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,840
not only do I and others take your show

193
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,490
more seriously because of your

194
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,560
professional sounding approach in detail

195
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,269
but also the good vibes of sharing and

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,160
caring you put through shines through

197
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,949
man thank you a lot I appreciate that

198
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,720
hmm I think that speaking well shows

199
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,639
that my brain is working and I [ __ ]

200
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,350
put some thought into this and then

201
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,550
what's the part that I really like

202
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,620
they're professional sounding approach

203
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,180
that's that's mandatory ah the good

204
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,189
vibes I'm glad that comes through I

205
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,900
don't know that that shows I just

206
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,550
recently started doing video so now you

207
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,500
can see my smiling face and see that I'm

208
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,759
filled with good vibes but I don't know

209
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
that good vibes come through on a

210
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,569
recording that wasn't I try to have fun

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
I said a moment ago I try to be kind of

212
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,319
funny and tell jokes I'm a [ __ ] witty

213
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,029
funny dude I'm kind of I'd like to have

214
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,560
fun fun is important to me you're not

215
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,149
having fun what the [ __ ] you haven't so

216
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,829
I'm glad that you get the good vibes

217
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,599
it's hard to know that that is conveying

218
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,339
in a recording I don't know that I'm

219
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,960
passing that on I just know that I'm

220
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:25,819
when I'm editing I'm not looking for

221
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,319
good vibes do you sound like a good vibe

222
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,670
that's not on my list of [ __ ] to look

223
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,589
for so I'm glad that that's coming

224

225

239
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:04,099
I'm doing right you told me that the

240
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,620
vibe comes through that means a lot to

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100

242
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,079
episode

243
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,170
you asked about two strains that I've

244
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,279
created called space force and

245
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,199
starstruck well my friend I'm going to

246
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,919
highlight both of those strains we're

247
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,149
going to do two separate episodes again

248
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,199
excuse me for the throat clearing you

249
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,209
guys I'm not even going to edit that

250
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,129
because we're doing video now we're just

251
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,599
gonna keep rolling through it I'm gonna

252
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,939
clear my throat a lot of times because I

253
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,770
took some fat fat dabs earlier but we're

254
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,470
going to do two back-to-back episodes

255
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,199
here that are going to be strain reviews

256
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,509
I feel if I do both of these strains in

257
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,940
one episode the information will get

258
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,279
convoluted and people's brains will mash

259
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,620
the details up into one thing so I've

260
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,000
got to do two separate episodes to do

261
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,549
the two strains for you just to keep

262
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,289
[ __ ] straight for you and for me so in

263
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,319
this episode we are going to review a

264
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:54,740
strain which I created called starstruck

265
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,890
so

266
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,360
let's jump right into it starstruck

267
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:01,179
starstruck is a strain I created what

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,000
were the parents of starstruck

269
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:08,088
starstruck was bred from star dog star

270
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,580
dog female 2 in a rise male let's talk

271
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:14,060
about the star dog first we'll go ladies

272
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,370
first star dog is a cross of Khem 4 and

273
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:18,769
Trez dog so you can tell it's already

274
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,259
got a lot of dog dominant genetics in

275
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,850
there that camphor is one of my

276
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:25,370
favourites to grow a lot of people love

277
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,950
the camphor I did grow the Trez dog it

278
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,389
was a little bit of a pain in the ass it

279
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,040
wasn't my favorite to grow in a

280
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,588
commercial facility if you didn't get it

281
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,939
just right it didn't grow just right for

282
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,580
you it would give you problems if you

283
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,470
over watered over fed if you pissed it

284
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,720
off in any way instead of making one

285
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,910
giant Cola up the middle the other plant

286
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,830
it would do one stick with a little

287
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,419
popcorn but on one side and then a

288
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,399
couple inches away up it would do

289
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,409
another popcorn but just a few golf

290
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,269
balls up the main branch that main Cola

291
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:56,480
would never fill in if you pissed it off

292
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,850
so that was the Trez dog camphor grows

293
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,500
like a [ __ ] savage Kim for is really

294
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,950
easy to grow it grows like a champ

295
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,200
there's a lot of great Terps it's really

296
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,000
bug resistant it's easy to grow I love

297
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,339
Kim for the aroma the flavor the buzz

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,328
it's just a great screen so it is Kim

299
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,790
for to the Trez dog I really it got my

300
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:20,689
attention as a consumer because it's got

301
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:23,208
a really good gassy aroma its gassy it's

302
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,980
funky it's got some earth to it and when

303
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,389
I say that strains have certain aromas

304
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,550
and flavours you have to keep in mind

305
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,620
that different growers in different

306
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:32,599
environments are going to get different

307
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,789
flavours and aromas we can take this

308
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,350
star dog cut and put it in seven grows

309
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:38,179
and we're going to get seven different

310
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,920
flavours but they are all going to have

311
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:45,139
this base of a gas eNOS it's gassy and

312
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,240
skunky and then I notice that when I

313
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,669
grow it in a commercial facility with

314
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,370
new millennium nutrients I do find a

315
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:56,419
little bit of strawberry or watermelon

316
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:59,328
hints to the after flavor so the star is

317
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,009
gas its gassy it's dirty it's funky it's

318
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,989
got a little bit of feet and feel to it

319
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,929
and then you inhale and then as you

320
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,139
exhale there's this this a strawberry

321
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:10,239
watermelon turf to it I just think

322
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,759
and my brain is weird I see flavors and

323
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,159
colors it's a really soft pink color and

324
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,529
flavor it's not bubblegum II but it is

325
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,089
watermelon II and strawberries so that's

326
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,370
my crazy brain description of flavor

327
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,560
it's gassy with hints of watermelon and

328
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,659
strawberry the phenotype that I grew the

329
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,000
grow that I'm familiar with lots of gas

330
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,969
hints of feet lots of watermelon and

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,100
strawberry so that was one of the things

332
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,529
that got my attention and he gets me so

333
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,769
high it gives me a really desirable high

334
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,870
um good head buzz it makes my eyes heavy

335
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,669
it makes me think like some some weeds

336
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,590
some concentrates go to your body some

337
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,269
concentrates give you cottonmouth some

338
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,700
go right to the brain this one hit me in

339
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,769
the eyes and in my head I was high

340
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,270
like it wasn't stoned when I smoked

341
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,370
started out I actually get high and I

342
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,139
smoked a lot so it takes a little bit to

343
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,870
get me really high and I think it's that

344
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:01,179
chem for the Trez dog that chem family

345
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,639
stuff gets to me so I really love the

346
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,099
buzz when you grow it you see a lot of

347
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,870
trichomes a lot of trichomes they start

348
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,879
popping up early they coat the plant

349
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,679
they get really thick on the plant lots

350
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,200
of trichomes the starter dog makes great

351
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,179
concentrates apothecary farms makes a

352
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,310
star dog batter that if they've got a

353
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,559
four gram jar of it I will take it every

354
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:22,539
time it's on the shelf I love that star

355
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,469
dog batter so it makes a lot of

356
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,649
trichomes

357
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,660
star dog has a really good structure

358
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,039
except for sometimes if it doesn't get

359
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,409
enough light if you don't have enough

360
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,839
wind the bottom branches will grow

361
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:37,120
sideways instead of up they start going

362
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,740
horizontally instead of vertically they

363
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,480
try to get out to the end of the plant

364
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,129
then they go up so they can get away

365
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,930
from the rest of the branches and get

366
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,460
that light so sometimes if you don't

367
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,120
have enough light it can be a little bit

368
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,070
of a [ __ ]

369
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,360
most of the time it's an amazing grower

370
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,310
it's really good to grow in my opinion

371
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,070
in a commercial environment growing star

372
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,750
dog if I had if I had to get a bonus if

373
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,610
we were kind of if we had an issue in

374
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,830
the previous grow star dog is how I

375
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,600
would make up for it in the next grow if

376
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,980
we wanted to get a bonus if we wanted to

377
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,680
fill a room with something we knew would

378
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,720
kick ass if we had a 420 sale coming and

379
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,759
we needed a lot of product fill a room

380
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,519
with star dog it will please you you'll

381
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,259
get a lot of quality product and it's

382
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,579
really easy to grow it doesn't make you

383
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,990
don't make mistakes with it it's

384
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,759
forgiving us what I think I'm trying to

385
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,710
say if you make a mistake and

386
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,389
bounce back you can overwater it you can

387
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,060
overfeed it and it won't be too pissed

388
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,980
off it's really good for commercial

389
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,779
growing it kicks out great lab tests the

390
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,360
potency the Terps are always great in

391
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,529
the labs it never ever had any problems

392
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,930
it's got amazing

393
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,329
bag appeal the shapes of the buds are

394
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,669
beautiful they're nice and dense but not

395
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,830
too dense to wear the bags look small um

396
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:46,539
it just it sells once you put it in a

397
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,970
jar and put it on the shelf the colors

398
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:51,309
the bag appeal to smell people want it

399
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,710
they see that lab tests on it uh high

400
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,989
20s low 30s and the numbers people

401
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,240
really want that I really found Starlog

402
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,919
to be an excellent commercial strain you

403
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,019
can tell I drew it a lot I fell in love

404
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,699
with it it was one of my favorites the

405
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:05,259
commercial grow guys couldn't mess it up

406
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,300
we had plants in that commercial grow

407
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:09,250
like the Trez dog they could kill that

408
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,199
one the star dog it would just survive

409
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,059
through everything if they messed up so

410
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,460
I love growing the star dog

411
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:17,889
I can make bonuses I love to smoke it it

412
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,530
was a grower and a smokers dream it was

413
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:22,240
a commercial cultivators best friend we

414
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,949
could grow a lot of it it didn't take a

415
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,629
lot of time it would put out really well

416
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,700
and then once it hit the Shelf it would

417
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:31,419
disappear so that is star dog

418
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,300
I took my mail a Ryze plant I've got a

419
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:36,009
male a rise plant known as King Solomon

420
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:38,259
if you listen to my podcast a lot you've

421
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,769
learned all about King Solomon King

422
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:45,549
Solomon is a very unique selected male

423
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:47,889
cultivar of arise arise his golden goat

424
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,579
to Daybreaker golden goat is Island

425
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:54,370
sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa and Romulan

426
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,660
Daybreaker is CEM D and Joseph OG I did

427
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,250
that without looking at my notes I'm

428
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:59,740
proud of myself so I took a really

429
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,379
tropical sativa dominant type of a plant

430
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,950
and I pollinated or that was pollinated

431
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:07,689
by an OG Kush chem dog combination plant

432
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,450
so I had tropical sweet flavors and

433
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,550
those dank stinky skunky earthy savory

434
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,759
flavors I crossed that and that made

435
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,469
arise there isn't a rise phenotype that

436
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,179
is known as a rise number four because

437
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,240
it was number four in the garden it

438
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:24,459
tests very high in THC my friend miles

439
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,470
in New Mexico grew out and a rise plant

440
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,200
and he tested that plant at thirty five

441
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,720
point eight four percent THC a this

442
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,050
plant is known to put out amazing lab

443
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,810
numbers very high THC results when I

444
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,419
used the

445
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:41,089
he'll arise plan everything I pollinate

446
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:43,490
with that plant becomes better than it

447
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,580
was before so there wasn't anything

448
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,590
wrong with the star dog plant I just

449
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,750
thought that by pollinating it with my

450
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,149
arise plant that I could probably make

451
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,980
something bigger faster and better

452
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:58,549
because that is what it is known for I

453
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,080
feel like I mostly mostly that word was

454
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:03,469
hard for my face to say I feel like I'm

455
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,230
mostly hit my goal except for too many

456
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,800
phenotypes of this cross are just

457
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,960
remakes of the star dog so most of them

458
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,729
a lot of them come out just like star

459
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,190
dog I didn't make anything too different

460
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,050
a lot of them are star dog dominant but

461
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,400
they grow a little bit more quickly some

462
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:22,189
of them are star dog with sweeter

463
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,500
flavors and aromas but unfortunately I

464
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,000
like what I made I mean it kicks ass

465
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,220
it's a really great cross but I was

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,110
trying to do something new and it mostly

467
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,210
came out like one of the parent plants

468
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,980
which I understand why if you look at

469
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,170
the genetics if you look at King Solomon

470
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,810
there is candy in there so there's chem

471
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:41,029
dog in King Solomon there's chem dog in

472
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,769
the star dog there's chem for there's

473
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,929
Trez dog there's a lot of chem happening

474
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,338
so it was all already kind of put

475
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,199
together all of my ingredients already

476
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,780
tasted like Kent looked and smelled like

477
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,700
Kemp so it came out very camp but I do

478
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,740
get a lot of trichome development I do

479
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,379
get a lot of hyper vigor and I do get

480
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,450
some really unique phenotypes now let's

481
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,169
talk a little bit more about star struck

482
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,240
here ah

483
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:05,059
the outcome was perfect it's a really

484
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,890
great commercial plant it is a better

485
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,938
commercial plant than the star dog was

486
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,220
it grows more quickly

487
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,529
it makes larger buds some of the

488
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,110
phenotypes flower longer but some of the

489
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:16,549
phenotypes flower more quickly so if

490
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,838
you're looking for a great commercial

491
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,220
plant and you can't get your hands on

492
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,990
the star dog or you want something

493
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,539
different the star struck would be

494
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,420
perfect for you it is very p.m.

495
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,670
resistant it is very bug resistant I've

496
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,509
noticed that many phenotypes do not get

497
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,039
bugs it puts out really big fat friendly

498
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,079
yields that's why I said earlier it is

499
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,149
great for a commercial production if you

500
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,490
just need to put out fat weight this is

501
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,650
the plant for you the aromas are

502
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,710
beautiful like I said it's very much

503
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,870
like star dog it's got that gassy we've

504
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,778
got so much chem going on in here we've

505
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,788
got Joseph's og that it's got back

506
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,440
see feet thing then a lot of the

507
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,419
phenotypes because of the golden goat

508
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,679
side of the arise you're gonna get that

509
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:57,940
sweetness and that you're gonna get that

510
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,950
watermelon you're gonna get some

511
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,570
strawberries we even get some sort of

512
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,058
grapefruits sort of Terps coming out of

513
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:05,950
some of these there are a lot of really

514
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:09,339
cool phenotypes but again most of them

515
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,169
are going to be star dog dominant and

516
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,378
that is why I'm just gonna drop this now

517
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:16,450
that is why I discontinued making star

518
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:19,988
struck seats there are still star struts

519
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,609
T star struck seeds available you say it

520
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:24,009
don't stutter I dare you there are

521
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:25,868
starstruck seeds still available at many

522
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:29,319
vendors but I will not be making them

523
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:32,259
anymore mainly because I didn't do

524
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:35,168
anything to new it came out very star

525
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:37,149
star dog dominant and there are plenty

526
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,460
of other breeders out there working with

527
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:41,319
star dog star dog is not across I made

528
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,269
that was made by somebody else I'll let

529
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,189
that breeder work with that and do that

530
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,169
work I'm gonna stop playing with it

531
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,599
I did what I wanted to do it's a great

532
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,879
cross also for some reason it never took

533
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:53,678
off I advertised it we talked about it I

534
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:55,478
just never really went anywhere I'm sure

535
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,940
after this episode comes out a few more

536
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:59,409
packs will move but other fur I don't

537
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,419
know how some strains really gain

538
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,919
traction and some really don't I guess

539
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:05,440
their hitters are they're not but the

540
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,269
star struck nobody cared they advertised

541
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,099
it I put it out nobody bought it so it's

542
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:10,298
gonna be discontinued to make room for

543
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,579
things that maybe somebody will be

544
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:14,168
interested in also make room for new art

545
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,728
I'm kind of I think being a breeder I'm

546
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:17,440
kind of an artist I guess you might want

547
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,848
to call me that I need to get rid of

548
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,769
that old artwork and work on a new

549
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:22,538
project so the star dog will go bye-bye

550
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:25,088
so that we can work on new things

551
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,888
nothing against it it's a great plant i

552
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:29,079
bred to it I love it I love the outcome

553
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:30,668
but I don't need to make more star dog

554
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,858
crosses when there are plenty of

555
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,778
breeders out there making plenty of

556
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,788
start out crosses the guy that made star

557
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:39,069
dog has plenty of out crosses I'll let

558
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,419
him have his plant just respect do your

559
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,979
thing bro I don't need to step on that

560
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,929
where are we

561
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:47,139
it's too much like star dog the flavors

562
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,028
gas strawberries I wrote down feet some

563
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:51,069
of the phenotypes smell like feet some

564
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:53,409
of them get that rubber tire smell a lot

565
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,588
of people say that chem dog dominant

566
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,970
crosses have a tire shop sort of a smell

567
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:59,408
I don't know how many hours you spent

568
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,778
the tire shop but the next time you go

569
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,550
your tires change think about what those

570
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:06,549
tires smell like also sometime

571
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,319
it smells like new generic shoes not

572
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:11,259
good shoes but like good cheap shoes it

573
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,639
smells like good new cheap shoes some of

574
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,629
them smell like fresh tennis balls I

575
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,980
don't know if you've ever opened a can

576
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,390
of tennis balls and smelled that weird

577
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,370
smell that comes out of there it's kind

578
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,140
of a rubbery chemical sort of a smell

579
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:22,569
but some of the phenotypes will have

580
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,450
that aroma to them now let's talk about

581
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:27,549
the buzz that comes from starstruck I

582
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,500
talked earlier how I love the buzz from

583
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,259
starstruck I feel it if I take a dad

584
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,250
from starstruck I feel my eyes just go

585
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,019
it's like somebody just pushed a button

586
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,059
to close the garage door and my eyes get

587
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:39,970
real heavy they get real bright red

588
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:42,309
again a nice buzz from it I get stoned I

589
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,990
get high I get like I don't know it does

590
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,789
something a lot of concentrates make me

591
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,440
normal this one doesn't make me normal

592
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,069
it [ __ ] me up and that's what I'm

593
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,049
looking for

594
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:52,359
it'll give me the giggles I can get that

595
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,710
weird grin people that have been smoking

596
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,969
a long time it takes you a minute but

597
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,069
once you get there you get that [ __ ]

598
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,440
silly grin on your face star dog will

599
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:00,909
give me that stupid grin that stoned

600
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,380
grin that like Willy what are you

601
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,090
thinking about bro I don't even know but

602
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm just [ __ ] smiling dude on this

603
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:09,220
stone and it's good I've noticed if I

604
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,859
smoke too many dad's of the star-struck

605
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,259
I can time-travel I can get into a

606
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:16,539
little bubble and I can come out of that

607
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,640
bubble and it's been the full day but

608
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,500
also in that little bubble I may have

609
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,940
like completely rearranged the house I

610
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,799
don't know how well I rearranged it but

611
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,779
I did it completely rearrange the house

612
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,700
maybe I organized all my seed packages

613
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,490
maybe I tuned up the whole drum set but

614
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,380
it really can put you into a huge bubble

615
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,480
if you smoke too much of the starstruck

616
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,010
so now let's talk more about the growth

617
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,259
characteristics we've talked about

618
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:39,549
consuming it let's talk about growing

619
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,809
this plant this is the part where all

620
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,190
the growers are gonna want to pay

621
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,849
attention um

622
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,920
starstruck can take heavy feeds she

623
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:50,230
likes to be fed a lot all of the plants

624
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,660
in this cross are very heavy feeders so

625
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,809
she can take a lot of food later in

626
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,960
Flour she will want extra cal-mag she

627
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,509
takes topping popping twisting and abuse

628
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,180
very well if you want a twister popper

629
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:06,039
hold her down put it in a screen put it

630
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,170
in a tomato cage anything like that it

631
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,480
will take all of that very well also

632
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,460
this plant clones very well I've noticed

633
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,380
that most of the time the starstruck

634
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,509
clones root a little more quickly than

635
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,470
some of the other clones out as very

636
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:20,048
p.m. resist

637
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,839
that is also resistant to bugs it will

638
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:25,089
take a lot of co2 if you pump up the co2

639
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,579
this plant will continue to grow in a

640
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:29,168
commercial environment I really cranked

641
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,579
up the co2 I'm not even going to tell

642
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,200
you the numbers that I hit because some

643
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,819
of that management may here and they

644
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,038
will not be happy at how much co2 I'm

645
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,359
cranking we go [ __ ] crazy and the

646
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,129
star dog plants love it

647
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,609
the starstruck plants go [ __ ] crazy

648
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:45,370
so star dog star-struck loves the

649
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,479
[ __ ] co2 ah they will get big buds

650
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:48,399
that will need some help

651
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,650
and some support I say that about many

652
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,690
of the crosses that I breed anything

653
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,309
that comes from King Solomon is going to

654
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,169
need support if you think these plants

655
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:59,230
will hold themselves up you're crazy it

656
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,820
will need sticks tomato cages or trellis

657
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,000
or something like that you're gonna get

658
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:07,418
big fat buds from the star-struck be

659
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,029
prepared for that umm these plants do

660
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,090
stretch I'm going to say expect double

661
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,740
the height by the end of flower most of

662
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,839
these plants are gonna have that classic

663
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,370
Christmas tree structure like I said

664
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,199
earlier some of the bottom branches are

665
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:22,029
going to stretch out really horizontally

666
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,319
and try to get away from the branches

667
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,849
above them to where they can get more

668
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,649
light you may want to do some

669
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:28,869
defoliation these plants take very well

670
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,090
to defoliation pull out those extra

671
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,250
leaves get that light down there that'll

672
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:35,649
help you minimize the stretch also crack

673
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,210
pop and twist it the first two weeks of

674
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,730
flower that will definitely help slow

675
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,460
down that aggressive stretching but you

676
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,038
may see they may double in height I

677
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,529
think I said that they do like a pH

678
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,750
somewhere between six point two and six

679
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:51,369
point four they handle temperature

680
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,750
swings very well

681
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:54,849
I've had this plant in a commercial

682
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,650
environment I've had the star struck and

683
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,329
the star dog both in commercial

684
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,788
environments and they both handle

685
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:02,109
temperature swings very well of course

686
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:04,000
in a commercial environment there are

687
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:06,158
always equipment failures and that's how

688
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,990
you get to learn what good plants take

689
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,309
the temperature problems and that's how

690
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,870
we learned it so I've got a good

691
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:12,940
experience there I know it will take

692
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:15,308
temperature swings alright now let's

693
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,808
talk about some of the pheno types that

694
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:20,139
you're going to find when you were

695
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:22,808
growing starstruck plants most of them

696
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,630
like I keep saying they look mostly like

697
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:28,460
star dog to up not a super

698
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,670
thick branch not a really wispy branch a

699
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,740
medium-sized main apical meristem then

700
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,600
we get long branching on the bottom then

701
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,099
we get let it's Christmas tree shape

702
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,869
those bottom branches kind of just want

703
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,429
to stretch out so they can get the white

704
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:42,469
because they're being blocked from above

705
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,539
instead of growing straight up they grow

706
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,490
completely horizontal then once they get

707
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,409
past the branch above them then they

708
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,710
curve up so they've got that classic

709
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,900
Christmas tree shape to them um you will

710
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,789
see some thin leaved

711
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,410
freaks and that is coming from the

712
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,359
golden go that is probably from the

713
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,430
island sweet skunk or the Hawaiian

714
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,169
sativa those are not my favorite

715
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,900
phenotypes those take a little bit

716
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,340
longer they don't have that gassy funky

717
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,950
flavor they start getting a little bit

718
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,959
more sweet flavor to it but those do

719
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,180
have more of a psychedelic head buzz if

720
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,529
you get those longer-lasting plants

721
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,509
those are more of a psychedelic head

722
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:19,730
buzz although they are not my favorite

723
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:21,379
if I'm growing starstruck I probably

724
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,539
want the one that looks a little bit

725
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,250
more like star dog it's got a wider leaf

726
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,500
it almost looks like a maple leaf that

727
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,210
looks like the Canadian flag that is the

728
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,609
leaf I'm looking for when I'm growing

729
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,559
star dog or starstruck I want that star

730
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:37,409
dog dominant phenotype that is the

731
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:39,000
commercial growers dream so

732
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,350
skinny leaves are gonna be more sativa

733
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,910
dominant they're gonna take a little bit

734
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,490
longer they're definitely going to get

735
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,500
stretchier and get much taller I don't

736
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,970
keep those around if you choose to keep

737
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,130
that grow the [ __ ] out of it

738
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,900
let it go about ten weeks you will enjoy

739
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,530
it but I prefer the bigger leaved

740
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,210
phenotype um d foliate if you get these

741
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:59,369
bigger leaf phenotypes you're going to

742
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,990
have to defoliate and control the canopy

743
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:02,849
they will get large leaves that will

744
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,319
block the light pull that off there if

745
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:06,689
you started seeing purple pee Deol's

746
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,399
get that leaf off of there it's not a

747
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,590
problem if you get the purple pee Deol's

748
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,780
also some of the phenotypes will get

749
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:14,730
really large leaves they're just droop

750
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,230
they won't go up no matter how much you

751
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,029
water that plant no matter how much

752
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,220
light you give it some of those big

753
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,809
super big leaves are going to droop that

754
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,490
is a trait that comes from Daybreaker

755
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,389
that is not a problem you're not doing

756
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,519
anything wrong

757
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,320
the Daybreaker makes giant leaves and

758
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,420
some of the phenotypes they just hang

759
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,339
down they don't want to go up they're so

760
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,380
big that they can't support themselves

761
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:37,349
you're not doing anything wrong that is

762
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,630
just the plant you can defoliation the

763
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:41,669
way they'll get huge take some pictures

764
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,100
some of these plants are going to get

765
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,620
stinky really early the ones that start

766
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,719
putting off a watermelon turb early that

767
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:52,019
will turn into fuel and feet later on

768
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,269
that is a good sign she goes fast so be

769
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,519
ready you may need to flip early you may

770
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:57,900
need to flower a week earlier than you

771
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,059
do with most of your plants if you're

772
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,040
not taking out that main apical top

773
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,440
these plants are gonna get tall maybe

774
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,289
flower a little bit earlier now let's

775
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,029
talk about flowering times most of the

776
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:12,299
phenotypes are gonna flower in nine

777
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:15,420
weeks you will find ten week phenotypes

778
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,069
I like the 63-65 a phenotype it is

779
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,950
perfect for a commercial environment

780
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:22,500
that 10 weaker will get tall on you so

781
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,980
you may see some more dense tighter buds

782
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,750
that is the star struck star dog

783
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,849
dominant phenotype that you want you'll

784
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,099
see some area fluffier buts that is the

785
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,299
one I don't keep but that is also the

786
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,609
one that's going to give you that

787
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,680
psychedelic head buzz the titer blood

788
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:40,529
plant will probably go about nine weeks

789
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,390
some will go ten but area fluffier want

790
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:44,639
the stretchy want that little [ __ ] can

791
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,890
go ten or eleven weeks I've never let it

792
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,020
go longer because I don't like it I cut

793
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,610
it down I get rid of it that is not what

794
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,240
I wanted from this project so it just

795
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:53,369
gets removed

796
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,200
from the room not my favorite if I

797
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,839
wanted to grow a golden goat dominant

798
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,170
plant I would grow golden so I remove

799
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,740
that little [ __ ] from the room now I've

800
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,929
said it before

801
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,120
this plant is discontinued don't be

802
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:07,710
afraid or this seed line is discontinued

803
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,719
don't be afraid to pick up seeds just

804
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,579
because I don't make them anymore I said

805
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,230
that I don't make it because the first

806
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,299
fact is nobody is buying it I can't make

807
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,370
seeds that are going to sell second of

808
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:20,099
all there is somebody making plenty of

809
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:22,558
star dog crosses but if you want

810
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,689
something that is a star dog cross cross

811
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,869
to arise that has got the potential for

812
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,850
really impressive THC numbers I I can

813
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:33,479
almost promise you that you will find a

814
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:35,339
32 or higher percent THC plant in these

815
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,589
seeds if you search through it if you've

816
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,808
got access to a lab if you grow properly

817
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:40,589
if you give these things all of the love

818
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,109
and care they deserve

819
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:45,899
you'll get 32 percent THC out of a

820
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:48,839
phenotype of starstruck I've seen that

821
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,700
and higher from star dog I've seen that

822
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,069
and higher from a rise I know together

823
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,259
they will be back I want to see your lab

824
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:57,539
tests so I think that's all I've got for

825
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,730
you guys when it comes to starstruck

826
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,720
it's a wonderful cross I keep saying

827
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,160
that it's great for commercial

828
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,870
production if you've got a commercial

829
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,519
grow and you want to put some I read

830
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,859
genetics in there I would put some

831
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,150
starstruck and some strawberry starburst

832
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:11,099
in there and you would have two

833
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,290
wonderful flavours and aromas and you

834
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,699

835
