157
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:09,009
the rig in one hand he put the dab onto

158
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:10,449
the nail and he put his mouth on to the

159
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,219
microphone and tried to inhale through

160
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:16,840
the microphone yep took a big ol head

161

167
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,680
why the smoke wasn't coming through they

168
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,810
stared at the microphone for a second

169
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,230

229
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,889
they said and CBD concentrate goes to

230

and they said Oh jito and before they

231
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,278
finished the name of the strain I threw

232
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:22,909

237
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,300

238
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,789

planned for that which one Oh which one

249
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:55,549
well it's all thinking about Denver but

250
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:57,349
fortunately family just got canceled if

251
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,799
we are lucky enough to have a cup of

252
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,240
Denver I'll do it but I just with the

253
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,949
way everything's going I don't think

254
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,750
that's gonna last much longer that's

255
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,670
true unless it's like in like I know

256
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,440
like Jamaica that'll be fine they're not

257
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:14,059
gonna touch Jamaica because it's in a

258
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,709
different country it's our first time

259
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:19,189
they've already approved that yeah

260
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:20,359
Meghan councilman I think Michigan I was

261
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,089
looking on the website today and

262
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,669
Michigan has theirs either Michigan you

263
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,610
know its California the one in LA that

264
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:32,149
they do February of every year but see

265
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,889
Mike um is going to have a two weekend

266
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,019
so it's gonna be one weekend and then

267
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,610
like I don't know what they're doing the

268
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,100
entire week and then the next weekend

269
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,720
it's like so you know things are

270
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,740
changing with like different states

271
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,620
China hello hi times I think it just

272
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,700
comes down to it like probably how much

273
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,339
money you want to put into it which

274
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,420
they're probably still paying a

275
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:55,250
ridiculous amount to you know get

276
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,860
locations and stuff

277
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,299
just when you know at cannabis cup just

278
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,550
usually like people giving away samples

279
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:04,429
and stuff like that like that's money

280
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:06,169
that the tax people don't see so that's

281
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:07,250
something and it's actually written in

282
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,659
the rules that they can't give out

283
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,399
samples and [ __ ] at events like that

284
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:17,029
yeah is it that nobody can give out

285
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,309
samples or only established shops with

286
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,929
licenses can't give out samples the

287
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,359
problem is when the established shops

288
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:27,829
were giving out licenses but I heard a

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,600
police officer say that he said shops

290
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,070
giving out license I didn't say that huh

291
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,509
licensed shop giving out samples away

292
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,470
that man sorry but then I wanted to talk

293
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,899
about something else that I heard I

294
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,470
heard a cop say today that if I give you

295
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,669
cannabis even if I gave it to you

296
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,160
legally that's a sale there was a

297
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,679
transaction there that was considered a

298
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,789
sale even if it's a donation so there's

299
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,759
a lot to be careful about yeah

300
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,929
technically that's a sale interesting I

301
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,149
guess that would just be at the cops

302
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:55,639
discretion that's exactly what that cop

303
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,779
said yep yeah so if they want to be a

304
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,850
dick about it they can go ahead and

305
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,259
arrest you for me give arrest both of us

306
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,820
me for giving it to you and you for

307
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,470
accepting it even though we're both over

308
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,080
21 go ahead so I grab the microphone

309
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,759
[Music]

310
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,230
there we go what about like how does

311
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,980
that work though because we can smoke

312
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,920
with each other

313
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:21,110
that's very true leaves with anything

314
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,329
right because yeah I mean technically

315
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,000
like the definition of a sale is like

316
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,520
Mike you're the legal guy for step in

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,839
Mike Wow I don't give direct legal

318
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:35,120
advice really just we need more Pro

319
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,740
marijuana laws the federal law needs to

320
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,509
change state laws need to change

321
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,360
I mean marijuana is legal here we have

322
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:44,779
pot stores we still can't gather outside

323
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,940
of someone's private residence and

324
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,539
consumed together legally all of that

325
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,550
still in a gray market people are busted

326
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:54,379
for distribution for passing joints or

327
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,259

regulated guys yeah then you have to fax

490
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,369
that to the meed like 24 hours before

491
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,109
you leave and they have to approve it

492
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,849
and then when you get the product there

493
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,740
you have to basically do the opposite of

494
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,730
everything your son by the other people

495
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,700
yeah

496
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,549
Jordan Wade and then fact that it was

497
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,200
received yeah so they really track all

498
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,519
of the product here in Colorado they pay

499
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,950
a lot of attention they called the seed

500
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,869
to sale model from the minute that we

501
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,029
germinate a seed in the shop it's under

502
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:15,239
camera and it has a MIPS number and an

503
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:17,399
RFID and it'll be that RFID until

504
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,019
harvest time and when it gets tested

505
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,670
because everything has to be tested when

506
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,129
it does get a test it'll be tested under

507
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:34,230
that RFID number there was just another

508
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:39,140
bunch of recalls today I had two number

509
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,140
two two dispensers and ever gave product

510
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:45,929
pesticide whatever to another two bunch

511
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
of extract companies and it was

512
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,060
literally probably almost every extract

513
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,750
company like bigger extract company

514
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:57,119
Denver I had to return I only had time

515
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,130
to scan that one before today's meet the

516
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:04,139
list is stuff that's getting recalled is

517
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:07,070
big work do they do the customers I've

518
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,170
purchased it to check their product

519
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:11,759
entry if they purchase their exchange or

520
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,380
a refund all the products have a batch

521
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,319
number on it so you they can identify

522
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,290
like which batch it is so if you look on

523
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:23,970
your jar and it has blah blah blah blah

524
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:30,420
and then hopefully it already there's

525
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:31,860
also two lawsuits for people who but

526
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,330
it's gonna be years before these people

527
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,859
find out if they got sick from any of

528
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,449
the things that they smoked and then how

529
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,099
can you say that it was this batch of

530
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,519
hash right here they got you sick after

531

538
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,289
generation in this movement that does

539
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:57,929
discover it but I have to say either way

540

571
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,329
give him a shout-out for the time that

572
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,949
he did have to go lay down on the show

573
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:30,990

574
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:33,390
green on the couch over there shut up -

575
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,890

576
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,690
like I killed the man I felt kind of bad

577
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,850

578
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,170

579

580
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,910

581
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,859

that

586
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,230
over here to the little hit man because

587
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,379
it hits a little better in my opinion

588
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,380
gives you a little meaner rip that's

589
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,880
that's pretty nice for a fee right for a

590
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,530
mother ship knock on door mother [ __ ]

00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,069
wasn't twenty five hundred bucks and it

599
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:29,099
hits just like a mother ship so it was

600
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:31,918
worth the 250 or 200 or whatever it's

601
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,178

656
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:02,309
and then I took a bunch of oil and put

657
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,250
it on a hot plate to get it like melted

658
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:07,889
down and equity and then I rolled the

659
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,680
nug around in it and dropped it in a

660
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:14,100
mason jar full of Keef that I got from a

661
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,170
pollen box and I shook the [ __ ] out of

662
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:19,409

692
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:36,369

00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:48,898
nice Pixar movie my first time taking

823
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,338
acid I might have taken a little bit too

824
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:57,630
much from what I remember I was with the

825
00:34:50,338 --> 00:35:01,139
girl what's the biggest dab you've ever

826
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,200
taken sloppy um I'm pretty sure our

827
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:07,828
friend Michael gave me like a gram dab

828
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:09,929
one side I did a gram at the Cannabis

829
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:11,160
Cup and won a t-shirt and I almost threw

830
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:12,929
up almost threw up

831
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,149
I've almost thrown up both times the one

832
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:17,129
time that Michael did it was during the

833
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,108
Super Bowl and I literally took the dab

834
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,640
stood up in the middle of his house took

835
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:22,639
my shirt off and lay down on the floor

836
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:27,498
yeah sometimes you just need a little

837
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:30,509
rest her after a big dab like that I

838
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:31,919
think if there were to be a dad contest

839
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:33,869
in the room I think the last two

840
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,239
standards would probably be myself and

841
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:39,329
Maddie Oh I'll be the first person out

842
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,039
yeah yes it says no no shame in saying

843
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,380
he does not take big dabs he likes take

844
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:47,940
a whole bunch of little dabs and then

845
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,499
his eyes turn as red his stop lights he

846
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,940
just he looked into the microphone and

847
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:53,189

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,769
summer before my 10th grade we were

894
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,129
playing in a basketball tournament and I

895
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:59,079
literally caught a ball took two steps

896
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,630
and jumped over a kid that was like I

897
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,069
mean it's probably like 6 foot like I'm

898
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,700
in tenth grade I literally just Vince

899
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:09,130
Carter Dover this dude like the referees

900
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:11,369
were like alumni players players who'd

901
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,480
just come back for summer for money

902
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:16,420
literally they just take off running out

903
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:21,750
of the gym the referees are like holy

904
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:24,000
[ __ ] he just jumped over somebody like I

905
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,519
was really athletic but I think I'm uh

906
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,449
always like tweet it was never like

907
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,860
besides when I was younger it was only

908
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:31,539
time I didn't really smoke but once I

909
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,849
got into like high school and like

910
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,130
college I continued I had two

911
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,929
scholarships I was still smoking we can

912
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,880
you hoop in your high yeah I think I

913
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:41,789
play better when Am I it's like it slows

914
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,320
down yeah yeah so fast music

915
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:46,829
I don't know sometime it might be I'm

916
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,150
slowed down but you can shoot better

917
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:50,130
right it's a little more aim a little

918
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,780
like you get normally time is going by

919
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,140
about tick tick tick but when you smoke

920
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,200
some weed

921
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:57,089

922

923

Joe musician when you're playing music

926
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,380
you could just feel the time so much

927
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,940
better when you're a little high it

928
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,590
feels like that beat is so much thicker

929
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,000

grade my school was a fifth grade

951
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,590
through twelfth grade in one school cuz

952
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,059
the community was small and I didn't

953
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,380
really know what the big kids were doing

954
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,630
but they asked me if I wanted to smoke

955
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,579
and I said yes and I went to my friend

956
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,829
demetria's his house and we went to his

957
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,269
shed and played Sega Genesis and smoke

958
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:29,190
blunts while his grandma cooked us

959
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:34,860
chicken and I remember it sounded like a

960

Chappelle show so to be specific and it

961
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,970

964
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,880

966
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,710
one of the first games on Sega Genesis

967
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,169

968
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,730
time and it was funny because I I was so

969

young that I didn't know what I did was

970
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:58,159

don't eat anything when you get home and

973
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,789
go in your room and tell your mom you

974
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,799
have a headache

975
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:07,380
and house like ah this seems weird like

976
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,300
you know but that was everyday and

977
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,579
eventually my mom was like why do you

978
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,980
have so many headaches life is too good

979
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,029
with you enjoying yourself so you didn't

980
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,460
even know that you were doing something

981
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:25,710
bad uh I mean my mom smoked cigarettes I

982
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,630
saw people smoking but nah I was just

983
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,789
like I wanted to be a cool kid it was

984
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,250
fifth through twelfth grade I was there

985
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:35,369
with all older kids it was a minority

986
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,349
school I got integrated into so it was

987
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,519
just like you know being the oddball out

988
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,588
I was like well that's what they're

989
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,030
doing let's right yeah and then I did it

990
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:51,989
and play those video games and I was

991
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:53,280
like this is the [ __ ] nice nice does

992
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,689
anybody else want to tell about the

993
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
first time they got high you don't have

994
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,050
to if you don't want to Joe I went here

995
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,059
do it if you want to you let's hear it

996
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:03,420
that's pretty basic story I was

997
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:06,809
interested in it friends one day some

998
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,460
people came with weed got smoked and I

999
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:11,969
was like okay this is interesting I can

1000
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,250
see why people enjoy this and just kind

1001
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:18,239
of have ever since how old were you you

1002
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:19,980
don't mind me asking okay but that

1003
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,529
seemed about an appropriate age to start

1004
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,440
smoking but it wasn't like the first

1005
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,180
year was really sporadic just like here

1006
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,088
and there it was just like a curiosity

1007
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:33,690
okay it got settled and then after that

1008
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:37,349
then I became interested in more than

1009
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:40,920
just weed as a cool after-school

1010
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:45,390
activity so some other things took its

1011
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,940
place I guess so okay but yeah that's

1012
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:49,230
all that's all for that that's all look

1013
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,329
on your face not to go further with that

1014
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,619
question miss Maddie do you want to tell

1015
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:54,119
us about the first time that you got to

1016
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,880
experience a play with the wonderful

1017
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,070
world of ganja and cannabis I was really

1018
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,369
really young I can't really say my story

1019
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:04,980
on a podcast because I'm afraid that

1020
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:08,400
might not go so well but I was really

1021
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,990
young I was like 13 when I like started

1022
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,329
smoking weed like once or twice a week

1023
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:17,069
yeah Spencer just pointed out that

1024
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:21,000
sloppy said fifth grade man he's afraid

1025
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:22,710
to tell her story but okay I think I

1026
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,090
know why I think yeah that's gotta

1027
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,670
respect ya

1028
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,160
word all right - how old were you I was

1029
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,139
young I was like 13 when I started I

1030
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,149
probably smoked weed before that I start

1031
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,940
smoking cigarettes and stuff I grew up

1032
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:42,329
in like a trailer park so you know it

1033
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:44,670
was kind of like really really young so

1034
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:46,349
when weed was introduced to me it wasn't

1035
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,070
even like a question I thought it was

1036
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:51,329
just something normal

1037
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,559
it's just like sloppy like just didn't

1038
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,019
really realize what I was doing was

1039
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,909
wrong and I remember one day I sat in a

1040
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:58,440
dare class because in North Carolina you

1041
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:01,980
have to go through dare classes which is

1042
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,530
a drug awareness drug abuse resistance

1043
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,210
education there we go and they were

1044
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:10,550
talking about they were talking about

1045
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,550
marijuana and they're saying how awful

1046
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,650
all right spits you know you're up next

1047
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:27,059
what's the first time do you what do you

1048
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,700
remember about the first time you smoked

1049
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,500
some weed I think I smoked weed I like a

1050
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:34,289
spray bottle when I was in like ninth

1051
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,170
grade I don't even didn't even know what

1052
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:39,900
getting high was so I didn't know what I

1053
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,720
was feeling I was like oh I guess I

1054
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,869
guess I'm high oh no and then I didn't

1055
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,669
really touch weed until I was like oh

1056
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:50,699
maybe sophomore at the next year's when

1057
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:54,300
I was like actually smoking it's not

1058
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:55,739
like everyday but two three times a week

1059
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,539
I guess yeah whenever someone's got the

1060
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,549
weed whatever comes up Friday night or

1061
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:01,309
whatever I think my interest changed

1062
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,680
when

1063
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:06,199
there I found out about good.we when I

1064
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,210

1065
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,460

1066
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:15,079

1070
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,650

1071
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:26,000
good friend I was like in North Carolina

1072
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,420
where we lived at the time was really

1073
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,760
hard to find weed so I got some from him

1074
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,320
and it was like super super it was the

1075
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,210
best weed I'd ever seen like me and my

1076
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,980
friend were freaking out like we started

1077
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:41,449
smoking it wasn't it was just like some

1078
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,340
really good stuff for where we were at

1079
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:45,169
and we just started hanging out after

1080
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,410
that but that we'd put you two together

1081
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:54,769
yep how cute if you had a had probably

1082
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:56,539
had bad weed I don't know that good

1083
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:58,519
we've got you a good girl bro nice work

1084
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:59,989
nice work all right Mike we're gonna

1085
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:01,039
shift over to you bro when's the first

1086
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:03,949
time you ever smoked some weed

1087
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,099
well we thought we were smoking weed

1088
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:10,250
when we were like 12 but now what it was

1089
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:12,110
either the worst ditch weed ever or more

1090
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,539
than likely it was just what some older

1091
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:16,880
kids that sold us as weed and was

1092
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,820
actually mostly tobacco and like some

1093
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,340
oregano

1094
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:25,580
Podcast but the first time I got like

1095
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,519
really high a friend of mine after

1096
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,019
school when I was like 15 was like hey

1097
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,329
you want to go smoke and I was like sure

1098
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,739
and I thought they meant cigarettes and

1099
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,210
we got in her car and drove off and I

1100
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:36,559
was like this is kind of ridiculous I

1101
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,340
thought you were gonna go around the

1102
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,340
block what the hell is happening

1103
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:46,310
and we went to her garage and got stoned

1104
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,090
and it was the first time I'd ever

1105
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:52,219
smoked good we called it red hair which

1106
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,990
i think is yeah now that I know what I

1107
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:55,369
know about marijuana like we had no

1108
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:57,250
[ __ ] clue what we were doing we were

1109
00:46:55,369 --> 00:47:00,679
just happy to have weed that was good

1110
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,829
and I was stoned out of my mind and by

1111
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:05,829
this point in my life I had sat through

1112
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:08,840
dozens of hours of anti drug education

1113
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:11,150
propaganda nonsense and so when I

1114
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,370
finally got dropped off at my house I

1115
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,480
made it inside and flopped down in the

1116
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,880
guest bedroom

1117
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,860
thinking that I was gonna die and that

1118
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,170
my mom was gonna be one of those sad ass

1119
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:25,070
moms that goes to middle schools like my

1120
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:27,019
son started smoking marijuana like ten

1121
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:30,289
years later after a horrible run of

1122
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:32,269
addiction so don't do drugs kids and

1123
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:35,150
then I woke up three hours later hungry

1124
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:44,239
[ __ ] but that's the first time I got

1125
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:47,539

1138
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,290

like it was made in ceramics class they

1187
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,369

1194
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:14,429
what was happening I was just like wow

1195
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:17,009
like I just knew something was weird and

1196
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:20,788
then uh they took me to a concert

1197
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:22,230
my uncle's Erik and Ron took me to a

1198
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:24,269
concert I don't even see it say the name

1199
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,190
of the band cuz it was some cheesy hair

1200
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:27,598
bands but it's cool I got to go with my

1201
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,309
uncles and it was in Long Beach in

1202
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,769
California so we were in an El Camino

1203
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:33,778
it's like a small truck and they were in

1204
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:35,538
the front I was in the back and they

1205
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:39,028
decided to smoke a joint on the way and

1206
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:40,859
play The Black Album from Metallica and

1207
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:42,480
that was a life-changing Drive that's

1208
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:44,940
what made me a drummer that's part of

1209
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,739
what made me a pothead I got so stoned

1210
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,239
from the joint they smoked all the smoke

1211
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:49,858
blew right in the back of the [ __ ]

1212
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,599
vehicle and I was just sitting there

1213
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:57,449
just chief and they knew it too they

1214
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:59,910
were laughing ha but I never hit the

1215
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:01,798
joint and they played that black album

1216
00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:03,149
from Metallica and by the time we got

1217
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:04,829
back I was already figuring out how I

1218
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,450
was gonna go by that album the next day

1219
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:10,440
I was like I'm a Metallica head and I

1220
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:12,838
want to get high and so uh this is life

1221
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,400
yeah yeah that's it that just changed

1222
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:15,838
some [ __ ] and then shortly after that my

1223
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,318
friend Chris root smoked me out and got

1224
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:21,058
me stupid I and we're in the parking lot

1225
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,469
of my elementary school I wasn't in

1226
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:25,410
elementary school anymore at this time I

1227
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:27,838
was an adult by now smoked a joint or a

1228
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:31,318
bowl with my buddy Chris Routh probably

1229
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,788
probably how old was I to say seventh

1230
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:34,710
grade exciti left California before

1231
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,370

1232
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,360
was I

1233
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:37,739
and it's about seventh grade when I

1234
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,809
first smoked weed with Chris Ruth I

1235
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,279
didn't smoke for a long time I didn't he

1236
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:44,190
would get me so high that I didn't like

1237
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,480
it it was too much like he was trying to

1238
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,800
he thought it was funny but he would get

1239
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,860
me so [ __ ] high that I didn't even

1240
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,910
enjoy it so I came out here and then I

1241
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,190
met up with some friends and they were

1242
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:54,929
smoking a bowl and I was like oh man I

1243
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,550
remember that I took a hit off of it I

1244
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:58,019
didn't get stupid hikes or smoking mids

1245
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,610
in Cali they're smoking good weed now

1246
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:00,989
here they're smoking shitty weed so I

1247
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,039

1248
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:06,259

00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:34,739
when Jesse's here because Jesse gets so

1303
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,900
high when he's hanging out with all of

1304
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:39,449
us cuz he just keeps taking dabs with us

1305
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:45,360
I think it's hilarious he always tries

1306
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:48,079
to say I didn't eat anything today he

1307

1315
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,200
some people get stage fright a little

1316
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,309
bit when we hit record some people go

1317
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,039
blank as soon as you hit the record

1318
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:13,019
button talkative people go silent and so

1319
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,460

1321
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,880
DAB so we had to piece together two

1322
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,650

1323

you anybody over there need a DAB I will

1422
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:04,769
never say unless it's like black unless

1423
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:10,469
it's black and that's not a besan that

1424
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:12,090
has nothing to do I get it sometimes a

1425
01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:14,309
little scary smoking some janky hash

1426
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,360
yeah what's the best way to handle that

1427
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:16,469
that's a good thing we can talk about

1428
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,650
here for the last couple of minutes on

1429
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:21,149
the show while we take a DAB and wrap up

1430
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:24,300
just say no what's a good way to handle

1431
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:26,820
that right now Betty all right bro you

1432
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:29,180
trippin I just I just had this happens

1433
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,180
all the time

1434
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:35,819
what's the way to do that what's the

1435
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,759
best way to handle that you guys what is

1436
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:49,440
the most what you say no you literally

1437
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:58,800
have to just educate them for it where

1438
01:00:49,440 --> 01:01:01,320
it's grown and processed I personally I

1439
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,359
think it's rude to see somebody smoking

1440
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,869
something bad for them and not inform

1441
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,639
them like they may get like you know

1442
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:10,710
even if they get defensive about it like

1443
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,000
don't try to be confrontational with it

1444
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:14,220
but at least you can feel good at the

1445
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,690
end of the day like hey I told that Duty

1446
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:18,358
smoking something that's gonna kill them

1447
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:21,300
yeah because like if I saw somebody drop

1448
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:23,099
some rat poison in some lasagna and then

1449
