my ig moniker instead of my real name

113
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040

118
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,119
when you sign up on patreon

119

i will give you a shout out under the

120
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
name you signed up under on patreon it's

121
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
the name i've got it's what i read on

122
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,039
the screen

123
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,399
it's easiest for me however i've

124
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,519
realized that some people don't want me

125
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
to say that name that they've got

126
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
another name they'd rather get a shout

127
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,039
out through

128
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,959
if you've got that name you want me to

129
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,400
say send it to me i'll do my best to

130
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
find that message i'll flag it i'll

131
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
print it out

132
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
i'll try to remember i'll try to

133
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
correlate that name that i see on the

134
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,119
screen to the name that you've sent me

135
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
honestly it takes a couple tries i've

136
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
got the add i got the brain thing

140
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,238

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,519
this question comes from

169
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,038
just because not everybody knows that

170
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,478
all the stuff that i do

171
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,719
so they're asking about some of the

172
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,399
strains that i breed from ire genetics

173
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
what cultivar would you recommend for

174
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,560
concentrates that is a very good

175
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,918
question

176
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,519
i really like talking about my

177
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,038
concentrates about my strains about my

178
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,959
cultivars about my breeding

179
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,800
so this will get me going i really like

180
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,478
this one i've got a lot of answers for

181
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
this question it kind of depends on

182
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,839
what kind of concentrates you want to

183
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,359
make do you want to make bubble hash do

184
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,879
you want to make bho

185
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
are you squishing stuff how are you

186
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,199
doing it that's going to kind of make a

187
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
difference here

188
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
what i've noticed is the strawberry

189
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,199
starburst

190
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
always makes super tasty delicious high

191
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
potency

192
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
concentrates no matter how you run it

193
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,080
how you press it squish it wash it

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
extract it blast it process it whatever

195
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,599
you want to call it

196
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
strawberry starburst will make amazing

197
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
concentrates

198
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
i am not a big fan of rosin i don't like

199
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,879
to smoke rosin most of the time

200
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
and i'm not a hater this is my honest

201
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,918
opinion i love a lot

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
of things rosin is not for me it tastes

203
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,198
like burnt popcorn

204
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,240
and popsicle sticks and that's not the

205
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,478
terp for me

206
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
so a lot of people love rosin a lot of

207
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,359
people love bho

208
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
a lot of people love different types of

209
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
stuff um

210
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,759
if you were making uh so i was where was

211
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
i i

212
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
remember what i was saying now i'm not a

213
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
big fan of rosin i got myself back on

214
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
track

215
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,160
uh my friend pedro made some rosin from

216
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
some strawberry starburst

217
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
and that rosin was some of the most

218
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
delicious and potent concentrate

219
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
i have ever inhaled and exhaled on the

220
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,439
inhale it tastes like sweet candy like

221
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,198
almost those uh

222
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,560
those watermelon candies or strawberry

223
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,240
candies that grandma used to have in a

224
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,079
candy dish on the table that got dusty

225
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
and [ __ ] but they still tasted good

226
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,079
i tasted like that on the inhale then on

227
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,639
the exhale it was like sweet bubble gum

228
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,399
and kush and it just stayed on my tongue

229
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
and i was high as [ __ ] my eyes got heavy

230
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,000
my lungs felt heavy from it

231
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
so that was a pedro dab of strawberry

232
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,279
starburst rosin

233
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
i bred the strawberry starburst our

234
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,119
buddy kelvin medina

235
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
actually grew the flowers and then pedro

236
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,759
from pedro's grow room

237
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,360
did the extraction and it was delicious

238
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
so the strawberry starburst is one of

239
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
the best for any kind of concentrates in

240
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,159
my opinion

241
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,560
then i also feel the same way about the

242
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,960
blue raspberry truffle

243
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,199
the blue raspberry truffle makes amazing

244
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,198
bho concentrates if you're making

245
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,478
anything using a solvent extract or a

246
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,400
solvent extraction

247
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,159
that blue raspberry truffle will dump

248
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,318
resin and it tastes so

249
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
crazy the concentrates and the terps are

250
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,000
just ridiculous it's like

251
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
ah blue raspberry candy blue raspberry

252
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
suckers

253
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
tropical skittles sour flavors uh

254
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,598
there's just tart flavors in there

255
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
there's cherry there's blueberry there's

256
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,279
all kinds of funky [ __ ] in there

257
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
uh it's got some just razzy stuff going

258
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,399
on it's really delicious so

259
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,439
then there's another one i talk about

260
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,198
all the time when it comes to

261
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,000
concentrates

262
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
one of my favorites for concentrates is

263
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,598
the cream

264
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,918
the cream makes really great bubble hash

265
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,159
the cream makes really good press hash

266
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,399
if you make bubble and then press it it

267
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
is tremendous it comes out white

268
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,918
and beach sandy there's something about

269
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,878
i'm not a concentrate maker i've said

270
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,799
this before

271
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
i enjoy concentrates i have i

272
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
experimented and attempted to make

273
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
concentrates i'm better at [ __ ] up a

274
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
concentrate

275
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
than i am at making them i'm much better

276
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,199
at smoking a concentrate than i am at

277
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
making them

278
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
so i let the concentrate makers do that

279
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,439
i focus on breeding podcasting growing

280
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,519
other things i feel like i've got my

281
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,680
niche but i don't know a lot

282
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,560
about the science of extracting but i

283
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
know there are different

284
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
size and shape trichomes on plants

285
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,279
and i thought that i know that the

286
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
strawberry starburst and blue raspberry

287
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,638
truffle

288
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,839
make tall trichomes with a big fat head

289
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
that is something i've seen

290
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,799
something i've seen under a microscope

291
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,680
something people have noticed and shown

292
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,359
to me

293
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,038
the opposite of that happens with the

294
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
cream those are short

295
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,319
and bulky almost like stocky fat boy

296
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,720
kind of

297
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
bowling pin shaped trichomes so they're

298
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
shorter and closer to the plant and

299
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,480
they're wider

300
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,879
and more bulbous on the top and they

301
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,639
have a fatter head for some reason that

302
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,278
seems to make a better bubble hash

303
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,039
product

304
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,720
i don't know again i'm not the

305
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,319
concentrate maker i don't know

306
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
your end of the job but i can tell the

307
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
two trichome size differences shape

308
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,278
differences

309
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
the two strains i mentioned at the first

310
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,838
have the longer skinny or taller

311
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,360
trichomes

312
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,800
and the short have shorter fatter

313
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
trichomes and they make completely

314
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,240
different kinds of concentrates

315
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
so you'll get like a oily texture out of

316
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
some and a sandy texture out of others

317
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
i think that the cream makes like a

318
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
beach sand like a

319
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,639
kind of a gritty baby powder sort of a

320
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,639
texture when it comes to making

321
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,480
concentrates and it's so beautiful

322
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,000
ah so my top three that i would

323
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,159
recommend would be the blue raspberry

324
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,559
truffle the strawberry starburst and

325
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,439
the cream with that being said the

326
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,719
blueberry

327
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
butcher that i just put out i said

328
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
blueberry putcher the blueberry butcher

329
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,639
that i just put out

330
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
also dumps and makes all kinds of

331
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,519
amazing concentrates

332
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,480
i breed for that high thc stuff because

333
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
i like to get

334
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
so high that i almost can't function

335
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480

00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,000
remain anonymous but bro you know who

367
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
concentrate production in mind

368
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120

guys know i believe in rastafari so

435
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,879
john gave me this knowledge and if i

436
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320

437
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,639
to myself to ja

438
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
and to you like i was given a gift i've

439
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,159
got this gift of gab i've got this gift

440
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
of learning of teaching

441

enjoy cannabis with a passion

443
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,679
if i didn't put this back out something

444
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,479
would go wrong i would spontaneously

445
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,919
combust

446
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519

447
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,399
your gifts and strike me down in some

448
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,759

it back out there and it feels good it's

454

particularly the minority community

492
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320

493
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,879

502
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,559
accents i love [ __ ] vibes from

503
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,079
everywhere ah man if we didn't have

504
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,759
people from other places

505
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,599
this country would be boring as [ __ ] if

506
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,559
it was just all one color people or one

507
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
type of people

508
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,679
this show would suck so i appreciate

509
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,519

510
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,519

out and get to them uh

512
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,278
uh who've been oppressed heavily from

513
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
[ __ ] cannabis laws i agree with that

514

following for a long time

527
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,958
shout out to my buddy ross to green

528
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
thumb check them out on the youtube

529
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,119
channel

530
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
it does follow up with i've got an

531
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
actual question

532
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,000
it says when it comes to breeding if you

533
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
were to breed with the strains you've

534
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,679
already made which ones do you think

535
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,879
would make something amazing

536
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,519
if combined such as raphael and orange

537
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,600
gasm

538
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,120
making a strawberry orange kind of terp

539
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
and then it says i plan to breed seeds

540
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,240
in the future and i want to use your

541
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
high standards of testing them

542
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
as well as picking good parents also

543
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
would you be opposed to me

544
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
making s-ones of some of your strains

545
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,360
and giving them to people

546
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
in my personal discord that need help

547
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,278
getting seeds

548
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
i want to touch on the making s ones of

549
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,159
my stuff before we talk about

550
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,759
your breeding and then i'll remember to

551
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,039
dust this microphone off

552
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,919
before i record another show things

553
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,240
dirty and embarrassing i'm sorry um

554
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,319
it is cool with me if you make s ones to

555
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,519
give to your friends in need

556
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
that i can't like afford seeds acquire

557
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,839
seeds and get seeds

558
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,278
when you become uh when it becomes a bad

559
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
idea is when you're stepping on my toes

560
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,278
stealing customers

561
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
uh just kind of [ __ ] with me so if

562
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,480
you're gonna make these seeds

563
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
and give them to people who are in need

564
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,759
that is respectable

565
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,198
uh you've got my permission and my

566
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
respect for that

567
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,758
don't cross the line and sell those

568
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
seeds and make s-ones of something that

569
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
i am putting out and then try to

570
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,000
piggyback off of that [ __ ] and make a

571
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,759
dollar off

572
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,039
of it that's a dick move it sounds like

573
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
what you're trying to do is totally cool

574
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,360
you're trying to help people i want you

575
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
to help people

576
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
if my strains become s ones and help

577
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
people that is improving

578
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
people's quality of life making people's

579
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
lives better uh

580
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
letting you help people you do that but

581
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,518
don't be a dick move and put them on the

582
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
market and sell them as

583
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,278
uh lemon jeffrey s ones or something

584
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,559
that's just being a dick move and

585
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,958
uh it's not gonna work for you anyway

586
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,000
but still in the community and the seed

587
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,758
breeding realm

588
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,958
that's that's where the borderline is if

589
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,800
you're gonna give them away i'm cool

590
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,638
with that give them away

591
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,479
but don't go making money off of my

592
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,600
creations which i know that sounds weird

593
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,278
because you're like bro you just make

594
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
seeds off of other people's strains yes

595
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,240
i do some work with it but

596
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
i've done my own research i've developed

597
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
my strains i've found parents i made

598
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
them you're just making photocopies

599
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,558
there's already somebody out there doing

600
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,679
that don't be that guy all right i know

601
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,199
you're not gonna do that i just had to

602
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,439
make that disclaimer i love you bro

603
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,038
no worries on that um so if you're gonna

604
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
make s-ones and give them away to people

605
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
in need that is cool don't make s-ones

606
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
and then profit off of my work that

607
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
you're just piggybacking on

608
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,439
that's a [ __ ] move i know you're not

609
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
going to do that because you say

610
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,880
take care brother may job provide you

611
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,719
with many more blessings and bless up

612
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
that shows me your respectful roster man

613
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
you're not going to do that to me now

614
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
let's talk about

615
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
the main part of your question here when

616
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,599
it comes to breeding if i were to breed

617
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
with strains i've already made

618
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,119
which strains do you think would make

619
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,879
some amaze something amazing

620
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,359
and then you ask about raphael and

621
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
orangegasm making orange strawberry kind

622
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,439
of terps

623
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
that sounds great but honestly it sounds

624
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,720
like it's so many sweet and tropical

625
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
things they're gonna cancel each other

626
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,919
out and it's gonna be weird and there's

627
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,839
already a lot of stuff already like that

628
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
honestly that's already been done uh

629
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,599
that's tangy

630
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,959
that's all the tangy crosses uh that's

631
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,038
tangibanji that's

632
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,240
uh strawberry banana tangy that's

633
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,960
already been done

634
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,319
um the tangy so let's talk about that we

635
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,079
could go back in time here

636
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,439
so you've got to be careful not to

637
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,240
bottleneck yourself when you were

638
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
breeding and if

639
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,400
i know the family history the family

640
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,359
trees of these tray of these two strains

641
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
raphael is a blueberry cookies two

642
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,359
strawberry fields

643
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,240
strawberry fields comes from crockett um

644
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,639
orange gasm

645
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,960
is golden goat to platinum tangy

646
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,840
platinum tangy is platinum cookies

647
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
to tangy tangy is back over here in

648
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,480
crockett's camp

649
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
i would have to carefully research the

650
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
strawberry fields

651
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,839
and the tangy and see if they have

652
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,880
similar parents because if so

653
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,959
they've already been it's already been

654
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
done that cross is kind of do you see

655
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
what i'm saying like they already

656
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
if crockett owns both those parents he's

657
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
probably already done that cross there's

658
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,240
no need for me to do it

659
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,319
also if i'm gonna breed so if i use that

660
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,279
strawberry there's the strawberry uh

661
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,599
fields in there

662
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,798
and the tangi in there they probably

663
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,240
already have a parent in there i don't

664
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,279
want to breed with something that's got

665
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
a similar parent

666
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,399
that's not going to do me any good

667
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,759
that's going backwards

668
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
so just with a little bit of quick

669
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,599
thinking about my family tree

670
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
raphael to orange gasm would just

671
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,918
basically be remaking some crockett [ __ ]

672
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
and i need to stay further away from

673
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
that to be original

674
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,960
i don't want to rewrite stairway to

675
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,879
heaven [ __ ] zeppelin already did that

676
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
so i need to use the same chords and

677
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
play it differently or [ __ ] not play

678
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
those chords at all

679
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,798
like i just don't want to recreate

680
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,480
something that crockett did or something

681
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,480
so close to crockett's camp and i know

682
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
you probably didn't even realize

683
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,279
that there was strawberry fields in

684
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,960
there that's from crockett and there's

685
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,160
tangy in there that's from crockett

686
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
and now we're just playing with two of

687
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
crockett's things all over again and

688
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,360
as a respectable breeder that's crockett

689
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,720
stuff he should if anyone's gonna cross

690
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,918
those two it should be crockett i don't

691
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
need to go backwards

692
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
so that is why uh i wouldn't cross those

693
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,280
and you gotta be careful about

694
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,879
bottlenecking yourself if there's a

695
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,079
similar parent which i'm sure there is i

696
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
didn't research that

697
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,199
but i'm sure there's a similar parent

698
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,359
between the tangie and the strawberry

699
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
fields probably a tangy something

700
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,038
probably that orange calio is probably

701
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,558
in there somewhere on both of them

702
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,158
uh so i would want to do that because

703
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,440
then i'm just breeding back to that same

704
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,280
parent that calio

705
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
that is common in those two is going to

706
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,519
come out again

707
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
it's just not something that would

708
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,519
interest me so um

709
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,440
then that's something as a breeder i

710
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,200
have to be careful about everything is

711
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
pollinated by king solomon

712
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
so if i want to breed strawberry

713
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
starburst to anything it can't be blue

714
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,760
it could be but it's not a good idea i'm

715
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,519
going backwards again i'm kind of

716
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,158
inbreeding cousin [ __ ]

717
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,279
uh that's never a good idea so i would

718
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
do strawberry star

719
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,918
strawberry strawberry starburst i'm

720
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
trying to keep my brain straight here

721
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
strawberry starburst 2 blue raspberry

722
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,759
truffle

723
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,079
would have two arise parents in there

724
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,400
we're going to get a lot of arise traits

725
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,678
strawberry starburst to sunkist we got

726
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
arize traits in there

727
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,720
so i've got to be careful not to breed

728
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,678
that back to anything that's been done

729
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,759
to arise

730
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,880
so then i would look to my blueberry

731
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,200
cookies line

732
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,799
or my grateful dog line and breed it to

733
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
something else that i have bread

734
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,359
all right here's a good example of some

735
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,038
strains i've crossed together that have

736
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,399
been strains i've created that i've

737
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,038
crossed together

738
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
the grateful dog is an inbred feminized

739
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,679
project i'm not going to talk too much

740
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,798
about the history of that you guys know

741
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,400
about that already

742
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,158
i've got the grateful dog that is my

743
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,919
plant femme seed female only

744
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,799
i've got the keeper the prize the winner

745
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,360
of that then i also made the arise which

746
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,720
is golden goat cross to daybreaker

747
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,319
then i took the golden goat and

748
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,679
daybreaker found a male out of that

749
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,000
that's king solomon

750
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
i pollinated that grateful dog and that

751
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
makes my morning do

752
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
so that is uh my child my child and my

753
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,320
grandchildren basically

754
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,678
crossing their making stuff so that's

755
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,720
when i'm able to cross stuff is when i

756
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,320
open it up and do

757
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
things that aren't all king solomon or

758
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,038
all the jack the ripper mail or all the

759
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,240
grateful dog mail

760
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,679
now you want to know uh uh what would be

761
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
something amazing something else you

762
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,000
think i would

763
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840
be something else you think i could make

764
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,519
that would be amazing the jack the

765
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,599
ripper crosses i just made

766
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,279
are amazing i do plan on finding some

767
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,199
males in that line

768
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,399
to go back to some of my females so

769
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
there will be some

770
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
jack the ripper crosses to our rise

771
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,759
crosses check the ripper crosses to

772
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,120
blueberry cookies crosses

773
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,279
some of those things will go back um

774
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,839
some of the feminized only stuff to more

775
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,119
feminized only stuff will be fun also

776
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,319
so when it comes to breeding if i were

777
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,158
to breed with the strains i've already

778
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,200
made which ones do i think would make

779
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,360
something amazing

780
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
ah grateful dog to arise that made

781
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
morning dew

782
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,159
um what else could we talk about lemons

783
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
uh lemon jeffrey

784
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,640
to the arise made lemon sunrise i made

785
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,679
both of those those are pretty awesome

786
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,679
there are a couple other things that

787
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,960
i've made that i haven't even released

788
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,480
that are pretty awesome that i'm not

789
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,679
even going to talk about the king's king

790
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,440
kim grape stomper oh g

791
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,798
crosses bred to some other stuff we're

792
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
pretty rad but

793
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,079
the reason i can't breed everything to

794
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,919
everything i want to go back to that is

795
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,678
because i will bottleneck myself all

796
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,520
work everything will all be

797
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
jack the ripper across to a rise crossed

798
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,240
to the same [ __ ] so

799
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,558
that's why you see me looking for new

800
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,319
males occasionally that's why every

801
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,079
year or two years i bust out a new

802
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,720
feminize project because i just need a

803
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,279
different

804
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,120
male plant to open up my breeding i'm

805
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,639
limited by plant counts i'm very very

806
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,639
limited by the amount of plants which i

807
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
can have here in the state of colorado

808
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
and in the position which i've put

809
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,120
myself in in the community on youtube

810
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
everywhere my face if you open if you

811
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,399
think about cannabis you probably

812
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
a lot of times my name is associated

813
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
with that so they whoever they are

814
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,759
babylon knows who i am so i've got to

815
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,439
follow the rules be really careful

816
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,240
i don't have an extra leaf if i'm

817
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,360
allowed 600 leaves i got 599 leaves you

818
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,319
know what i'm saying i'm following the

819
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,839
rules so

820
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,119
very limited by the amount of plants

821
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,480
which i can have now because all these

822
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,239
regulations and how

823
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,679
[ __ ] known i've made myself that's my

824
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,319
fault but that was my choice as well i

825
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,759
guess

826
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,759
uh but i'm well known so i got to be

827
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,119
careful i'm kind of like [ __ ] poster

828
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,558
boy now so i got to be

829
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,558
very careful on my plant count so i've

830
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,158
got the legal amount of plants so

831
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,918
i can't i don't want to get rid of

832
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
something because if i get rid of it

833
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,559
then i can't make more seeds of that i

834
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,000
can't breed it and the things i've got

835
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,639
i've fallen in love with

836
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,640
so to find another male i just reverse a

837
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,000
female it seems like a great way to open

838
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
up my opportunities

839
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,759
then all of my female plants also can

840
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,439
work as fema and male plants and

841
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,798
it just gives me that many more options

842
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
to play with

843
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,679
all right i know i kind of danced around

844
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,599
the question about what else would make

845
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,759
amazing stuff

846
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,199
anything with a different mail across to

847
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,640
anything with a different mail from my

848
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
line would be cool i think

849
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,919
i would all work very well because my

850
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,079
selections have been very

851
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
very good the true kush cross to have

852
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,879
the truth across to everything that's

853
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,480
true kush to arise

854
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
the truth would make some really super

855
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
stinky indica dominant stuff that i

856
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,798
wanted to do

857
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,719
uh that chemdaily chem cross is going to

858
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,000
be great but uh

859
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,759
yeah i'm kind of rambling about that

860
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,440
because i wanted to dance around that i

861
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,038
do approve if you want to make those s1

862
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
seeds and pass them out to your friends

863
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,480
i have no problem with that don't make

864
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,519
money off of them um

865
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
and then just think about what you're

866
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,319
doing when it comes to breeding make

867
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
sure you don't bottleneck yourself

868
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,359
make sure you don't inbreed too much

869
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,720
unless that's what you mean to do

870
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,879
that's when you start pulling out those

871
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,240
traits from the

872
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,159
plants that you have a lot of the mix

873
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,519
and it's like chefing if you put two

874
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,880
ingredients and two ingredients that are

875
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,319
the same on both sides when you mix

876
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
those two bowls together

877
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,439
those two ingredients are gonna dominate

878
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,879
the mix you're not gonna be able to wash

879
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
those out of the flavor at all

880
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,960
all right there are more questions for

881
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
this show i don't want to ramble on for

882
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,919
too long i got too stoned and rambled a

883
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,200
lot in this episode there are a couple

884
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,320
of edit points i need to make sure to

885
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,480
catch

886
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,319
um let's see where do we go this one

887
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,400
came from our friend cincy 11 shout out

888
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,200
to cincy 11 on patreon

889
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,120
uh it goes like this it says pollination

890
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
back to 18 6. my head grower

891
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,158
and i pushed out on flipping the cross

892
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,159
10 back to 18 6. we both said we

893
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,760
uh wouldn't this cause problems after i

894
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,640
brought it up if it doesn't cause

895
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,879
problems why

896
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
and how many days after pollination is

897
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,159
cool to do it all right so what they're

898
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,319
talking about

899
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,000
is when i pollinate plants when i'm

900
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,720
breeding when my plants are only

901
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,599
intended for

902
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
seed after pollination i wait a couple

903
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,000
of days maybe three five maybe seven

904
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
days depending

905
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,880
on how the plants react then i will turn

906
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
my lights back to an 18-6

907
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
cycle and you're going to say why would

908
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
you do that because i'm not growing buds

909
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,839
i'm growing seeds i don't care what the

910
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,839
buds look like i'm not worried about

911
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,879
trichomes buds flowers

912
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,798
i am 100 focused on making quality seed

913
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,760
for the consumer which is you

914
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,558
so i turn my light timer back to 18 6.

915
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,558
why

916
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,000
because light is the main source of

917
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,759
energy for our plant that's the main

918
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,599
nutrient that our plant wants

919
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,519
also the main nutrient the main source

920
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,000
of energy to make those seeds

921
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,558
get big fat beefy healthy and harden up

922
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,200
faster

923
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,960
quicker and earlier than ever before so

924
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,080
i'm giving them more light

925
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,679
they're using so they're getting uh six

926
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,319
hours more they're getting half a day

927
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,519
more light

928
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,839
every day than they would if they were

929
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,200
on flower so that cuts down my flowering

930
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,639
time by a couple of weeks because

931
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,519
they're getting the light they need for

932
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,759
growth

933
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,158
during the day hours that they're on my

934
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,038
flowers turn to [ __ ]

935
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
my flowers look like a [ __ ] mess my

936
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,158
flowers start to re-veg

937
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,159
they start throwing out shoots and

938
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,840
making weird shaped leaves they do all

939
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
kinds of crazy funky [ __ ] but you know

940
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,599
what

941
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,038
i don't care i'm not growing for buds

942
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
not growing for buds at all

943
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,038
i throw the buds away i cut the plants

944
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,558
down i let them dry to a crisp

945
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,000
i put on rubber gloves and i go like

946
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,879
this i'll do it over the mic so the

947
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,319
audio listeners can hear i go like this

948
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
with the buds between my hands and they

949
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,639
crumble up into dust and all the seeds

950
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,120
fall out

951
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
i run that whole pile of stuff the dust

952
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,879
the sticks and everything through a seed

953
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,960
sorter and it pulls the seeds out for me

954
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
the leftover [ __ ] that's not seeds is

955
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,919
all trash

956
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,360
it all goes in a compost bin i don't do

957
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,200
anything with that it's been so beat up

958
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,639
it's been so finger banged and destroyed

959
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
through the extraction process of

960
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
getting the seeds out

961
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,599
it is absolutely useless to me we've

962
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
made edibles out of it we've made

963
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,000
concentrates out of it it's not worth it

964
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,200
it's green it's funky it tastes terrible

965
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,319
it's just been abused

966
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,679
so all that is trash so it will [ __ ] up

967
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,119
your plants your plants will look like

968
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
[ __ ] they'll go back into veg

969
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,639
they'll start shooting out shoots

970
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,360
they're gonna make all kind of crazy

971
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,120
mutated leaves and weird shapes but i

972
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,759
don't care i'm not growing for buds at

973
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,759
this point

974
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,240
what i'm talking about is purely a

975
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,599
seeded crop i'm only looking for seeds

976
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,440
once you cut those down and pull the

977
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,038
seeds out show me what the buds look

978
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,480
like

979
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,919
show me tell me what the buds look like

980
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
when you have those seeds in your hand

981
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
no one's ever going to know that those

982
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,038
plants look like [ __ ] aliens they

983
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
look

984
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,558
sad they look like they're in [ __ ]

985
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
some hostage situation

986
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,158
but the seeds are amazing because they

987
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,679
got more light they were able to

988
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,840
photosynthesize faster

989
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,519
they came down maybe three weeks sooner

990
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,959
than the plants that i did not put on

991
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,079
the 18 6 cycle

992
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,519
so don't puss out don't be afraid

993
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,599
it does cause problems it makes the

994
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,278
plants go [ __ ] completely bonkers

995
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,000
but aren't you growing for seeds and not

996
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,440
buds gotta focus on the goal here uh

997
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
worry about the outcome

998
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,120
not the process getting to the outcome

999
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
think about what's going on

1000
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,158
i want to read the question in my head

1001
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,200
one more time make sure i covered all

1002
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,440
this stuff here

1003
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
uh head grower pussed out uh said it

1004
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,038
would cause problems yeah what kind of

1005
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
problems bro ah no problems dude it's

1006
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,679
just gonna make your seeds better and if

1007
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,398
you're growing for a flower don't do

1008
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,080
this

1009
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,319
if you're grown for flower wait until

1010
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,439
the last 10 to 14 days to flip it back

1011
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,200
then that is cool

1012
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
but if you're growing with seeds do it

1013
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,480
about three five maybe seven to ten days

1014
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,159
after pollination

1015
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,599
so shortly after pollination it is safe

1016
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,399
to turn those lights back to eighteen

1017
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,678
six uh once you're uh once you see the

1018
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:06,798
they're all curled up and they look like

1019
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
they're pollinated you can see the

1020
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,038
little seeds forming in there put it

1021
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,278
back on eighteen

1022
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,398
six uh there's no problem with that

1023
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:13,679
they're going to eat more

1024
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,119
they're going to grow more they're going

1025
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,038
to finish sooner the seeds will be

1026
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,038
bigger harder and fatter

1027
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,038
this last crop of jack the ripper seeds

1028
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,440
that i made was finished under 18

1029
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,278
6 under leds and they're the biggest

1030
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,600
fattest seeds i've ever bred with

1031
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,960
the highest germination rate i've ever

1032
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,719
accomplished so

1033
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
