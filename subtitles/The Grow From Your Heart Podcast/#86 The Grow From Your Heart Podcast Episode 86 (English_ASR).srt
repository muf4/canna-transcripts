would never assume that I had any kind

113
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:14,929
of but besides just stereotyping like

tattoos hey we can't be seen right now I

115

116
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,918
stereotyping like just from appearance

117
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,300
the way that I present myself you you

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,839
wouldn't really assume that I had any

119
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,870
past experience with organizations or

120
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,418
criminal activity at all but uh man the

121
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,819
main thing I want to talk about is just

122
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:37,549
really like how much has changed being

123
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,168
able to smoke bud freely and grow but in

124
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,050
the stress reliever that comes with it

125
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:43,819
uh I mean I started smoking weed back in

126
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,300
fifth grade I don't know the age that

127
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,769
you are in fifth grade eleven yeah Evan

128
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,759
or Twila I wouldn't want you were

129
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:57,889
probably 14 what happened I never failed

130
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,800
actually always had good um I went to a

131
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,870
minority school I am NOT a minority so I

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,550
was integrated into a minority school

133
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,110
and put in the paper and stuff and it

134
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,050
was fifth grade through twelfth grade in

135
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,060
one school and I used to walk home with

136
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,228
all the older kids I won't say any names

137
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,519
but shout out say who you are and you

138
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,930
know the neighborhood was right behind

139
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,209
the school so we would walk home and

140
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,519
they always smoked every day and then

141
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,930
one day they were just like do you want

142
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,159
to smoke too and I didn't even know it

143
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,090
was bad I've seen other people smoke

144
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,860
cigarettes I didn't really know the

145
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,109
difference between what people are

146
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,509
smoking and I remember that day we

147
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,490
smoked a blunt we went and sat in their

148
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,560
shed and played Sega Genesis for like

149
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,600
two hours until my mom got off work and

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,879
they never brought up anything being

151
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,580
wrong until right when my mom was gonna

152
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,110
get there and they looked at me and said

153
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:47,779
tell her you have a headache and go to

154
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,788
your room don't eat anything and then

155
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,978
that was the daily routine after that

156
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:55,310
forever but I've always had to hide

157
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:59,079
smoking weed and and all of that own I

158
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,759
have a paraphernalia charge for a roach

159
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,969

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,939

165
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,120
like I was the only white person there

166
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,710
and they can't there was like two bongs

167
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,788
in the house and the police came up to

168
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:25,069
me and they're like oh these must be

169
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:26,000
yours because you're white and I'm a

170
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,319
smartass

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,598
so I looked at them I was like actually

172
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,279
I smoke blunts instead of just being

173
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,560
like I don't smoke cuz you know I'm an

174
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,569
[ __ ] uh so they walked over to the

175
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,920
ashtray grabbed a roach dropped in front

176
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,439
of me and said paraphernalia

177
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,790
and it is still to this day on my record

178
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,540
was that a felony or a misdemeanor

179
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,160
misdemeanor okay I hate that there's

180
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,230
only two levels of charges like

181
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
misdemeanor felony because felonies are

182
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,040
in there with like rapists and murderers

183
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,299
that's that's messed up like in North

184
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,860
Carolina you can get a felony

185
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,020
I think they changed it now but when I

186
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,210
was growing up anything over 1/2 ounce

187
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:04,219
of marijuana was a felony so he'd be put

188
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:08,209
in with a rapist yeah but now I'm in

189
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,620
there yeah right I don't need that but

190
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,509
now I think you can have an ounce and a

191
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,829
half which still isn't [ __ ] like you

192
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,659
could have a pound of happy not gonna

193
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:19,370
hurt anybody uh it's all about what

194
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:22,460
you're doing um but marijuana really

195
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,399
gave me an out from where I was before I

196
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:30,289
was in Colorado I was in a camper that

197
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:32,599
was like 10 by 10 with no insulation it

198
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,819
had nails coming through the roof and I

199
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,890
literally ran an extension cord from the

200
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,870
camper to somebody's well because you

201
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,599

202
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,459
like lights and stuff and I had my Mac

203
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,040
computer in there and I just made music

204

205
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,629
stuff but I had a good life it was it

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,189

all it's been it's been amazing here

233
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,599
just there's so many people with the

234
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,720
same mind stay and

235
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,470
positive energies and just trying to

236
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,759
help each other and progress in life I

237
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,500
feel like that's big people don't like

238
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,818
progressing I'm right some people are

239
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,879
stuck and want to be okay with where

240
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:06,139
they are yeah in content that's why I

241
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,278
got this group of people here at this

242
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,568
table because we're all people that are

243
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,698
all about moving each other and

244
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:12,708
ourselves forward a little bit can't

245
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:13,818
ever be comfortable no no as soon as

246
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,039
you're comfortable that's when you start

247
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:17,958
[ __ ] up stagnation yeah if you want

248
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,208
to be ahead you got to keep moving right

249
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,518
yeah if you're if life is super duper

250
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:25,338
easy and you do the same thing every day

251
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:29,209
and not much changes and you're unhappy

252
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,190
about it the only one thing to do that's

253
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,379
right yep make the progression take the

254
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,519
next steps like if you're already stuck

255
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,689
and frustrated what are you gonna do

256
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,698
make yourself more stuck and frustrated

257
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,949
like you gotta think it through but I

258
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:42,198

learning how to grow yes

278
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:25,060
it was um like I can remember so vividly

279
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:27,429
the first time that garden of Weeden oh

280
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:31,458
I could remember the first time I took

281
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:37,609
official dab I got off oh I got off the

282
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:38,989
plane and when when she pulled the ring

283
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,220
in the torch out man he pulled the ring

284
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,220

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,559
literally just laid my face on the

288
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,669
window and just stared so you're saying

289
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,708
I'd have been in the car when you got

290

your first dab yes you were off the

291
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:06,250
plane boom

292
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,980
within the car three seconds of being in

293
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,539

can I can I can totally remember the

299
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,310
first time that they were like the light

300
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:39,969
to cut on and they were like brought me

301
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:42,699
into the garden it was I would like to

302
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,500
say it was all white widow and to blue

303
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,240
dream plants in there and all you could

304
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,570
smell was the blue dream it was Venice

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,330
correct amazing yes and I just days I

306
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,910
remember the feeling like in my body of

307
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,650
like overwhelming sensations that like I

308
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:58,029
honestly thought that I would never

309
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,149
experience something like that without

310
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,159
going to another country because it's

311
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,409
crazy it's just plants but back in North

312
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,939
Carolina if you have that many plant you

313
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:10,600
are they think you're a [ __ ]

314
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,120
terrorist they like come swat4 andi

315
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,100
hazen and shooting like this plan is

316
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,080
gonna spread like Jumanji and kill the

317
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,430
town like you're so ridiculous but the

318
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,950
worst thing about a red man is the first

319
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,139
thing they do is shoot your dog oh [ __ ]

320
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,750
I know this sounds crazy but if they

321
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:29,370
shoot my dog in front of me it's going

322
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,370
down like I'm going to strike

323
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,340
hypothetically you just might yeah yeah

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
for real because that's a loved family

325
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,030

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,840
conceited people in this world that just

bad like put your card up you just

527
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,409

534
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:20,329

543
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:45,119
cool to see like real perspectives of

544
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,579
other places and the way that they

545
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,389
interact and just all kinds of stuff I

546

really enjoy periscope it's it's it's

547
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,890
enough it's the best social networking

548
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,739

550
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:05,480
ah I would say watching just because I

551
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,640
like other countries I like seeing

552
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,210

556
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,409

they'll be cool they'll be talking in a

558
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:21,350
Russian accent Russian and they'll see

559
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,538
something that you're American like

560
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,069
automatic ah [ __ ] do we kill you and

561
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:26,569

564
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,389
to be a dick about it but the United

565
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:54,798
Arab Emirates does not like white people

566
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:56,000
when we go on periscope so yeah we're I

567
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,679
think everyone in the room is slightly

568
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,509
addicted to periscope there might be a

569
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,509
slight addiction here it's pretty great

570
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,490
I try to do at least once a day I jump

571
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,808
on and do a quick like sometimes you

572
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,429
never know with me it could turn into an

573
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:11,658
hour and a half right if you got people

574
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,750
watching and they're talking to me it

575
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:16,250
could be a friend yeah and I get podcast

576
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,538
information like people ask me questions

577
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,890
and I'm like oh yeah I'm gonna write

578
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:20,450
that down listen to the podcast I'll

579
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,220
tell you that on the next show yeah and

580
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,600
so I get stuff like that and then I've

581
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,700
actually done a live show with

582
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,199
everything on periscope so hopefully

583
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,909
I'll do that in the future I only did it

584
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,610

808

throw a few bucks at the Pay Pal account

809

810
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,930
five dollars if you got 10 dollars that

811
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,789
would work if you want to add some zeros

812
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,769
onto the end of that I am NOT going to

813
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,180
complain it would be much appreciated I

814
