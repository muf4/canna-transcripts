00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,439
mother welcome back podcast world I'm

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,439
your host rosta Jeff this is episode

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,880
873 of the grow from your heart podcast

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,159
you know I've got another fun episode

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,559
lined up for us in today's podcast I'm

9
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,159
going to give away free seeds hang out

10
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,640
we'll talk more about those free seeds

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,679
later on in today's show before we jump

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
into the question and answer portion of

13
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,198
today's podcast I want to talk about

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,679
something that I noticed while I was

15
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:52,320
watering my own garden I recently turned

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,600
on the water and I got a very strong

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,558
bleach sort of a smell coming from my

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,198
local tap water uh what I realize is it

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,479
is now the springtime and they have

20
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,320
changed theic Municipal Water to the

21
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,319
spring treatment most of the municipal

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,118
water plants will change how they treat

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,279
the water based on the season they

24
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,239
recently upgraded or updated to the

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,759
Spring Seasonal treatment in my water

26
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,079
treatment area so my water does smell

27
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,478
different which means my pH is different

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,239
my EC is different the ppms of my water

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,759
are different so if you're one of those

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
people that water your plants uh if you

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,040
mix your nutrients based on memory if

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,680
you're like if I use this many mills of

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,920
this and this much of this product and

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,720
mix this much [ __ ] together then I need

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,159
seven drops of pH Down uh right now you

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,158
may need to adjust your schedule adjust

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,280
your mix uh give that a little bit of a

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
check just give yourself a heads up uh

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,200
set yourself up for success and check

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,640
the pH of your Final Mix uh maybe even

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,880
check the pH of the water coming out

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,280
just for shits and giggles for

43
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,959
scientific reasons then check the pH of

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,560
your mix and see if you do need to

45
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,438
adjust your mix and your habits and or

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,359
your strategies in any way shape or form

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,559
because I did notice a strong Aroma of

48
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,359
bleach I noticed my pH was a little bit

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,439
different so I did have to make

50
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,000
adjustments to my regular habits my

51
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,959
regular uh mixing pattern did need to

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,039
get adjusted so I recommend you check on

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,479
yours so we don't make any mistakes if

54
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,919
your plants are looking weird if they

55
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,639
look like [ __ ] uh possibly you have fed

56
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,318
them something that was a little too

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,119
rich maybe a little bit too hot we might

58
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,919
want to check on the pH of that final

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,519
solution all right that is my public

60
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,479
service announcement here to start this

61
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,879
episode I did say that I'm going to give

62
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,039
away free seeds how do we do that I have

63
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,799
a website that website is iry

64
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,079
genetics.com on the top of that website

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,879
there's a row of tabs one of those tabs

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
does say grow help or grow questions if

67
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,439
you click on that tab you are given the

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,680
opportunity to send me a good grow

69
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,280
question if you send me a good grow

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,599
question and I read your question here

71
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,318
on the podcast I will send you a coupon

72
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,560
code for a free pack of seeds on my

73
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,878
vending website idirect decom today's

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,239
first question from that growel tab did

75
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,280
come from somebody who wants to be

76
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,200
called Rhino big shout out to my new

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,680
friend rhino hey Rhino make sure you

78
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,359
check your inbox because you've got a

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,799
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,519
iirc the question from my new friend

81
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,799
Rhino goes a lot like this it says does

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,158
transplanting up going from 1 gallon to

83
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,280
3 gallon to 5 gallon fabric pots why not

84
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,598
just leave it in the pot instead of

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,158
taking it out the roots grow through the

86
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,318
pot and it doesn't seem to slow the

87
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,560
growth I know cutting Roots makes more

88
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,000
Roots what is better thank you rosta

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,799
Jeff so what this person is asking about

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,840
I always recommend going uh in graduated

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,080
pot sizes if that's possible for your

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,280
grow space what I mean by that is we

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,080
start off with our clone or our seedling

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,438
don't put that in a seven gallon pot put

95
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
that in a beer cup or a 4in net pot or a

96
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,919
6in pot put that in a smaller pot be

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
more economical with your space your

98
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,238
soil your water it's more cost effective

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,280
and then I recommend once that plant

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
gets root bound or close to rootbound in

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,759
that container graduate to the next size

102
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,279
I go from the small pot to the one

103
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,798
gallon then into a three maybe a five I

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,878
don't do much up potting after that but

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
I would go incrementally instead of just

106
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,598
going from the small to the giant pot

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,158
there are several reasons for that it

108
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,840
controls the root growth a little bit I

109
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,359
like a nice kind of I like it when it

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,799
just starts to get tight in that

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,560
container when you put it into the next

112
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,439
container it really explodes also you

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,639
don't have to take up as much space if

114
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,959
you're only running a tiny tiny plant a

115
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,478
seven gallon pot takes up a lot of space

116
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,198
and space is one of the most valuable

117
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,120
things for a any kind of cultivator or

118
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,400
farmer so you don't need as much space

119
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,120
you don't need as much water because you

120
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,918
don't have to water that big volume of a

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,959
pot you don't need as much nutrients CU

122
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,918
you're not using as much water and it's

123
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,879
easier to maintain the water and not

124
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,319
overwater that plant when it is in a

125
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,279
smaller pot so I recommend graduating up

126
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,279
to pot size this listener or viewer

127
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,239
asked why not if we're using a fabric

128
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,399
pot why not just leave that plant in the

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,519
fabric pot and drop it in the soil into

130
00:04:53,399 --> 00:05:00,519
the next size up um my answer is most of

131
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,279
the time when you use the word just you

132
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,959
know you're doing it wrong if you say

133
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,599
why don't you just that is the lazy way

134
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,758
out that is the you know there's a

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,000
better way you're doing it just fine

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,919
just good enough why don't you do it the

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
right way instead of doing it just good

138
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,359
enough to get by that is my theory here

139
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,560
and I'm not trying to discredit you or

140
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,639
discount you or anything you're asking

141
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,280
me why I don't do it because uh it's

142
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,720
going to be much healthier and much more

143
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,318
effective for those plants and uh it's

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,800
just I don't it seems sort of lazy to

145
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,360
just drop that plant in there I would

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,319
take it out of that fabric pot set that

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,360
pot side rinse it scrub it out use it

148
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,639
again in the future and then just place

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,720
that soil into the that whole plant into

150
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,680
your neck size up I don't see uh I don't

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,520
see any benefit in using that original

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,519
pot yes the roots will grow through it

153
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,639
but they're going to have to fight to

154
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,519
grow through it don't you want them to

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,600
grow and expand and fill that next uh

156
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,918
container and be robust or do you want

157
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,879
them to have to fight that's like

158
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,560
packing your soil way too tight it's

159
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,719
like putting up a gate it's like saying

160
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,478
yeah there's more soil over there good

161
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,919
luck [ __ ] try to get to that I would

162
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,519
rather just take that off and let those

163
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,079
roots expand freely uh when I take that

164
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,719
first pot off I actually stick my

165
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,079
fingers in there and crunch those roots

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
up and break them up a little bit to

167
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,918
encourage that outward growth so I take

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,080
off that pot um the start of this is

169
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,399
when you when you say just that's always

170
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,879
you know you're doing why don't you just

171
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,120
do it this way you could just you could

172
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,560
just do it the lazy way or you could do

173
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,000
it the right way you could just stick

174
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,319
with the right way and do what you know

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,839
is right um set yourself up for Success

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,759
um let those roots grow take off that

177
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,758
pot let them grow um Al I feel like I

178
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,720
assume I imagine you're going to get

179
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,840
especially if you do multiple layers of

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,520
this you're going to get watering issues

181
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,198
that fabric pot's going to hold water

182
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,318
it's going to start to get algae or mold

183
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,079
building up in that pot I just don't

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
like the idea of having that fabric pot

185
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,680
buried under my soil that doesn't it

186
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,240
doesn't sit right with me when I could

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,360
have just taken it off and done it the

188
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,879
right way so um yeah encourage the root

189
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,680
growth by taking that off of there

190
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,360
recycle the pot by taking that off of

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,918
there let them grow freely by taking it

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,560
off and avoid watering issues just

193
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,359
taking it out of that pot let me read to

194
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,038
make sure I got this right um yeah we

195
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,280
got this one right my dude Rhino thank

196
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,199
you for the good uh mind inspiring

197
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,719
question make sure you check your inbox

198

decom let's keep this party moving I do

201
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,079
have another great question here in

202
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,800
front of me this one came from our

203
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,159
friend who wants to be called sticky

204
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,560
what's up sticky it's really uh I I know

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
a lot of people who call themselves

206
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,759
sticky in the Cannabis industry shout

207
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,279
out to my new friend sticky sticky check

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,038
your inbox because you've got a coupon

code for a free pack of seeds from

210
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:39,159
idirect decom this question says Hey

211
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,038
roster Jeff I love the content and the

212
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,280
genetics thank you bro I do appreciate

213
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,839
that uh I love making great genetics for

214
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,758
the community that you guys can grow

215
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,638
successfully and then uh feels like it's

216
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,680
my duty to come help you grow them once

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,120
I put those out uh so thank you for

218
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,598
noticing it says I'm having issues with

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,038
my reservoir staying at the right pH

220
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,519
level uh so this person has a reservoir

221
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:01,759
that they fill with uh water and then

222
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,918
probably it sounds like they're putting

223
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,400
their nutrient solution in there and

224
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,959
they're keeping that nutrient solution

225
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,279
for a period of time it does not

226
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,120
indicate that here uh it says it keeps

227
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,478
flu fluctuating every time I go to feed

228
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,439
I check and my pH has gone up why am I

229
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,240
having to pH my water every two days I'm

230
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,959
using okay they exch explain what

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,720
they're using I stopped adding silica

232
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,839
that's not going to help um can you

233
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,840
possibly explain yes I've got a couple

234
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,679
of great uh Solutions uh about your

235
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,038
solution here so this person has a

236
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,560
reservoir I've talked about this they've

237
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,278
got a reservoir they're putting their

238
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,639
nutrients in there so that they can feed

239
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,278
probably um some sort of a hydroponic

240
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,278
system throughout the week and they're

241
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,559
checking that pH every two days uh maybe

242
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,958
they're scooping water up I don't know

243
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,679
they got water and nutrients in a tank

244
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,319
premixed ready to rock and they're

245
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,759
saying every two days when they check

246
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,640
the pH is [ __ ] up there are a couple

247
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,360
of reasons for this um the first reason

248
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,799
is General

249
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,800
evaporation uh the water is evaporating

250
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,639
I don't know and this is where I have a

251
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,838
question that this one you can just fill

252
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,759
in the gaps on your own if you're using

253
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,720
any kind of hydroponic system if this

254
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,439
Reservoir is being pumped to anything uh

255
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,839
and then being returned or just drained

256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,079
to waste um so there's water being

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,160
pumped out if it is a returned system

258
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,599
some of that water is evaporating some

259
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,399
of that water is being eaten by the

260
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,120
plants or being absorbed and taken up by

261
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
the plants so the water is evaporating

262
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
and being absorbed by the plants now

263
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,958
what's happening in is inside your

264
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,479
Reservoir that salt is not evaporating

265
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,799
the some of the salts are being eaten by

266
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,159
the plant but you've got some of the

267
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,919
water being eaten and evaporation so

268
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,679
that evaporation your water level is

269
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,838
going down but the salt level is staying

270
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,679
there because the salts do not evaporate

271
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,320
your total dissolve solids will go up

272
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,759
because there's less water the same

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,079
amount of salt your ratio is just

274
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,439
changing based on that little bit of

275
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,919
evaporation that is my assumption um my

276
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,360
other assumption is whatever you're

277
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:01,479
using for your pH or pH Down is not

278
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,200
stable are you using the bottled ph up

279
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,600
and PH down products they sell at the

280
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
store or are you using something

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,800
different or are you phing at all you

282
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
sounds like you are but my main

283
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,679
assumption main thing is going to be

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
evaporation that water is evaporating

285
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,639
over two two days you might be losing

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
just very little you might be losing

287
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,720
quite a bit of water I don't know your

288
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
situation but that water is evaporating

289
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,360
the water level is changing and the

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
salts are not uh evaporating they're

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
staying right there so that is what is

292
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
changing also give it a good stir uh I

293
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,159
would recommend putting some sort of a

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,959
stir pump in that tank at all times uh

295
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,399
don't air rate it don't put oxygen in

296
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,239
there that's not what I would do I would

297
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,039
Stir It just drop like um a fish tank

298
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
pump that's designed to a fountain pump

299
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,159
is what I'm talking about a pump that's

300
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
just going to move the water uh to

301
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,519
suction cup it to the side blowing off

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,759
to one side that way it's just pulling

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,159
the water from one side to the other um

304
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,000
if you got a reservoir that's a trash

305
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,600
can or it'll just stir around that way

306
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,799
for you keep that water moving keep

307
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,959
those nutrients moving that will help

308
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,199
but I think a lot of it is evaporation

309
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,719
also um depending on what nutrients

310
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,079
you're mixing together some of these

311
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,680
things may be binding Andor falling out

312
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,679
of solution stirring will help with that

313
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
but the binding can't be prevented with

314
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,159
some things that's why these products

315
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,679
are sold in separate bottles um some

316
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,480
things should not be mixed together

317
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,278
because they will chemically bond

318
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,759
together they will sink to the bottom

319
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,879
that will affect your pH that will

320
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,720
affect everything those nutrients are

321
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,879
slowly changing into other compounds

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,079
over time in that uh solution honestly I

323
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,559
don't have the organic chemistry uh

324
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,000
knowledge to tell you exactly what's

325
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,919
happening there but I think I said it

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,799
close enough uh you guys correct me

327
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,639
educate me I'm not afraid to be educated

328
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,759
updated corrected uh that's what the

329
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,399
comment section is for let me know am I

330
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,078
missing something but um it could be

331
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,039
evaporation uh it could be because the

332
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,759
plants are simply eating it it could be

333
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,120
because chemical bonding is happening

334
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,240
inside of this

335
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,959
Reservoir um what did I write down the

336
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,079
water is being used in evaporating the

337
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,679
salts don't evaporate the EC and the pH

338
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,399
will change based on the the evaporation

339
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,599
also it could be bonding so that's my

340
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,240
story I'm sticking to it my dude's

341

question says first let me say roster

363
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,958
Jeff you do a wonderful show thank you

364
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm having fun on this episode it says

365
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,679
very informative keep up the great work

366
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,639
thank you bro I will I'm on a roll says

367
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,638
now to my questions what is a natural

368
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,720
fade when does it actually occur and if

369
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,600
I don't do a flush before chop will the

370
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,560
plants naturally fade or does the flush

371
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,879
Aid in uh The Fading process I'm just

372
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:20,039
looking to understand this amazing plant

373
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,480
a little better this is a very good

374
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,078
question um let's talk about what this

375
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,079
person means by a fade um when you're

376
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,759
growing your ganja plants you may notice

377
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:30,879
that in the final weeks right before you

378
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:33,559
cut that that plant down your leaves

379
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,159
will begin to change colors um there's a

380
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,679
few reasons for this which I will

381
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,958
discuss or try to cover but those leaves

382
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,399
change colors that is the fade when it

383
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,518
goes from whatever color it started as

384
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,120
was it bright green was it lime green

385
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,560
was it dark green were they maybe sort

386
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,159
of black did they fade off and go yellow

387
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,919
did they turn a little bit of orange did

388
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,958
you get some maroonish colors in there

389
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,439
did you get bright bright yellows do

390
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,799
those black p black Lea plants do they

391
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,959
start to turn a little bit red on you

392
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,319
that is a fade that is the natural fade

393
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,399
that is what this listener Andor viewer

394
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,079
is asking about what is the natural fade

395
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,720
when does it actually occur um it occurs

396
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,679
at the end and it could be uh it is part

397
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,560
of syence it's part of the plant ending

398
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,159
it's part of maybe the plant ripening

399
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,039
which I we're going to talk about that

400
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,480
in a little bit here it could be from a

401
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,879
lot of different things and I wrote down

402
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,800
a big list of things that could cause

403
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,000
the fade sometimes it will happen

404
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,639
sometimes it will not happen sometimes

405
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,919
it's genetic some times it's environment

406
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,720
um I've got a big list of what we'll

407
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,278
talk about but um I'm going to jump

408
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,759
right into my notes it says I don't

409
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,439
think that fade is too important fade

410
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,120
doesn't matter to me fade is it's

411
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,800
beautiful it's it's colorful if I want

412
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,000
to take really good photographs if I

413
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,278
want to get likes on Instagram uh if I

414
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
want a room that looks good for the

415
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,480
internet fate is beautiful but uh as a

416
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480
consumer as a smoker as a grower as

417
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
somebody who has to I touch the plant

418
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,560
all the way through uh I [ __ ] pop the

419
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,160
seed I plant them I grow them I trim

420
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,838
them I smoke them fade doesn't really do

421
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,919
a lot other than like I said for the

422
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,240
camera fade is best for visual uh that's

423
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,000
all it really does uh it will indicate

424
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,120
things it can show you stuff by looking

425
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,759
at those leaves you can say um maybe if

426
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,159
it's fading early you can say I'm

427
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,800
nitrogen deficient I got to [ __ ]

428
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,159
start stepping up my nutrients if you

429
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,919
see something happening too soon that

430
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,039
fade can indicate things but most of the

431
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,159
time it's just the plant saying uh hey

432
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,719
it's time for me to end and a lot of

433
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,278
times it's saying I am out of nitrogen

434
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,639
so if you've been uh if you're one of

435
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:33,559
the people that believe in a strong

436
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,759
flush that's controversial to me I don't

437
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,919
flush uh but if you're a flushing kind

438
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,318
of person uh then uh that fade will show

439
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,799
you that your flushing has been

440
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,719
effective basically the fade can mean a

441
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,519
lot of things I'll talk about that but

442
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,120
uh the fade isn't too important to me

443
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,039
I'm not smoking the leaves that's why

444
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,600
the fade doesn't matter uh I'm going to

445
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,278
cut all that faded [ __ ] off whether it's

446
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
bright green whether it's dark green

447
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,480
whether it's faded yellow whether it's

448
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,879
purple I'm going to trim it off I'm not

449
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,879
smoking the leaves I'm going to smoke

450
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,720
the buds and I mainly going for tricomes

451
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,198
is what we're after um we want ripe

452
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,759
tricomes that's my next note or earlier

453
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,039
if you're making hash you want to cut it

454
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,120
down just a little bit earlier so the

455
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,278
fade has a lot of different a lot of

456
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,560
people have a lot of different ideas

457
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,958
about the fade uh the fade could be it's

458
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,638
just basically sin Essence all the

459
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,958
plants outside are fading too because

460
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,278
they know that their time is up we're

461
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,039
growing an annual plant it knows I'm

462
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,318
only going to go for one season and then

463
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,519
it's time to go I'm going to use up all

464
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,919
my resources all my energy I'm going to

465
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,240
go once and then at the end I might

466
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,919
might put on a good fade so what can

467
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,039
affect your fade the feed um have you

468
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,759
been feeding heavily um if you've been

469
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,240
feeding enough you probably if you've

470
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,919
been feeding too much you won't even see

471
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,198
a fade possibly um then like I said

472
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,198
before the fade isn't 100% necessary um

473
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,039
it happens sometimes it happen sometimes

474
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,198
it doesn't I've noticed different times

475
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,480
of year based on the weather uh my

476
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,198
indoor crops May fade more or less than

477
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,240
my other crops my summer crop it gets

478
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,519
real hot here in Colorado it's harder to

479
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,278
get the room cooler not as much colors

480
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,838
the crop happening now it's a little bit

481
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:07,000
colder colorful as all hell so um feed

482
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,639
could be a big difference in your fade

483
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,359
um if your plants have eaten a lot

484
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
they're not going to fade as much they

485
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,038
just might not fade because they're

486
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,720
eating you're feeding them nitrogen

487
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,038
they're going to be bright green you

488
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,160
might prevent the fade that way uh

489
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,959
lighting can change can affect your fade

490
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,439
uh Spectrum intensity distance duration

491
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,318
all of those things can affect your fade

492
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,798
if you're uh putting super bright LEDs

493
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,240
really close of the light they're going

494
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,519
to pale out at the end they're just

495
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,480
going to get more yellow they're going

496
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,200
to uh the next thing temperature of the

497
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,079
room is it cold is it hot those things

498
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,558
can affect your fade you'll notice that

499
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:44,038
colder rooms will get more colorful

500
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,599
leaves also swings how hot is it during

501
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,519
the day how cold is it at night or vice

502
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,079
versa those things will make a

503
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,079
difference on the fade the humidity uh

504
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,158
wet and dry I know it sounds wild but

505
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,399
that wet and dryness the VPD in there is

506
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,000
going to have an effect on the color of

507
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,080
your leaves that is going to have a a

508
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,679
huge effect swings swings in temperature

509
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,720
humidity and VPD overall will have a

510
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,600
huge effect on the colors and the fade

511
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
of your plants here's something you

512
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,359
might not even think about water

513
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,080
temperature the water that you're

514
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,359
feeding that plant how warm or how cold

515
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,480
is that water temperature if you're

516
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,279
feeding those plants cold temps you're

517
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,798
going to get colorful leaves that is a

518
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,960
protector of the plant it'll spit out

519
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:26,279
those anthocyanins it'll get nice and

520
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,159
purple and try to protect itself what

521
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,759
about dryb backs the opposite dryback

522
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,360
may also affect your color and or the

523
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,119
lack thereof your color what about pot

524
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,000
size you might not even think about pot

525
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,839
size what if your plants are rootbound

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,119
they might start fading earlier if

527
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,599
they're rootbound they'll say hey I'm

528
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,479
[ __ ] rootbound I don't know what to

529
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,599
do I'm just going to finish out [ __ ]

530
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,240
eating [ __ ] drinking I'm done with this

531
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,558
I am just going to finish out sometimes

532
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,558
your plants are uh they're locked out

533
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:55,279
you've been feeding them way too much

534
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,839
maybe your pH is off those plants are

535
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,240
going to start fading even more quickly

536
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,918
because they cannot eat so if f is not

537
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,839
always a good sign sometimes it's saying

538
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,880
hey I'm hungry you got to fix an issue

539
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:07,319
help me the [ __ ] out here what else do I

540
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,120
have written down oh the most important

541
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:13,319
thing genetics some plants just will not

542
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,119
fade like if you run lemon Jeffrey it

543
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:19,158
goes from green to Yellow that's all you

544
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:21,439
get just green bright green then yellow

545
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,679
if you run Afterglow that bad [ __ ] will

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,360
go from dark green to light green to

547
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,798
light yellow to bright pink to Orange to

548
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,959
[ __ ] Brown like so it's genetics and

549
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,200
let's talk about uh the cream if you get

550
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,480
a cut of the cream uh that bad [ __ ]

551
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,840
will turn black on you toward the end uh

552
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,880
then it will start to fade like these

553
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,759
reddish cool colors the dark Holo cut

554
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,200
going on it starts a bright green Fades

555
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,759
to Black at the end so it's all about

556
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,440
genetics some of the things the orange

557
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,720
gasm doesn't fade a lot of colors it

558
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,798
goes bright green to just yellow you

559
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,679
could tell you're like that [ __ ] is

560
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,480
yellow I just right at the end yellow

561
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,280
she's done uh sometimes you get an

562
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,640
orange a couple of orange colors some

563
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,639
bright orange Hues out of that orange

564
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,480
gasm but that's a rare one one uh that

565
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,679
also comes with pink pistols so if you

566
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,360
see those golden colored leaves look for

567
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,038
the pink pistols or pay attention to

568
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,240
both of those but a lot of it is

569
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,640
genetics um and a lot of it is just how

570
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,519
you're feeding the plant and

571
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,000
environmental I don't find a fade to be

572
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,879
important it's really beautiful like I

573
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,159
said before I like it for taking photos

574
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,720
and [ __ ] but what is a natural fade that

575
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,760
is when the plant starts to use up all

576
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,679
of its resources uh it starts to

577
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,079
naturally sesse and it starts to change

578
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,720
colors just like the plants outside it's

579
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
done it's an annual plant it's only

580
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,759
supposed to go so many weeks and that

581
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,879
plant knows it so it's going to start

582
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,960
fading when does it naturally occur that

583
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,039
is going to be plant specific that can

584
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,798
be affected by your environment and your

585
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,640
feed um this guy said I don't do a flush

586
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,759
will the plants naturally fade um they

587
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,280
might depending on the genetics

588
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,759
depending on what you're feeding they

589
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,319
just might if you're overfeeding

590
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,079
something they might not but that is

591
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,000
very plant and genetic and phenotype

592
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,439
specific all right my dude I hope I said

593
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,599

645
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,119
question is about rev clones all right

646
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:46,558
this is a popular question this comes up

647
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,439
from time to time it says essentially

648
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,359
cuting that are taken from a flowering

649
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,080
plant and put under a veg lighting cycle

650
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,119
yes that is very popular it said are

651
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,038
there any downsides to this Pro uh

652
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,798
process that you know of besides the

653
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:03,798
extra time that it takes to get these

654
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:05,558
things to revert to Fresh Leaf growth uh

655
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:07,639
are there any downsides using reveg

656
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:09,278
clones okay now then he talks about

657
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,759
breeding no just as long as you let

658
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:13,798
everything grow out of the uh let the

659
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,798
hormones readjust and get back to normal

660
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,240
veg State and get back to the normal

661
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,158
leaves and give it some time there's no

662
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,759
downside to breeding with these let me

663
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,000
touch on the question here what this

664
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,158
person wants to

665
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,880
do uh what I think they want to do

666
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,880
they've got a plant they've put this

667
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,799
plant into flower but they did not take

668
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,360
clones I always recommend take a clone

669
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,960
from every plant before you flower it

670
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,079
sometimes that is not an option I

671
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,240
understand that we're going to hit this

672
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,798
water here because my voice is starting

673
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,720
to fry out but um just bear with me

674
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:42,720
we're not even going to edit

675
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,720
this so my new friend Dan has a plant

676
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,000
and they want to take clones from a

677
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
plant that is in flower I don't know how

678
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,640
long into flower it is but this practice

679
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,480
will work uh you could do this all the

680
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,120
way through flower if you really want to

681
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,798
and it will rev the further into flower

682
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,399
you do this the more time it will take

683
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:09,440
for that plant to rev but anything is

684
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,759
possible so they've got a plant it's in

685
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,278
flower they want to take clones uh

686
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,119
cuting that are taken from a flowering

687
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,839
plant and put under a veg lighting cycle

688
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,678
so they're going to cut these clones

689
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,720
either put it in a dome or put it in an

690
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,960
easy cloner and they're going to use my

691
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
cloning sop that I put up on my Discord

692
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,360
server and I will talk about that

693
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,079
cloning sop in the future uh I want to

694
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,639
go over the SOP Maybe we update it then

695
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,158
we'll do a full podcast about it but

696
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,360
that is coming thank you for the

697
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,200
response about that uh these clones are

698
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,398
called Monster clones or Monster

699
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,038
cropping is what this is known as uh

700
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:41,839
when you take a clone from a flowering

701
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,679
plant and put that in the cloner that is

702
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,000
called a monster clone or Monster

703
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,440
cropping that's what I think that's

704
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,880
called that's what I've always called it

705
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,320
so this is a very useful practice yes

706
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,600
this is very useful like I said you

707
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,079
could do this at any point in the

708
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:56,558
flowering phase the earlier the better

709
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,918
because the longer you wait the longer

710
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,480
it's going to take to Rev

711
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,000
but yes you can do this um essentially

712
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,640
cutting yeah that's possible are there

713
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,880
any downsides the downside is that if

714
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,720
that clone does not successfully root

715
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,760
and rev uh you don't have a backup plan

716
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,919
you'll have to rev the big plant which

717
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,798
is still possible uh depending on how

718
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:19,440
long you waited but that is the downside

719
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,079
is that you don't have a safety net if

720
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,000
this clone does not work that's really

721
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,879
the only downside there is that you're

722
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,839
risking not having that genetic preserve

723
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,278
um so and that's why I take clones

724
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,398
before I put put [ __ ] into flower I wait

725
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,679
till I've Got Roots then I flower it but

726
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:36,398
no no downside there uh can there be

727
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,320
downsides to using R clones to breed

728
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,479
with um no as long as you let everything

729
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,759
grow out and let all the the hormones

730
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,278
get back to their normal let them adjust

731
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,359
to they're growing back in veg and you

732
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,240
don't see any signs of flower and then

733
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,678
wait maybe even one more week then no

734
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,000
there's no downside to this all right my

735
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,840
