enough of the gelato cake batter the

right podcast world if you've been

29
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,658
following along you know that I've been

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,368
doing a long series of grow lessons in a

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,670
previous episode I mentioned that those

32
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,040
lessons were over well I was wrong since

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,978
that time I realized I left out a very

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,140
crucial part of our grow experience we

35
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,599
started off by making a solid plan for

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,489
our grow we thought out our equipment we

37
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,589
thought out our space very well we

38
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,319
thought out our genetics hopefully we

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,118
successfully ran a full garden cycle we

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,398
have harvested we have dried and cured

41
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,469
that product we've got some beautifully

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,228
trimmed up buds you know the one thing I

43
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,539
left out we never smoked this product so

44
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,578
this episode is going to be the smoke

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,560
that [ __ ] episode we've ran a full

46
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,989
garden let's reward ourselves and enjoy

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,969
our finished product there's really

48
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,379
nothing like smoking your own product

49
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:08,758
any flowers that you've grown harvested

50
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,228
trimmed you spent a bunch of time with

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,500
it you've really got some attachment to

52
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,480
it

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,289
there's really a rewarding feeling that

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,048
comes with smoke

55
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:18,030
a crop that you grew I've been drawing

56
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,099
for quite a while I've grown many many

57
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,829
small personal crops I have grown many

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,810
large commercial crops I've done a lot

59
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,239
of Fino hunts of plants that I have bred

60
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,000
I have grown a lot of plants and it is

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,250
still very exciting to me to get to try

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,930
the first little batch of smoke from

63
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,419
each crop that I grow there's something

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,849
very rewarding and very satisfying and

65
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,439
very fun it feels like a kid inside like

66
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:41,878
a kid on Christmas morning I get to try

67
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,408
my new thing you know let's see what

68
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,810
it's like I spent all this time with it

69
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:47,848
and I finally get to enjoy it every time

70
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,158
I do it especially something that I've

71
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:51,869
just bred and it's his first run with it

72
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,638
so I bred something I made some seeds

73
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,349
that grew those seeds out I Fino hunted

74
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,389
those seeds and now I finally have a

75
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:59,429
finished product that is real

76
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,739
satisfaction to me there's nothing like

77
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,959
that feeling so this may be your first

78
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,000
time getting to enjoy this experience I

79
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,859
want this to be a great experience for

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,769
you I want every harvest to be a

81
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,569
wonderful experience for you there's one

82
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,700
thing they can really ruin your

83
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,768
experience when it comes to testing your

84
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,539
cannabis for the first time the one

85
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,819
thing that can really [ __ ] it up is by

86
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,560
being impatient if you cut down your

87
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,259
plants too early they aren't going to be

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,299
the quality you deserve if you dried and

89
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,128
cured your plants in a rushing manner

90
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,159
you are not going to get the quality

91
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:33,448
that you deserve so make sure those

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,789
plants got to finish

93
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,219
make sure your plants were flushed make

94
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,948
sure they were harvested dried and cured

95
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,409
and trimmed correctly let's not try to

96
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,689
smoke our first crop too early and put a

97
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,579
bad taste in our mouth literally about

98
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,229
our new crop you're gonna take a bud

99
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,639
you're gonna dry it fast you're gonna

100
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,899
try to smoke it it's gonna taste like

101
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,430
[ __ ] and you're gonna feel like [ __ ]

102
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,439
about your whole crop you're gonna have

103
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,230
just a bad feeling about it you spent

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,509
all this time be patient let each bud be

105
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,459
ready before you smoke them so the first

106
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,918
thing we need to test before we get down

107
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,930
to smoking this product is is it ready

108
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,659
is it dry enough have you dried and

109
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,400
cured this product properly before we go

110
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,530
putting it in a grinder and try to roll

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,680
it up or put it in a pipe it is

112
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,108
acceptable for a cured herb to be kind

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,239
of sticky and a little bit moist that is

114
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,949
the way a lot of people like it you

115
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,598
don't get a lot of that in the Colorado

116
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,490
area because we have what is known as

117
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,029
the Colorado crunch here and I do plan

118
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,400
to do a

119
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,379
Podcast all about the Colorado crunch in

120
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,849
the future but let's stay focused let's

121
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,740
talk about your dried and cured herb

122
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,050
before we smoke it it may be a little

123
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,418
spongy it may be a little sticky if you

124
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,430
have cured it properly that is okay you

125
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,620
may need to take a couple of nugs out of

126
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,660
the jar and set them on the table for

127
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,629
three four maybe five or six hours

128
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,270
before you decide to smoke it is not

129
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:54,120
uncommon to see a connoisseur smoker

130
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:56,519
pull out his jar of nugs crack the lid

131
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,120
take out three or four nuggets set him

132
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,159
on the table

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,079
seal the jar up put it back in his

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,939
little stash spot and then leave those

135
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,949
Nuggets on the table throughout the day

136
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,649
and that's what we smoke on as the day

137
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,449
goes by they may be a little bit damp as

138
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,339
soon as we pull them out of the jar but

139
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,360
as the day goes on they're gonna dry out

140
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,489
perfectly

141
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,210
to roll a fat joint and pack a couple of

142
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,000
bowls so make sure your herb is cured

143
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,620
and dry enough to burn properly so you

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,439
don't disappoint yourself with your

145
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,300
first experience now if you're confident

146
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,219
that your buds are dried and cured and

147
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,740
ready for consumption let's talk about

148
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,070
taking that first taste test of our new

149
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,110
crop for me testing a new product is

150
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,930
sort of a combination between a science

151
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,729
experiment and a ritual I like to be in

152
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,978
my environment I like to use my

153
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:46,709
equipment I like to know what to expect

154
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,959
I like to take away variables that way I

155
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,759
can see what the actual product is

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,589
telling me now I know that may sound

157
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,019
weird to some people but a lot of

158
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,759
stoners are very ritualistic and by

159
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,279
ritualistic I don't mean some fancy

160
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,839
ceremony I just mean I like to be in a

161
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,149
certain place I like to be right here

162
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,829
this is my comfortable smoking place if

163
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,750
you gave me a new concentrate if you

164
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,879
gave me some flour and you said hey I

165
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,918

00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,439
minute another thing that is really fun

224
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,990
to involve your friends in is if you do

225
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,430
a Fino hunt so if you grew five seeds

226
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,168
you've probably got five different

227
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,968
phenotypes or maybe two or three

228
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:08,250
different phenotypes to select from

229
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:10,589
out of those five it's always fun to

230
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,060
load up five balls or roll five joints

231
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,379

232
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,750
of the filter right number one number

233
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,949

bring your friends around to consume

242
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,468

244
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,829
ritual do you want that to happen with

245
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,228
friends around or do you want that to be

246
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,120
a little isolated situation I could go

247
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,038
both ways in my little comfort zone

248
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,019
right here there are two chairs right in

249
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,730
front of me where Mike is always invited

250
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,049
Kevin likes to take this spot right here

251
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,579
there are several other folks that come

252
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:52,019
over and smoke they're always invited

253
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:53,338
that's always fun to me I've got a

254
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,360
couple other chairs we can pull out if

255
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,980
it gets crowded

256
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,209
I like to smoke with friends I don't

257
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,860

258

259
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,999

260
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:05,188
but think about that do you want some

261
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:06,959

269
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:26,938
steps I've gotten ahead of myself let's

270
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,499

00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:39,448

280
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:49,649
you trim it better next time by looking

put a lot of work into it I think the

287
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,839
next step is to give it a little bit of

288
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:05,159
a squeeze yeah you may break it up a

289
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,839
little bit that's fine we're about to

290
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,969

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,879
can destroy this but it is yours enjoy

299
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,519

grinder is really hard to spin your buds

329
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:27,578
may be too wet when you open up that

330
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:29,228
grinder if it's a little moist in there

331
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:31,538
you'll be able to tell at this point if

332
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:33,069
that one bud is a little bit too wet

333
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:34,899
you still need to let the rest of the

334
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:37,118
buds dry and cure just a little bit

335
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,859
longer don't worry you can dry them a

336
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,489
little bit more and you will be just

337
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,319
fine

338
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:43,538
now if you feel like the bud that you

339
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:45,308
have ground up is ready to consume let's

go to smoke a bong load and the water

373
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:47,619
looks like muck and I will not smoke a

374
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:49,658
bowl so just change the bong water clean

375

382
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:04,868
joint rolled you've got a bong load

383
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:06,519
packed you've got a pipe loaded maybe

384
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,649
you filled up the vaporizer maybe you've

385
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,168
got a volcano bag going on however you

386
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:14,589
decided to do it now it is time to take

387
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:17,318
our first puff of our freshly dried and

388
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:19,040
cured cannabis crop like I said earlier

389
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,479
I recommend this being your first

390
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,599
puff of the day that way you know

391
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,789
exactly what your herb does to you we

392
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,820
have now come to my favorite part of the

393
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:31,639
entire process it is now time to smoke

394
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,639
the first sample of our newly harvested

395
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,528
crop so if you rolled up a joint now's

396
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,329
the time to spark it up if you packed up

397
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,889
a bowl now is the time to start taking a

398
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:41,719
couple of puffs if you've got the

399
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,909
vaporizer going now's the time to start

400
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,500
taking a couple of pools take a couple

401
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:47,419
of pools a couple of draws a couple of

402
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,190
totes off your new product and sit back

403
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:51,708
for a couple of seconds and let it sit

404
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,329
in and see what it does to you I don't

405
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,828
know how much you consume but depending

406
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:57,078
on your consumption level you should

407
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:58,519
probably be able to take two three maybe

408
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,778
four good draws or whatever you're

409
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,339
smoking on if you're smoking a joint

410
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:03,289
maybe two or three good draws if you're

411
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,850
smoking a bowl maybe two or three maybe

412
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,958
three or four good puffs off of that if

413
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,459
you're hitting the bong hopefully you

414
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,689
only need one or two good bong rips

415
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,088
before you start feeling it

416
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,680
I find vaporizers to be unpredictable I

417
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,079
never know if I'm gonna need 1 or 6

418
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,669
pools off the vaporizer but take as many

419
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,318
as you're comfortable with get a little

420
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:20,299
buzz on and sit back for a couple of

421
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:22,669
seconds and just see what happens

422
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,588
are you stoned did you get mallow did

423
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:27,439
you get low are you high did you get

424
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:29,870
giggly and goofy are you paranoid do you

425
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,339
have the munchies how do you feel give

426
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,659
it a couple of seconds if you've got

427
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,220
other friends in the room start

428
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,600
conversation you guys will start talking

429
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,370
about the product you start talking

430
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,819
about the herb somebody will mention the

431
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,370
taste

432
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:42,049
somebody will mention the aroma

433
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,629
conversation will start pay attention to

434
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,399
how your friends react to your herb make

435
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:48,559
a mental note of what you think of the

436
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,299
herb do you like it do you like the

437
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,948
aroma do you like the flavor

438
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:54,439
do you like the buzz that you've gotten

439
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:56,088
from the way you've consumed it now it

440
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,680
may be time to take a couple of more

441
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,389
puffs and go to the next level

442
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,189
now what do you think now that you've

443
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,350
pushed it a little bit how do you feel

444
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,029
now are you super stoned or you stuck to

445
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,319
the couch or eve flying off the couch

446
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:08,929
and just hanging on for dear life

447
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:11,000
how's it making you feel how's it acting

448
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,948
to your friends are they lit are they

449
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,149
bored see how they're enjoying it pay

450
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,188
attention to the words that they're

451
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,828
saying and try to make a mental note of

452
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:20,448
their review of your product now let's

453
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:22,519
talk about a few things to look for

454
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:24,289
while you are smoking your first sample

455
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,688
let's look for some things about the

456
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:29,059
product to pay attention to how does

457
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:31,068
your product burn does it burn smoothly

458
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,389
did it burn like a charcoal briquette or

459
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:34,729
did it burn a nice why

460
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,319
ash if the ash that you knocked off the

461
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,639
end of your joint or that chunk that you

462
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,560
dumped out of your bowl at the end if

463
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,120
that was chunky and black you may not

464
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,549
have flushed your product long enough

465
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,740
you may want a longer flush time also

466
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,809
you may not have dried it properly it

467
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,610
may still be a little bit wet if it's

468
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:51,649
not burning properly it could still be a

469
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,370
little moist and it needs more dry time

470
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:57,740
so pay attention to how it burns also

471
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,870
how does it smoke is the smoke nice and

472
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,240
smooth is that smoke thick and harsh

473
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,549
does it hurt your throat does it make

474
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,289
you cough or can you just toke on it all

475
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,240
day and blow clouds and it doesn't

476
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,649
bother your lungs and throat at all pay

477
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,139
attention to that you can make

478
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,079
improvements in your next grow based on

479
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:17,480
the quality of this product how is the

480
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,639
flavor how is the aroma are those things

481
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,670
on point because if the flavor and aroma

482
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,039
and burn factor are not on point you can

483
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:27,409
absolutely correct those in your next

484
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,730
grow I was talking about paying

485
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,949
attention to what your friends say

486
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,340
because they are going to be honest with

487
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,080
you

488
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,639
you're going to be very proud of your

489
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,080
crop you spend a lot of time on this

490
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,179
you're going to think it is the best

491
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,800
herb you've ever smoked that is a very

492
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:42,709
natural thing for new growers

493
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,899
to experience listen to your friends

494
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,540
they smoke a lot of herb also they're

495
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,879
going to have very influential feedback

496
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,620
don't let their criticism hurt your

497
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,149
feelings you're going to take their

498
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,070
compliments when one of your friends

499
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,019
says brother this [ __ ] smells so good I

500
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,420
can't believe you grew this you're gonna

501
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,490
glow when the other guy says bro this

502
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,589
kind of burns my throat you have to take

503
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,440
that compliment just as strongly as you

504
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,420
did or that criticism as strongly as you

505
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,420
did that compliment they both matter

506
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,400
equally so use the compliment as a

507
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,589
driving force to move you forward use

508
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,019
the criticism as a way to improve your

509
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:19,429
crop next time don't be hurt when one of

510
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,959
your friend says bro that we burns my

511
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,759
throat that's cuz you did something

512
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,259
wrong and you need to improve and he was

513
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,599
honest with you because he's a good

514
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,160
friend I mentioned earlier that some of

515
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,689
the things that you may need to improve

516
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,210
that you'll notice right away are your

517
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,340
flush how is that product burning again

518
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,650
is it a dark chunk or is it a nice white

519
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:38,209
clean ash does it burn all the way

520
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,130
through the joint or do you need to keep

521
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,779
relighting it if it's burning a real

522
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,550
black and chunky and you need to keep

523
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,990
relighting it you probably needed to

524
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,428
flush longer if

525
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,230
just keeps going out but it's not

526
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,179
burning real black it may just be too

527
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,849
wet and you need to dry and cure it a

528
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,890
little bit longer how was your cure

529
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,619
process does the herb taste good

530
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,290
does it smell good is it crunchy is it

531
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:02,419
dry is it moist did you dry and cure it

532
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,308
to your liking do your friends think you

533
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,750
dried and cured it properly what do you

534
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:07,339
think as long as you're happy that's

535
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,960
what matters as long as you were

536
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:11,329
consuming it if it's going to market

537
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,210
it's got to satisfy the market so pay

538
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:16,129
attention to what the market says also

539
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,039
how did you trim it are you satisfied

540
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,170
with the trim are your clients satisfied

541
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,079
with the trim maybe you can improve on

542
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,210
the trim a lot of new growers don't trim

543
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,759
enough in my opinion you could go a

544
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,410
little bit harder on your trim job now

545
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,029
that you were consuming the product and

546
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,679
you can actually tell what type of buzz

547
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,660
it gives you do you think you should

548
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,980
have flowered a little bit longer or do

549
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,679
you think you should have flowered a

550
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,480
little bit shorter if you pay attention

551
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,730
to the finished product and how things

552
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,589
came out this time if you took plenty of

553
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,880
notes throughout the grow you can look

554
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,529
at your notes you can look at your

555
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,150
finished product and you can see things

556
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:52,639
that you can improve for the next run

557
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,410
which will make you a better grower so

558
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
take all of those compliments and take

559
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,700
all of that criticism and ball it all up

560
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,130
into one big learning lesson and think

561
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,440
of ways to improve your crop next time

562
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,120
now the overall deciding factor on the

563
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,670
quality of this product is how do you

564
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,889
feel do you like it were you going for a

565
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,660
low couch lock kind of a buzz or were

566
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,490
you going for a big psychedelic head

567
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,650
spinning hi and did you get what you

568
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,329
were after do you think if you would

569
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,890
have let that plant flower a little bit

570
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,599
longer that you would have gotten better

571
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,370
quality do you think maybe you would

572
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,869
have gotten a fatter yield do you think

573
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,189
maybe if you have chopped it a little

574
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,259
later that it may have started to

575
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,970
diminish the flavor do you think if you

576
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:30,558
were to cut it a little bit earlier that

577
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,808
it would have been a little more head

578
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,009
buzzy and a little bit racier there are

579
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:35,808
things to think about as you were

580
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,579
testing the final product are you

581
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,259
satisfied with your finished product is

582
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:41,808
the bottom line if you're satisfied

583
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:44,000
don't change a thing if there are things

584
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:45,678
that you're not satisfied with look at

585
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,259
your notes and think of ways that you

586
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,630
can improve those things for your next

587
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:53,029
run now I started off our little science

588
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,679
experiment slash ritual of testing our

589
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,779
first crop by sitting in our little

590
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,880
comfortable environment cannabis

591
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,440
consumers stoners

592
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,780
heads whatever you want to call us I'm

593
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,390
okay with all of the above we have this

594
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:06,980
tendency to smoke and get trapped in our

595
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,420
little spot we don't want to go anywhere

596
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,519
we're nice and comfortable here like I

597
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,680
said earlier the music is just right the

598
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,599
air-conditioner is just right the fridge

599
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,220
is full of snacks my bros are right here

600
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:18,619
at the table why would I want to go

601
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,480
anywhere why because when you step out

602
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,819
of this little comfort zone you may be

603
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,190
twice as stoned as you even noticed it's

604
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:27,740
really easy to smoke a whole bunch of

605
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,210
product and sit here and be blazed out

606
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,009
of your mind to be comfortable because

607
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,240
this is the zone you know where

608
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,559
everything is I know there's a drink

609
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,789
right here I know the dad rig is right

610
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,009
here I know the pen is right here I know

611
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,920
where everything is there's no chaos

612
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:40,430
right here maybe go somewhere go for a

613
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,170
walk

614
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,330
maybe call an uber and have them take

615
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,680
you to the mall or to the park just go

616
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:47,419
somewhere just get out of the house

617
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,310
maybe just go get some food some more

618
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,170
with your bros and just get out of the

619
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,000
house while your freshly buzzed on that

620

to you out there there's this thing

623
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,650
about stoners that once you smoke you've

624
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,670
got about 10 minutes if you don't get up

625
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,050
and leave in 10 minutes

626
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,570
you're [ __ ] stuck wherever you just

627
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,619
smoke so smoke a little bit if you're

628
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:08,599
comfortable just hanging out at the

654
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,670
does cost me a little bit of money to

655
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,900
host the website every year so I do pay

656
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,539
for that out of the patreon

657
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,820
contributions I also use last year's

658
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,619
patreon contributions to fund the

659
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:08,929
MacBook that I am using to record the

660
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,399
show on right now I also use some of the

661
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,080
patreon funding for a little microphone

662
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,009
covers and for equipment that breaks

663
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,389
occasionally

664
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:16,579
had to replace this headphone amp a

665
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,380
couple of times I buy memory cards and

666
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,750
things like that with the funding from

667
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,370
patreon so it mainly pays to the podcast

668
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,259
and the equipment and the little

669
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,179
microphone covers so I want to thank you

670
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,890
guys for contributing to patreon and I

671
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,230
