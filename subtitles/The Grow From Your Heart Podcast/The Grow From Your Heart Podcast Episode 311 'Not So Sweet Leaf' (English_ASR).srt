00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,500

73
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,340
the exact thing I've been in love with

74
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,959
lately I've been so in love with the

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,090
star dog lately that I crossed it to a

76
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,560
rise and I came up with the name I've

77
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,390
been trying to struggle for a name for

78
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,068
it and I was in an Instagram live feed

79
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,299
the other day and one of our friends who

80
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:44,219
I'm not sure if he wants his name said

81
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,260
on a podcast but he shouted out or he

82
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,689
typed out I guess he typed out

83
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,269
starstruck and I'm going with it

84
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,000
starstruck is awesome starting to arise

85
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,189
that is called starstruck so coming soon

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,469
to a seed bank near you starstruck all

87
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,239
right so we got starstruck named we got

88
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,150
blueberry cookies crosses available and

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,259
I am smoking star dog ambrosia I think

90
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,480
we've covered all the business for the

91
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,068
start of the podcast let's get into the

92
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,899
main topic if you pay attention to the

93
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:12,869
podcast you have probably heard me talk

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,209
about a dispensary known as sweet leaf

95
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,800
sweet leaf is a chain of dispensaries in

96
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,009
Colorado that got in trouble for doing

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,390
something known as looping now before we

98
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,578
get too far I'll tell you what looping

99
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,139
is in the state of Colorado when you buy

100
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,640
recreational cannabis you were allowed

101
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,069
to buy one ounce at a time per

102
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,589
transaction now a lot of people found

103
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,049
that word per transaction as a loophole

104
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,840
they would buy an ounce of cannabis they

105
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,310
would then drive around the block or

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,659
maybe just go get lunch or something and

107
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,579
then come right back to the same

108
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,780
dispensary and buy another ounce of

109
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,150
cannabis which means they have now

110
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,079
purchased two ounces of cannabis from

111
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,329
the same dispensary in one day now at

112
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:55,319
some point the marijuana Enforcement

113
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,730
Division sent out a memo saying no more

114
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,159
looping the rule is that you were

115
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:03,090
allowed to sell one ounce of cannabis

116
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,829
per person per day from your facility so

117
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,400
at that time it was expected that

118
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,560
looping would stop it appears allegedly

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
that sweetleaf continued with the

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,168
looping and that puts us kind of in the

121
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,879
article that I've got before me this

122
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,738
article comes from the cannabis and it

123
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,810
was written by Alicia Wallace and it was

124
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,418
originally published on April 30th and

125
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,410
it was updated yesterday and it goes

126
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,089
like this

127
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,010
the sweet leaf dispensary chain shut

128
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,659
down in December after police sting was

129
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,579
a criminal enterprise that pocketed

130
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,380
millions from an illicit looping scheme

131
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,300
that allowed customers to purchase the

132
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,279
maximum amount of marijuana multiple

133
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,340
times in a day a municipal hearing

134
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,109
officer has ruled as a result sweet leaf

135
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,448
marihuana sinners could be stripped of

136
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,370
its 26 retail cultivation and

137
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,870
manufacturing licenses according to

138
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,689
recommendations released Monday by

139
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,120
Denver hearing officer Suzanne phasing

140
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,189
sweet leaf scheme at the very least

141
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,168
permitted the unlawful possession by its

142
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,269
customers and it's scheme was not the

143
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,719
action of a reasonable licensee she

144
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,728
wrote

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,680
not only did sweetly fail to take action

146
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:09,050
to stop the illegal purchases but it

147
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,000
actively aided and abetted the illegal

148
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,490
purchases through it's looping scheme

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,110
Ashley Kilroy the city's director of

150
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,538
Marijuana Policy will have the final say

151
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,370
on sweet leaves faith following a 10-day

152
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:20,779
period for objections and a 5-day period

153
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,180
for a response

154
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,299
gilroys determination could come in the

155
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,829
next few weeks officials for the city of

156
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,210
Denver said sweet leaf could not be

157
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,339
immediately reached for comment

158
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,228
sweet Leafs licenses were suspended on

159
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,299
December 14th when police raided eight

160
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:37,089
sweetly facilities in Denver and Aurora

161
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,990
following a year-long undercover

162
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,538
investigation into illegal marijuana

163
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,370
sales more than a dozen arrests of bud

164
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,949
tenders and customers have been made in

165
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,629
connection with the case the

166
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,519
investigation zeroed in on alleged

167
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,319
incidents of looping in which sweet leaf

168
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,089
bud tenders would make repeated sales of

169
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,769
up to one ounce of recreational

170
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,448
marijuana the maximum allowed for

171
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:59,089
individual possession under Colorado law

172
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,038
to the same customer multiple times in

173
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,629
one day

174
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,978
looping accounted for at least six point

175
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,870
seven million dollars of medical

176
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,550
marijuana sales in the 18-month period

177
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,160
that ended when the stores were shut

178
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,960
down and at least 1.5 million dollars in

179
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,030
recreational marijuana sales according

180
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,279
to the hearing officers report at least

181
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:18,739
half of the loopers had out-of-state ids

182
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,159
phasing wrote she found that people from

183
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,079
Arkansas Nebraska New Mexico and Texas

184
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,150
purchased large amounts of marijuana to

185
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,639
resell illegally in their home states

186
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:30,288
some of those customers were convicted

187
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,970
of criminal charges after being arrested

188
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:34,430
with multiple pounds of sweet leaf

189
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,599
marijuana in their possession now I'm

190
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,038
sure a lot of people are gonna go how

191
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,228
can they prove that that was sweet leaf

192
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,069
marijuana well because when you buy

193
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:42,529
something

194
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,329
from a dispensary it comes very nicely

195
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,099
packaged but then they put a sticker on

196
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,539
it with their logo right on it I'm

197
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,180
looking at a couple of containers

198
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,550
I've got apothecary farms logos all over

199
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,680
my table I've got a Three Rivers logo

200
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,180
right here I've got a whole pie I've got

201
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
a cut above logos right here they could

202
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,600
tell where all of my products came from

203
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,430
and if you couldn't tell by the logo on

204
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,840
it there's a number on it every one of

205
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,400
these packages let's see if I can find

206
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,099
it on here there it is right there it's

207
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,219
actually got the dispensary the address

208
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,560
the city the zip code the phone number

209
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,320
followed by the MMC number the Medical

210
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,850
Marijuana Center the 402 dash number

211
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,069
that number right there indicates

212
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,740
exactly where that came from so it's

213
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,240
that back that's how they know where it

214
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,590
came from they know what day that was

215
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,970
grown they know what day that was

216
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,949
purchased if any of those stickers are

217
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,960
on there all the details are right there

218
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,490
and a lot of people out of state they

219
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,199
want that labeling on there because it

220
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,030
makes the product worth more that came

221
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,039
from Colorado it's got labels on it

222
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,049
that's a quality product the price goes

223
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,550
up so people are [ __ ] up there taking

224
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,829
those labels with them that's how they

225
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,300
know that it was sweet leaf product all

226
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:48,469
right let's move on with the article

227
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,360
where was I facing her testimony in

228
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,640
sweet leaves case over several days and

229
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,160
March and April essential a central

230
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,949
issue raised then was what constituted a

231
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,170
transaction Colorado's marijuana rules

232
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:02,750
were amended on January 1st to define a

233
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,850
single transaction as including multiple

234
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,769
transfers to the same consumer during

235
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,570
the same business day where the retail

236
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,310
marijuana store employee knows or

237
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,349
reasonably should know that such

238
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,149
transfer would result in that consumer

239
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,910
possessing more than one ounce of

240
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,769
marijuana sweet Leafs attorneys argued

241
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,530
that Colorado marijuana rules in place

242
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:23,389
prior to January 1st did not explicitly

243
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,029
prohibit the sale of more than one ounce

244
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,550
of recreational marijuana per day but

245
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,609
rather it barred any single sale of more

246
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,019
than one ounce of recreational pot

247
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,729
multiple transaction to the same person

248
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,579
would not have been in violation of

249
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,259
state law they said fazing disagreed

250
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,509
citing a marijuana Enforcement Division

251
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,979
public notice that outlined how sales

252
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,139
that are structured as multiple

253
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,990
standalone transactions may be viewed as

254
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:51,289
an attempt to evade quantity limitations

255
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,480
on the sale of recreational marijuana

256
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,338
sweet Leafs owners matthew aiken

257
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,350
christian johnson and anthony saguaro

258
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,970
encouraged and directed the practice of

259
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,430
looping including training new employees

260
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,379
to allow looping for retail customers if

261
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,870
the customer left the premise after each

262
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,208
purchase she wrote evidence cited by

263
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,100
phasing included messages from

264
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,929
management on sweet leave slack channel

265
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,569
promoting multiple sales to the same

266
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,250
customer looping is going to be going on

267
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:18,318
and tell the new year most likely they

268
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,448
wrote please talk it up with extended

269
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:22,338
plant count patience we need med sales

270
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:24,500
up the evidence is clear in this case

271
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,690
that respondents implemented a looping

272
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,448
scheme that was intended to evade

273
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:33,170
quantity limitations on the sale of

274
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:35,328
retail marijuana she said so it looks

275
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,578
like there's a huge chance that sweet

276
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:39,250
leaf will lose all of these licenses and

277
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,629
if that happens there will be a lot of

278
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,129
hot license is up for sale we're gonna

279
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:46,068
see some changes in the game when that

280
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,139
comes but it looks like a lady by the

281
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,759
name of Ashley Kilroy has the final say

282
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,860
on what's going on

283
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,500
looks like they get a 10-day period for

284
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,930
objections and then a five-day period

285
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,000
for a response and it looks like they

286
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:01,219
say the determination could come in the

287
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,259
next few weeks you guys I will do my

288
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,639
best to keep everybody updated and I

289
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,230
want to give Mike a huge shout-out for

294
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,620
Colorado if you live in southern

295
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,929
Colorado you know about the Miller moth

296
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,578
season every year on southern Colorado

297
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:21,349
we get invaded by these little moths

298
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,599
that fly around all of your lights they

299
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,399
come out of nowhere ah the first one

300
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,610
just arrived in my house I just flew

301
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,509
around the light it has begun they're

302
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,068
really not that bad they're just

303
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,269
annoying they fly around all the lights

304
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,039
all the time and when they bump into the

305
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,230
lights all that moth dust that butterfly

306
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,179
dust comes off their wings so you gotta

307
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,649
just keep [ __ ] covered up and honestly I

308
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,909
start turning off more light so it

309
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,278
helped me remember to turn off all the

310
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:44,509
damn lights I got to cover up all the

311
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,919
hash on the table I can't have any

312
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,049
concentrates open cuz I don't want that

313
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,179
moth dust in my concentrates I think

314
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,799
that's disgusting the worst part is when

315
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,028
they get in the damn grow room because

316
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,789
they just want to fly around your light

317
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,230
and all on the light they smack the if

318
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,879
you got glass over the light like I've

319
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,860
got vented lights they bounce all over

320
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,028
that and if you don't have glass over

321
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,629
the lights they fly into the [ __ ]

322
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,580
bulb and cook themselves and it smells

323
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:08,889
so yeah they're annoying more than

324
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,930
