and explaining what 710 is all about

67
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,959
what is 710 let's just jump right into

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,280
it many of you probably already know

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,719
about 420 if you're watching this show

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,878
if you're a cannabis consumer if you're

71
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,080
part of the community you're probably

72
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,840
very familiar with 420 420 is when we

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
celebrate cannabis consumption we like

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
to get together at 420 smoke a bowl it

75
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,280
used to be the the code in high school

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,598
hey bro you want to bust out a little

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,598
420 between classes or meet me at this

78
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,399
place at lunch for a little bit of 420

79
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,799
or meet me at 420 for some 420. it was

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,959
just kind of cool to smoke down at 4 20.

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,719
so 420 got super popular we all know

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
about that if you haven't listened to my

83
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,120
podcast about 420 it was started by a

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
group of young men who called themselves

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
the waldos they would meet every day

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
after school at 4 20 and smoke together

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
it kind of stuck that's why my friends

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,119
and i a bunch of the grateful dead

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
community is where it got popular then

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,878
it traveled around a bunch of my friends

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,039
and myself we all started saying 420

92
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,878
everybody around us was saying 420. it

93
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,679
got super popular then we started seeing

94
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,120
420 festivals and 420 events it got

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
really commercialized with the

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,319
legalization of cannabis so that is

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,680
where 420 came from and 420 got popular

98
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,359
now let's segue into 710 what is 710

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
with the evolution of cannabis

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,599
legalization has also come the evolution

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
of cannabis products one of the greatest

102
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,919
things to come out of this evolution in

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
my opinion is high quality cannabis

104
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,759
concentrates if it's shatter if it's

105
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,878
batter if it's rosin whatever it is i

106
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,479
love a high quality cannabis concentrate

107
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,959
when it first started getting popular

108
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,560
bho concentrates were known as oil they

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,959
would come out looking like honey oil

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
bho butane honey oil

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
i'm not going to tell you how it's done

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,158
but you would use butane and some

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,158
products and the resulting product would

114
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,039
look like oil and it would look like

115
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,479
honey they call it butane honey oil we

116
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,879
learned how to refine it do a bunch of

117
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,000
different things to it but that bho that

118
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,680
butane honey oil i looked like oil so

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
they were calling it oil then we

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,478
realized that if you turn the number 710

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
upside down on the clock it does spell

122
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,680
the word oil seven one zero flip it

123
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,638
upside down it says oil that's why at 7

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,600
10 we smoke some oil that's why 710 has

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,759
become the new 420 so that's why 710 has

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
become the new 420 we have upgraded a

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
little bit

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
i do find that 710 is a little bit more

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,439
convenient a lot of the time uh compared

130
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,599
to 420 it takes me

131
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,360
uh much less time to prepare and consume

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,439
a dab than it does to uh prepare and

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
consume as much cannabis as it would to

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,639
get me where i want to be and also

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
there's not as much aroma if you take a

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
dab some of the dabs i've got on the

137
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,079
table smell like straight up candy so if

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,519
i hit this blue fruit right here it's

139
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
not going to smell like i just smoked a

140
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,478
blunt in the room it's not going to

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,000
smell like i smoked a fat joint it's

142
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,360
going to smell like this fruity blue

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,360
candy incense potpourri delightful air

144
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
freshener stuff so it may be a little

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
bit easier to conceal and it makes it a

146
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,599
little bit more convenient for a lot of

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,639
reasons now we've talked about what 710

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,479
means 710 is simply oil upside down it

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,038
is when we smoke a dab so a lot of you

150
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,478
have that 420 alarm set on your phone

151
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,519
when 420 comes you all got to get

152
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,918
together and smoke a ball bro at 7 10 we

153
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,079
take dabs in colorado so that's 7 10 a

154
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,719
lot of places are taking dabs at 7 10.

155
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,918
definitely here in colorado so 710 is

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,600
oil upside down and that is dab time i

157
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,758

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
shout out to our friends from

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
healthstone glass there may have been

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
other people in the room but to the best

166
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,000
of my knowledge there was a meeting and

167
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,000
people were talking about the new term

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,079
and i think taskrock is the one who

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,918
coined the phrase 710. so i'm going to

170
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,240
go ahead right here on the show and give

171
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,478
credit to task for coining the phrase

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
710 i want to make sure that he got that

173
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,079
now when we talk about 710 i keep saying

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
the word dab

175
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,279
many people might not even know what a

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,279
dab is what is a dab a dab when i talk

177
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,679
about a dab a dab is a hit of a

178
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,198
concentrate uh a hit of a cannabis

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,280
concentrate just a hit just one

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
consumption the reason why we call it a

181
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,399
dab let me just go ahead and get out a

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
dab here i'm going to open a brand new

183
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,799
package of blue fruit live batter from

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,399
green dot labs nobody pays me to talk

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
about this product but i'm just going to

186
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,799
talk about it for the fun of it since

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
we're here

188
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,439
this is blue fruit live batter

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
this is a blend of sex on the beach and

190
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,360
black and blue two different strains

191
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,519
extracted together in the same machine

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,680
and the same device on the same run that

193
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,959
makes one great tasting concentrate they

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,439
do describe the flavor of this

195
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,519
concentrate as blueberry cheesecake and

196
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,918
exotic fruit on the back it says it

197
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,240
contains

198
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:08,639
74.99 thc and non-detectable amounts of

199
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
cbd there's a little pull here tab we

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
can pull this and probably get more

201
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
information if we open this up i don't

202
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,598
usually do that but let's see what's in

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
here all right through the magic of

204
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,680
editing i got that really quickly when i

205
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
open the little book on the back of the

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,199
package here i've never done this with

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
this brand i don't think i pop it open

208
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
and it says oh we should talk about this

209
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,240
it does say the um the grow where it was

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
grown and it says the infused product

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
place where it was uh processed it's got

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
those two numbers on there you can't see

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,439
the numbers but i see them there's a 403

214
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
r and a 404 r number if you have any

215
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,160
problem with this product they could

216
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
trace this product back to that

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
cultivation facility and that extraction

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,240
lab so it's cool that they've got that

219
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
on there just wanted to mention that it

220
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,680
goes on inside this little book it says

221
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,000
extracted using 99.9 percent distilled

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,319
and butane this product was produced

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,959
without regulatory oversight for health

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
safety or efficacy this product complies

225
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,638
with testing requirements there may be

226
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,879
long-term physical or

227
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,038
mental health risks from use of

228
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,360
marijuana including additional risks for

229
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,839
women who are or may become pregnant or

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,439
are breastfeeding use of marijuana may

231
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,560
impair your ability to drive a car or

232
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,918
operate machinery intended use inhaled

233
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,598
product and i think that is the end of

234
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,439
the book here that's the end of the

235
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,279
story so it does come with a nice little

236
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,879
uh warning label a bunch of stuff on the

237
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,918
inside here then we're going to crack

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,439
this open we are getting to the point

239
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,598
oh it smells so good it smells

240
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,559
disgustingly good the concentrate's

241
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,560
definitely this batter definitely has a

242
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,478
really concentrated aroma in there as

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,598
well i'm going gonna try to show you

244
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,879
this i don't know what you can see i

245
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
don't want to lose my concentrates i

246
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,679
just bought this i don't want to fall

247
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,000
out of the jar there but i want to put

248
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,759
it up on the camera for you

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
um i'll pick it up i shouldn't do that

250
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,799
but i'll kind of grab it show you that's

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,720
a gram of green dot batter i don't know

252
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,958
if it'll focus on that or not but we'll

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
try i'll try to zoom in and editing

254
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,559
there it is we'll put it in there

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,959
i'm going to show you why we call it a

256
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,879
dab when we take a dab we go like this

257
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,759
we scoop out just a little piece and

258
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,039
most people would take

259
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,639
i don't know if you can even see it on

260
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,480
there because it's just a dab you just

261
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,000
get a little dab just a little dab will

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
do you that's kind of a big dab that

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
would make mike cough i'm not going to

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
show off i'm not trying to brag but this

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
is the size of dab that i would normally

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
do here

267
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,319
um scoop this up a little bit i know i'm

268
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
not talking into the mic but this is the

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,920
kind of dab that i would normally do

270
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,679
something about this size ah that's

271
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,958
that's a decent sized dab i'm gonna do

272
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,039
that while we're here on the podcast in

273
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,719
a minute so um

274
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,360
that's the size dab i would normally do

275
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,120
so we scoop up a dab a dab is a hit of a

276
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,639
concentrate now let me talk about what

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
is a concentrate maybe concentrate

278
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,639
doesn't even make any sense

279
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
when we have cannabis we have dried

280
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,399
cannabis flower tops that's usually what

281
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
we consume we cut off the tops we cut

282
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
off the leaves we dry and cure the tops

283
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
and then we smoke those

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,480
we don't need all of the green leafy

285
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
matter the vegetable part doesn't really

286
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
do anything for us that is the carrier

287
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,879
for the potent part the trichomes the

288
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,159
little the crystals you guys call them

289
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,879
the little mushrooms that are growing

290
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,319
off the weed plants uh those are where

291
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,559
the potency is hidden most of the

292
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
potency is in the cap of that trichome

293
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,039
through science and technology people

294
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,440
have learned how to basically rinse or

295
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,199
remove all of that potent part from the

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
green part so that way we don't have to

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,680
smoke uh a bunch of green [ __ ] to get

298
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,679
stoned we can just smoke the important

299
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,000
part we've taken the good part and

300
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,719
washed it off basically using solvents

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
or water we've learned how to just strip

302
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,480
that potent part from the green leafy

303
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
matter and then the green leafy matter

304
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
is discarded the potent part is turned

305
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
into a delicious batter which i do love

306
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,278
to consume so that is what a dab is a

307
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,278
dab is a hit of that concentrate when

308
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,838
the phrase dab first started i think it

309
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,278
did refer to a bho concentrate because a

310
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
lot of this movement

311
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,799
did evolve because of the bho

312
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,559
concentrate movement when cannabis

313
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,240
became legal i don't want to teach you

314
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
too much about bho about butane

315
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,639
extracted products but that is how it is

316
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
done people say it's not there people

317
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,519
are going to say that's not safe that

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
can't be healthy

319
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
butane is very clean we know how to

320
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,480
clean it out of the product there's none

321
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,759
left in here it's lab tested we've been

322
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
doing it for a while we know what we're

323
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,240
doing it's [ __ ] great products rasta

324
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
jeff approved uh so back in the day a

325
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,799
dab was a bho hit now we call it dab

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,799
basically anything if it's rosin if it's

327
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,240
batter if it's shatter uh if you put it

328
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,000
on the dabber and put it in the banger

329
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,879
and take a dab of it that's a dab that's

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
what they'll call it um i just said a

331
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
bunch of words right there that you may

332
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
not even know so i said dabber what's

333
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,919
the dabber the dabber is the little

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
stick that i scoop up the dabber with

335
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,759
that's all it is that's the dabber the

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
stick that i went and put the dab on

337
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,319
this is the dabber also i am a dabber

338
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,519
i'm a person who consumes dabs i am a

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,959
dabber so i've got my dabber um

340
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
just keep talking here there's more to

341
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,039
cover concentrates uh there are a lot

342
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
when i'd say concentrates that means a

343
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,278
lot of different kinds of hash a lot of

344
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,039
you older smokers uh you'll think of

345
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,519
just old school hash

346
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,679
water hash bubble hash that's just basic

347
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,360
hash that is a concentrate you can dab

348
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,519
that but it does make a mess on your

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
banger sometimes uh you can make

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,078
concentrates with dry ice i've seen

351
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,519
people take a sieve bag and dry ice and

352
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,919
product and just shake the [ __ ] out of

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,600
it the dry ice works as a solvent and it

354
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,039
kind of freezes up the it works like how

355
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
you get gum out of your hair it freezes

356
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,879
up the uh the vegetables and then the

357
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,399
crystals fall off basically that's not

358
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,600
exactly but that's the short version of

359
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,000
what happens

360
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
um i've seen people press stuff people

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
can press plenty of stuff into

362
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,638
concentrates they're shatter they're

363
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,399
solventless

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
there's so many different styles and

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,440
preparations of dabs but all of that is

366
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,160
concentrates all of that falls into the

367
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,800
label of hash or concentrates there's a

368
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
very good uh distinction between two

369
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,278
types of concentrates that people really

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,680
do love there is solventless and

371
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,838
solvent-based concentrates people like

372
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,439
to make concentrates with heat i'm sure

373
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
you've heard of people making rosin

374
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
right now people are using uh any kind

375
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,519
of heat and pressure you can use a hair

376
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,278
straightener or a hydraulic press but

377
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
with heat and pressure people are making

378
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,958
raws and they're squeezing the potency

379
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
of the potent part out of the plant

380
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,319
squeezing it right out and getting that

381
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,240
part that is a solvent-less product you

382
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
didn't use any chemicals no solvents

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
were used in the making of that product

384
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,879
also people will consider water hatch to

385
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,799
be solvent-less because yes i do

386
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,039
understand that water is a solvent but

387
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,000
let me try to quote my friend nicoti

388
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,759
here dj nicotine from essential extracts

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,159
has taught us that

390
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,159
when we're making water hash water is

391
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,559
not being used as a solvent because

392
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,719
trichomes are not water soluble it is

393
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,359
being used as an agitator we are using

394
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,519
ice and water to simply wash the

395
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,519
trichomes off of the plant we're not

396
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,919
using it as a solvent so when we use

397
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,639
water and ice to make hash that is

398
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,000
technically solventless concentrates a

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,000
lot of people really like the

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,759
solventless people that have had seizure

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,759
problems some older people they're

402
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,679
afraid of the butane so a lot of those

403
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,360
folks a lot of the younger the rosin

404
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,120
heads they really love the solvent-less

405
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,320
products then there are people like

406
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,078
myself i really love a butane extracted

407
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,120
product the product i'm going to dab was

408
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:12,078
made i said a moment ago with 99.9

409
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,879
pure butane so that's a butane extracted

410
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,679
product um in my opinion the butane

411
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,600
extracted products burn cleaner they

412
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,278
don't leave any residue on the nail they

413
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
don't need they don't leave any mess in

414
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,879
my my rig i think they work a lot better

415
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:30,078
for me i do smoke some rosin green dot

416
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,799
makes an amazing garlic banger rosin it

417
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,198
tastes disgustingly delicious it smells

418
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,519
so grossly good it's like a garlicky

419
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,278
trash can with hints of vomit i love it

420
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
it sounds gross right give me all of it

421
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,759
i'll take four grams right now i love

422
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
that [ __ ] that's a rosin when i smoke

423
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,360
that my lungs feel a little bit heavy it

424
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,198
makes me a little bit

425
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,039
uh it makes all of me heavy it makes me

426
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,958
like want to sit down and like almost

427
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
take a nap it makes my face and my eyes

428
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,799
heavy it almost makes me want to cough

429
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,120
and it leaves a little bit of a [ __ ] on

430
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,240
my banger the rosin doesn't do that the

431
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,078
or the re

432
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,159
the live batter doesn't do that the live

433
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,838
batter gets me a nice head buzz my eyes

434
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,159
perk up i start getting wild i want to

435
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
do some [ __ ] i get active and lively so

436
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,838
that's the big difference between those

437
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,399
two products but i do enjoy both of them

438
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,120
uh just in different ways so the rosin

439
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,679
from green dot is made without any uh

440
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,360
solvents it is heat and water then the

441
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,198
uh the bho the batter is made with the

442
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
butane of course and i do like both of

443
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,039
those so we've talked about solventless

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
and solvent concentrates

445
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,759
let's talk about rigs i've said rig just

446
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,560
a moment ago the thing that you smoke

447
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,199
your oil through is a rig right an oil

448
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,159
rig that's why we call it that i prefer

449
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,919
a little rig this is my dab rig this is

450
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,078
the one i have chosen i've got a lot of

451
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,559
rigs i've got several rigs this is my

452
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,679
favorite rig this is my go-to hitter try

453
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,000
to hold it up here to where you can see

454
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,078
it it's not very big uh it's just big

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,320
enough to where when i put the dab in

456
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,479
the this is a banger when i put the dab

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
into the banger i'll put the carb cap on

458
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
it we'll show you that in a moment the

459
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,320
smoke will travel down through here

460
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,839
through these bubbles i always prefer a

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
something with water if i'm smoking

462
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,519
concentrates i want it to go through

463
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,079
water i'm gonna heat it up pretty hot

464
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,679
i take a pretty uh pretty vicious size

465
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,439
dab so i need some water to cool that

466
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,198
down then it comes up through the water

467
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,839
then i like this really flared out

468
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,439
mouthpiece when i take a dab um if the

469
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,040
mouthpiece is too small i feel like the

470
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,199
concentrates stick to my lips my

471
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,639
mustache my teeth and i don't like that

472
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,039
again i take bigger dabs than the

473
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,879
average bear so i like the flared out

474
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,559
mouthpiece this is my favorite rig in my

475
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,799
collection not the most expensive not

476
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,278
the shiniest the brightest but this one

477
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,240
punches the hardest so i like a rig that

478
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,078
is small uh just enough to get water and

479
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
enough to get the [ __ ] the smoke

480
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,679
cooled off then a nice flared out

481
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,758
mouthpiece something i do pay attention

482
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,638
to when i'm buying the rig is how far

483
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,879
from my eyes and face is the nail or the

484
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,320
banger or the bucket going to be when

485
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,759
i'm trying to take a dab am i going to

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
be able to carve it am i going to be

487
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,159
able to work the banger because i don't

488
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,838
want it right here in my face when i'm

489
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,360
all cross-eyed i don't need it down here

490
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,480
by my fingers where i can't see it i

491
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,480
don't need it up here where i got to

492
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
look up and it's all awkward i like the

493
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,078
way this one sits

494
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,838
so when i'm buying a rig i look for

495
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,038
something kind of small

496
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,798
i look for something with a flared

497
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,318
mouthpiece something that holds water

498
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,359
and something that's not awkward when

499
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,279
i'm going to hit it something that's

500
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,479
comfortable in my hand something that i

501
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,519
can function with i'll show you what i

502
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,360
mean i'm going to put it to my face and

503
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,279
kind of give you an example i like to go

504
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,119
right here

505
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,160
so i can look right into where my banger

506
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,399
is where i'm going to be lining up

507
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
putting my dab into there

508
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,360
i could definitely manage that all the

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,798
time not going to miss not going to go

510
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,079
cross side when they're too close i feel

511
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,160
like i go cross-eyed and it just feels

512
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,599
[ __ ] weird so i like a little rig

513
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,279
this is my rig i could have cleaned it a

514
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,359
little better for you it's got some some

515
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,440
dab residue in there but hey we've been

516
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,279
dabbing that's what the rig is for

517
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,120
so this is the rig

518
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,558
um i talk about this part this is the

519
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,399
banger this part comes off right here

520
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,639
this is a separate purchase

521
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,919
this is a banger this is the part where

522
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,600
you're gonna heat this and then you're

523
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
gonna put your dab in here and then

524
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,959
you'll put the carb cap on i'll show you

525
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,038
the cap the cap fits on right here kind

526
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,079
of swirl it around a little bit what

527
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,558
that does um when the cap goes on

528
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,399
it creates a vacuum now the air cannot

529
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,639
flow inside of this area because i've

530
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,080
just sealed it off i'm also smoking

531
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,600
through here at this time so i'm pulling

532
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,439
air through here there's a small hole in

533
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,519
the cap so i'm not restricting the

534
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
airflow the heat in here now does not

535
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,798
need to be as intense because i've

536
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,720
created a vacuum it's like putting a lid

537
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,480
on the pot i've trapped the heat in here

538
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,640
now my dab will cook at a lower

539
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,120
temperature it'll burn more cleanly more

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
smoothly without so much heat less heat

541
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,839
is a little bit better we're going to

542
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,679
talk about heat and temperature in just

543
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,439
a moment but the less heat on there is

544
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,600
better for your lungs better for your

545
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,200
throat it doesn't burn as bad but the

546
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,558
less heat will work better for you it'll

547
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
taste better it won't mess up your

548
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,440
throat your lungs it'll be a more

549
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,679
enjoyable experience however i do enjoy

550
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
a little bit of an excessively hot dab

551
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,320
so this is my banger one thing i should

552
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
mention

553
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,918
is the sizes of bangers that are

554
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,759
available this is a 14 millimeter i do

555
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,919
believe that 14 millimeter is my

556
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,640
favorite size uh for the joint now that

557
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,799
all depends on the size of the joint on

558
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,200
your rig your rig may have a male or a

559
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,918
female joint this is a male joint on the

560
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,679
rig a female joint on the banger

561
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,000
obviously they meet just like that

562
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,400
they're both 14 millimeters so you got a

563
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
14 millimeter 14 mil male female they

564
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
connect like that this is a 90 degree

565
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,798
banger goes at a 90 so it's nice and

566
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,759
flat let me show you another option

567
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,038
this my friends is a 10 millimeter let

568
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,919
me get it out of here real carefully i

569
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:29,599
don't want to break it it's only 10

570
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
millimeters it's kind of delicate that

571
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,678
one's 10 mil it's a little bit skinnier

572
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,160
it's obviously four millimeters skinnier

573
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,759
that one's also a 90 degree this one is

574
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
a male if you can see the shape on the

575
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,359
end let me hold it over here this one's

576
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,519
got that this one goes in right the

577
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,359
piece that goes in is a male just like

578
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,960
us the piece that goes in that's a male

579
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,639
my rig is a female you see it's got a

580
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,798
hole right there watching me do it a

581
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,320
little bit a little bit of rig porn oh

582
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,160
yeah that just sits in there just like

583
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,918
that in this one i've got let me get

584
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,720
them out of here so i could show you i

585
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,960
have got these little guys little glass

586
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,319
balls we call them terp pearls i'm

587
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,798
holding two of them up to the camera

588
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,918
right now tiny little glass balls i put

589
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,720
these in here then when i take a dab i

590
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,280
use a carb cap a spinner cap that makes

591
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,360
those balls spin around the nail around

592
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,678
inside the banger and what that does is

593
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,519
it stirs my oil it stirs my dab and it

594
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,519
makes it move around so it moves it

595
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,599
around the hot surface of the bottom of

596
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,798
the banger and my i get the whole dab i

597
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,399
don't waste any of it i don't get a

598
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,759
little puddle that didn't get roasted up

599
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,880
for me so that is a 10 millimeter uh

600
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,960
banger with a male joint on the banger

601
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,440
and the one we've got over here is a 14

602
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,159
millimeter male oh i may have done that

603
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,360
wrong this is a female 14 millimeter

604
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,760
female 14 mil and then we've got a male

605
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,279
10 mil over there this is my i like this

606
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,679
rig a lot this one is my favorite though

607
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,759
all right so we've talked about the rig

608
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,519
the nail or the banger there are other

609
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,158
options there are a lot of other options

610
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,000
for nails you could get a terp slurper

611
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
which then you're going to need a gasket

612
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
and a marble and some other stuff for

613
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,720
that

614
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,480
there are other options that look

615
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,798
different but they do the same thing you

616
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,798
guys this is my preference this just

617
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,119
happens to be my preference i like these

618
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,798
uh round bottom bangers uh with the carb

619
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,319
cap on it that's just what i prefer it

620
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,319
just hits real nice like i said i like

621
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,639
the flared mouthpiece that's just it's

622
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,399
all about preference find what you like

623
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
now talking about finding what you like

624
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
let's talk a little bit about dab

625
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,558
temperature i said that i like to take

626
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
my dabs a little bit too hot some people

627
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,720
prefer them a little bit cooler if you

628
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,919
don't have a dab right thermometer or an

629
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,519
email dialing in your dab temperature

630
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,200
can take a couple of dabs you may have

631
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,279
to waste a couple of dabs to figure it

632
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
out so my advice would be to just scoop

633
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,359
up a dab then get your torch we didn't

634
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,279
go over the torch i'm using it's

635
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,199
basically a creme brulee torch from

636
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,399
amazon i like this one because it spits

637
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
out two flames i don't know if the

638
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
camera will catch this but uh there are

639
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
two flames coming out of there they kind

640
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,599
of blend into one in the camera it does

641
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,839
have two little flames which really

642
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,719
heats up the stuff really quickly so my

643
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,720
banger gets real hot real quick but

644
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
i would scoop up my dab i would heat up

645
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,558
my banger when i heat up the banger i

646
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,720
heat it from the bottom corner this is a

647
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,960
round bottom banger if it were a square

648
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,519
bottom i would heat it where the floor

649
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,880
and the wall meet that is kind of the

650
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,400
the rule of thumb that i follow where

651
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,919
the floor and the wall meet and i'll

652
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,440
kind of work my way around it just a

653
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,600
little bit but i heat right about here

654
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,038
because i know uh just from dabbing a

655
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,959
lot i know that when i put my dab in

656
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,400
there that's where i'm gonna hit

657
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,759
right there on that corner and then

658
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,840
since i hold it kind of tipped it all

659
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,200
tips to that direction anyway when i put

660
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,480
the cap on it's going to start spinning

661
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,319
it around so i heat it i heat it until

662
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,679
um it almost starts glowing if it's

663
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,599
dirty i'll clean it with the torch

664
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,759
that's ridiculous i'll heat it until i

665
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,959
see that it's hot then i let it cool

666
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,200
down

667
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
now i let it cool until i use my hand

668
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,679
it's not hot right now i keep touching

669
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
it's like a loaded gun i have to keep

670
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,320
checking it or a maybe loaded gun i

671
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,558
check it with my finger my hand the palm

672
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,879
of my hand and i can tell by the palm of

673
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,240
my hand when the dab is ready i wanted

674
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,960
to feel like

675
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,960
if i pushed the banger into my skin

676
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,038
it wouldn't burn

677
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
the [ __ ] out of me but it wouldn't be

678
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,319
pleasant at all it'd be like oh i burned

679
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,600
the [ __ ] out of myself but then it'd be

680
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,279
red for a minute you might get a little

681
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,240
blister but it's not going to make a

682
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,759
[ __ ] big problem if it goes and [ __ ]

683
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,279
your skin up that's way too hot don't

684
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,599
try it don't that's not a good way to

685
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,200
test it but if it's sizzling up your

686
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,759
skin that's too hot i want it to feel

687
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,519
kind of like a painful pinch but not a

688
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,519
scary burn when i get close when i'm

689
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,960
just right about here it's like feeling

690
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,639
the baby bottle like you just got to get

691
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,319
it close and see what it feels like so

692
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,960
once i feel like it's close then i just

693
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,319
go sometimes i'll give it a pull

694
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,840
and i can tell the temperature of this

695
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,839
nail by pulling through this water if

696
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,079
it's still super hot don't do it it's

697
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,879
still super hot so heat it up let it

698
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,678
cool give it a feel then put the dab in

699
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,240
there and be i i'm already inhaling as

700
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
the dab goes in it's kind of like it

701
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,200
just happens kind of simultaneously i've

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,759
got to dab on the dabber i'll use the

703
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,000
other end but i go

704
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,000
just happens like that so i'm inhaling i

705
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,278
put the dab on there it starts smoking

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,839
up a little bit if your dab goes

707
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,599
and sizzles right away she was way too

708
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,240
hot way too hot your lungs are gonna

709
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,480
sizzle abort mission quit inhaling

710
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,558
if it bubbles up real nice

711
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
oh yeah next step sorry i forgot a step

712
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,399
put your dab in there set the dabber

713
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,240
down then grab your trusty carb cap and

714
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,159
put that carb cap on top and watch that

715
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,000
[ __ ] in there if it bubbles up and just

716
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,440
boils really smooth you might have a

717
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,119
pretty close temperature give it a good

718
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,960
pull

719
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,639
see what happens are you getting smoke

720
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,759
is the smoke real thick is the smoke

721
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,440
real thin

722
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,440
if you're not getting any smoke if the

723
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,038
dab didn't melt guess what not hot

724
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,759
enough if that [ __ ] sizzled up right

725
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,519
away way too hot just take a few more

726
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,679
dabs and kind of feel remember where you

727
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,918
were like this is way too hot this is

728
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,880
way too cool and then find your middle

729
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,038
ground

730
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
if you do take a dab and you've got some

731
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,038
concentrates puddled down here in the in

732
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,519
the bottom of your banger put the carb

733
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,038
cap on it hit it with the torch for two

734
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,839
and a half to three seconds i know

735
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,839
that's not much time but

736
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
that's enough to get a reheat we call

737
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,839
that a reheat

738
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,480
so you got your carb cap on here and

739
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,158
then you're just going to hit it with

740
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,079
set the torch down grab the cap and then

741
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,480
hit it again i bet you'll get smoked

742
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,918
that time that's a reheat so if that

743
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,200
worked that means that the first time it

744
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
was not hot enough i don't have

745
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
super

746
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,640
like super accurate dial it in advice to

747
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,278
get the temperature that you want i

748
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
prefer a hotter dab than most people for

749
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,119
a while there was a trend of you gotta

750
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,519
waste it to taste it where people were

751
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,439
uh burning it so low temperature that it

752
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,200
would taste super good but you'd have to

753
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
get two q-tips and clean up the [ __ ]

754
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
banger because they would leave so much

755
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,240
junk behind i don't leave [ __ ] behind

756
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
when i take a dab i take mine a little

757
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,319
bit hotter than that but also sometimes

758
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,839
i roast myself and i gotta catch my

759
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,960
breath and sit down for a minute but i

760
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,000
kind of enjoy that so maybe i'm a sicko

761
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,919
my advice like i said heat it up feel it

762
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,839
with your hand feel it feel it is it too

763
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
hot is it not hot enough

764
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,678
take a dab maybe waste a few dabs what

765
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
are you gonna do hang out with your girl

766
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,200
get a gram or two of concentrates and

767
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
just take a couple of dabs and dial it

768
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,278
in you'll get one dab that will make you

769
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,960
so high that you'll be satisfied uh take

770
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,200
a few mental notes like it was way too

771
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,798
hot it's not hot enough learn what you

772
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,798
like you may like it a lot hotter than

773
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,480
your bro your bro may like it a lot

774
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,400
hotter than you you never know what

775
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,079
people may like so dial in that

776
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
temperature the way that is perfect for

777
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,240
you another thing that you may want to

778
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,480
do is get yourself an email what's an

779
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,319
email now we've got devices that plug

780
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
into the wall it's got a little wire

781
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,480
that comes off of a box that hooks up to

782
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,000
your banger or your nail or whatever

783
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
device it may come with depending on

784
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,319
what company you shop with on that box

785
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
it's got a number which you set it to

786
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,119
and that number will control the heat at

787
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,559
the end of the nail then you can get a

788
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,000
consistently heated nail every time you

789
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,240
want to dab and it's always on if this

790
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,440
were had an email cable on it and i

791
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,720
wanted to hit it i could just grab it

792
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,558
right now take a dab there would be no

793
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,640
need to heat it up no need to torch it

794
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,240
it would already be ready already so

795
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
that's an email that's a great device

796
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
you could definitely dial that in get

797
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,399
that completely perfect one thing i'm

798
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,278
going to say about the email

799
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,840
most of those devices the number on that

800
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,400
device does not correlate with the

801
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,119
number on the surface of the nail

802
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,519
in temperature it is just a number on

803
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,759
the box it is probably it's like a

804
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,200
volume setting on your car it's got one

805
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,798
through whatever i'm gonna go with one

806
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
through ten maybe your spinal tap and

807
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,639
you've got eleven but we got one through

808
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,320
ten right i know that if i turn my car

809
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
stereo up to ten it sounds like total

810
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,519
[ __ ] i'm over doing it the speakers

811
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,599
can't handle it the gear is not meant to

812
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,200
do that i know if i hover around seven

813
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,199
it [ __ ] rocks it's as loud as i want

814
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,960
to go i know if i get down to six that's

815
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,880
cool for traffic when the cops come i go

816
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,319
down to like number three if i'm trying

817
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
to find an address i turn it down to

818
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,359
number two why do i need it down so low

819
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,360
to find an address it's just weird [ __ ]

820
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,278
that we do but what i'm getting at is

821
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,519
that number on the 1 through 10 on my

822
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,919
car stereo doesn't mean that it's coming

823
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,519
out at level 10 on the speakers it

824
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,520
doesn't know it's just 1 through 10.

825
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,240
those are just arbitrary settings it's

826
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,319
not one decibel or 10 decibels it's just

827
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,079
1 through 10. basically one through a

828
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,319
hundred percent so what i'm getting at

829
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,639
is on that box that's not a a

830
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,398
temperature on the nail that doesn't

831
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
correlate as a temperature that's just a

832
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,719
setting it's high medium low

833
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,880
but find the number that works for you

834
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
and set it at that number but don't

835
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,559
think that that number is the exact

836
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,038
temperature that your nail is at because

837
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,798
i don't think that that works that way

838
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,558
if you want to find out get yourself a

839
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,240
dab right and then put the dab right

840
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,158
under there turn on the email and see

841
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,440
what the dabrite measures that may be a

842
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,880
good thing if you're new to dabbing and

843
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,519
you want to spend some money at dabrite

844
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,960
is a great device i do not have one i've

845
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,558
thought about getting one if dabrite

846
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,480
would like to advertise on the podcast

847
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,240
what's up guys i'll trade you a dab

848
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,679
right for a couple of ads here we'll use

849
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,599
it on the show it may work out i'll do

850
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,360
it on instagram live anyway enough

851
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,240
pitching myself also your ad could be

852
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,079
here if you'd like to do some

853
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,919
advertising on the show reach out i'm

854
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,759
[ __ ] high and rambling get an email

855
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
you guys check that out dial that in but

856
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,879
don't think that the number on the email

857
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,640
is actually a temperature i think it's

858
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,480
actually a frequency like megahertz or

859
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,360
something that's probably more likely

860
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,319
what that is um for on the road dabs i

861
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,240
like the puffco a lot of times allegedly

862
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,558
possibly you may see me hitting this rig

863
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,480
in the car if not i may be hitting a

864
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,639
puffco a puffco pro puffco peak

865
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,159
whichever the newest one is

866
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
it's growing on me at first i didn't

867
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,159
like them they take a lot of maintenance

868
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,360
and care but they are growing on me

869
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
another thing i should talk about is a

870
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,678
nectar collector nectar collectors are

871
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,600

taking dabs or q-tips i mentioned q-tips

887
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,119
earlier after i take a dab there's going

888
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
to be a little bit of stuff left in here

889
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,879
possibly maybe i do grab a q-tip and i

890
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,240
just give it a couple of good swirls

891

and take a dab there are other great

895
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,038
accessories you could think about i

896
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,880
talked about the tert pearls that i've

897
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,720
got in here they do sell a little

898
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,120
grabber so you could pull the pearls out

899
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,079
and clean those i like to use a product

900
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,319
called dark crystal glass cleaner dark

901
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:23,119
crystal is from canada it's a great

902
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,480
product i use it quite often on a lot of

903
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,398
my products i probably cleaned all the

904
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,000
[ __ ] on the table with it recently it's

905
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,759
a good product my shit's dirty now so

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
don't judge my stuff by don't judge the

907
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,000
product by that i've been using it but a

908
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,759
dark crystal is a great glass cleaner i

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,880
recommend that

910
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,440
you've got 10 14 and 18 millimeter

911
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,240
bangers i really like a rig with water

912
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,159
in it um i think i've covered all of the

913
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,240
notes so one of my favorite things about

914
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,320
dabs is most of the flower that you buy

915
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,720
that you can buy that is available in a

916
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,798
colorado dispensary is going to come in

917
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,480
somewhere between 19 and 30 thc a

918
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,158
if we look at the back of this container

919
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,839
of concentrates this product contains

920
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,399
74.9

921
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,079
thca

922
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,798
one big fat dab of this is like

923
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,199
basically smoking two or three regular

924
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,038
sized joints to the face by yourself and

925
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,038
i get to get all that potency into my

926
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,519
bloodstream into my lungs into my face

927
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:22,000
into my brain just that quick one quick

928
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,599
fat dab maybe a fat cough and then after

929
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,359
that i can move on with my business i

930
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,199
don't have to sit here and roll up three

931
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,798
or four joints and smoke three or four

932
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,360
joints and cough a bunch of times and

933
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,200
smell like herb and i could just smoke a

934
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,158
big fat dab don't get me wrong i do love

935
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
smoking flowers but sometimes that dab

936
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,278
is what i need speaking of dabs i'm

937
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,278

cool beverage i've already got part of a

939

all right podcast world i do apologize i

945
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,919

dab and wrap up the show it does occur

950
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,798
to me that maybe i should start doing

the wrap up before i hit a dab so that

952
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,398
