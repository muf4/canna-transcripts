00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,080
I like to start the episode off by

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,939
letting you know what I'm smoking on

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,219
I've got a fresh new pick up of some

39
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,368
concentrates I grabbed some lemon

40
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,739
Versace nectar which is a mix of lemon

41
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,299
oh gee and skittles when I brought this

42
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,679
home and took a dab of it I hadn't read

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,329
the package yet to see what the flavor

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,618
description was I was just excited I was

45
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:34,109
like a lemon Versace I want to dab it

46
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,159
that psycho home it took a fat dab in

47
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,799
the lemon Versace

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,960
it tasted like I described it as a burnt

49
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,659
marshmallow with lemon juice on top of

50
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,489
it it was pleasant and I enjoyed it but

51
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,509
it was very unique so then I grabbed the

52
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,879
package and I looked at what it's

53
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,118
described as and it says unique lemon

54
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,099
profile sweet sour candied and burnt so

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,319
I definitely picked up on the unique

56
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,089
lemon profile and I got the burnt the

57
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,919
sweet sour and candied I didn't really

58
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,750
notice much of but that burnt

59
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,060
marshmallow flavor was kind of pleasant

60
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,129
I've never had that and a dab before so

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,368
that was nice the thing about the lemon

62
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,959
Versace it didn't do much for me high

63
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,669
wise it didn't get me high it did not

64
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,219
medicate me it didn't really do a whole

65
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,229
lot i had taste amazing it taste

66
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,000
really good but it doesn't do much for

67
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:19,289
what I'm trying to do I'm trying to get

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,229
high I'm not just trying to taste it I

69
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,750
also picked up some infinity Oh G nectar

70
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,169
which is a combination of underdog og

71
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,509
and i-95 this is described as a gas and

72
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,059
earth I popped this open it took a fat

73
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,370
dab of this and it was tremendous

74
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,530
earthy gas all over my tongue all in my

75
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,890
face the high was incredible the

76
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,289
infinity og nectar was really nice so

77
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,599
what I decided to do you know me I took

78
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,189
a good sized a dab of the infinity og

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,979
nectar and then I dunked that right

80
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,349
inside of the lemon Versace nectar and I

81
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:56,009
took a dab of that combo and that is

82
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,349
like a lemon gas punch to the face and

83
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,359
it gave me a super nice flavor it had a

84
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,729
tremendous face high too and it went

85
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,860
right to my face right to my head that

86
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,049
was an amazing combo so the infinity og

87
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,780
put the punch in there and put that gas

88
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,209
in there and then that lemon Versace put

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,680
that lemon Skittles candy Terp it kind

90
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,050
of washed out that burnt marshmallow and

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,490
brought out more of the candy flavor it

92
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,719
was a really good idea I thought to mix

93
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,430
them so that's what I'm dabbing on you

94
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,219
guys the infinity og nectar and the

95
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,200
lemon Versace nectar combination from

96
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,939
Green Dot labs obviously it's got me

97
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,549
nice and rambly which is good because

98
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,789
this is going to be a long podcast I've

99
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,620
got a great topic to get into but first

100
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:36,569
let's talk a little bit about what I did

101
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,769
Thursday evening well you guys were

102
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,719
hanging out listening to the new episode

103
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,390
of the show I was in Denver

104
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,250
seeing wheeler Walker jr. at the Gothic

105
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,139
theater now if you know who wheeler

106
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,299
Walker jr. is you're probably going what

107
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,339
Rasta Jeff went to a country concert and

108
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,560
if you don't know who wheeler Walker jr.

109
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,390
is let me explain to you that Rasta Jeff

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,280
went to a country concert I've never

111
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,109
referred to myself in third person like

112
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,430
that that was awkward

113
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,040
anyway yes I went to my very first

114
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,409
country concert I saw wheeler Walker jr.

115
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,349
and two other acts at the Gothic theatre

116
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,090
in Denver Colorado ah I went to see

117
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,849
wheeler because I think wheeler Walker

118
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,909
is hilarious he comes out dressed in

119
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,409
full cowboy [ __ ] rebel cowboy outfit

120
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,238
he's got his boots and his tight jeans

121
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,890
and his [ __ ] belt buckle that you

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,689
could use as a dinner plate then he's

123
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,279
got a long-sleeved flannel shirt tucked

124
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,199
in and he's got it buttoned up all the

125
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,329
way to the top and then he's got the

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,599
cowboy beard that's well-kept you know

127
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,099
to me

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
it's just long enough to say I'm a rebel

129
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,220
[ __ ] but then it's kept nice and

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,030
tight also he's got that big bushy

131
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,100
mustache

132
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,809
he's got them cop glasses looking at you

133
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,000
and he's got his big wheeler Walker

134
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,129
junior cowboy hat on and he comes out

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,050
and they started playing this if you're

136
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,430
I'm not into country music necessarily

137
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,710
but I don't hate country music I'm a

138
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,240
musician I've been I've been hired to

139
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,250
play in country bands before and you

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,410
learn to appreciate it and it's not bad

141
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,730
especially the [ __ ] wheeler does it's

142
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,550
kind of it's the fun kind of country

143
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,020
it's that rowdy [ __ ] I guess it's

144
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,270
called rebel countries what they call it

145
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,379
I'm not a country fan but I think so he

146
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:03,959
comes and he does this like rock and

147
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,300
roll country [ __ ] right then he starts

148
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,469
singing lyrics that are just ridiculous

149
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,550
and we'll get into that here in a minute

150
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,200
let's talk more about the show and then

151
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,569
then we'll top this off with some of the

152
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,639
song titles and some of the lyrics so I

153
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,819
Drive up to Denver I park as I'm walking

154
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,589
in I realize I am the only dreadlocked

155
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,079
guy in the building I'm the only one

156
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,299
there that is not a country music fan

157
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,449
and so far I'm the only one I've seen

158
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:31,050
that is there for the joke that is

159
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,399
wheeler Walker jr. and I'm kind of

160
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,889
feeling a little bit out of place the

161
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,419
first band was straight-up country they

162
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,599
were [ __ ] good you guys they were

163
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,850
really good they were so soulful the had

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,220
a singer that played acoustic guitar had

165
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,720
a full band bass drums lead guitar but

166
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,660
the senior played acoustic guitar and

167
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,190
they had a female singer that sang with

168
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,590
him that I'm going to assume they were

169
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,089
related they had to be brother or sister

170
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:55,349
somewhere along the line they've been

171
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,719
singing together for years cuz they

172
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,910
sounded rich like the sound that came

173
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,050
out of them was real they sounded really

174
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,340
good so I don't know the name of the

175
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,020
opening act I apologize for that I

176
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,310
didn't pay any attention to that I was

177
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,459
just trying to get comfortable in the

178
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,649
environment I've never been in that

179
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,870
environment it was a lot of country

180
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,029
fancy guys it was folks in tight jeans

181
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,470
and flannel shirts and [ __ ] beards

182
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,789
and a wad of chew and a hat in their

183
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,130
face and that's not my environment I

184
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,629
don't know how they're gonna take me

185
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,129
encroaching on their show so I'm just

186
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,110
trying to walk around and like you know

187
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,329
get a feel am I welcome and I was I was

188
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,639
so it was kind of silly on my part to

189
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,409
feel that these country fans may not

190
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,329
want me there they didn't give a [ __ ] I

191
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,540
got a few looks well I've got dreadlocks

192
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,039
to my ass I get looks but nobody gave a

193
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,900
[ __ ] that I was a weirdo at the country

194
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,220
show so that was cool then the second

195
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,469
act came on and

196
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,760
spent the first since I just snuck in

197
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,020
during the first ban I don't like to go

198
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,360
walk right in front of people while the

199
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,859
band is playing so I just went toward

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,540
the back of the club and got a big view

201
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,069
of the whole Club and then as the first

202
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,960
band picked up their gear

203
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:58,319
I walked closer to the stage and got a

204
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,389
little up closer and then the second

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,159
opener came out and he was not very

206
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,509
entertaining the crowd was talking over

207
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,250
and then kind of they were they were

208
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,129
bored with him and he could feel the

209
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,439
vibe but then someone lit a joint in the

210
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,480
crowd or some weed somewhere and the

211
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,889
country crowd got really weird about it

212
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,569
and the funny part is it was bad

213
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,000
smelling weed it smell like a shitty

214
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,170
Roach or it just didn't smell like good

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,790
weed and someone lit weed in that

216
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,199
country crowd kind of got uptight you

217
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,610
can see there kind of some of them are

218
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,560
like someone's smoking weed and some of

219
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,300
them like Oh someone's smoking weed but

220
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,589
it was kind of a it was way different

221
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,629
than the shows I'm used to when someone

222
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,250
smokes weed nobody even notices because

223
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,050
we're all smoking weed but it was just

224
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,790
really funny to smell somebody light

225
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,319
some schwag weed and then watch the

226
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,700
whole crowd kind of look around a couple

227
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,949
of them looked right at me like no I

228
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,750
could see both his hands I knew better I

229
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,339
was gonna [ __ ] smoke weed in there be

230
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,899
the only one in there and they run you

231
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,929
through a pretty rigorous security thing

232
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,039
on the way in but it turns out that

233
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,569
second opener that came out it was one

234
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,950
guy he came out and played a couple of

235
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,689
songs by himself he ended up actually

236
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,610
being wheelers bass player so when

237
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,350
wheeler came out that was the bass

238
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,280
player for wheeler Walker juniors band

239
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,020
anyhow so the first opener was cool the

240
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,459
second opener was awkward it was just

241
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,199
one dude singing songs playing the

242
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,699
guitar he played bass and sang a couple

243
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,149
of times which that's not really a

244
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,459
popular thing to play bass and sing

245
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,469
someone like weed then a couple as the

246
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,228
night went on and things got later more

247
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,970
non country fans came more people that

248
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:23,039
look like they discovered wheeler

249
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,360
through Joe Rogan's podcast more people

250
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,210
that look like they discovered wheeler

251
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Walker jr. through Joey Diaz his podcast

252
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,079
or Chrysler's podcast which are all

253
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,060
places where I've listened to wheeler I

254
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,829
first found wheeler through the Joe

255
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,959
Rogan experience podcast and I really

256
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,490
liked his songs I started listening and

257
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,038
I thought it was funny and then he was

258
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,110
on Diaz a show and so I listened there

259
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,639
and I just kind of like solidified the

260
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,649
songs were in my head and the dude's

261
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,990
attitude was kind of funny so I had to

262
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,669
listen from there anyway more people

263
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,190
started piling in as the night went on

264
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,490
that were obviously not country fans or

265
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,070
at least they weren't dressed in the

266
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,169
tria tire that some of the earlier

267
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,820
arrivals were dressed in nothing against

268
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,229
them it's just obvious country attire

269
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,879
and I'm guess I'm ordering hippie or

270
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,649
look at tire whatever you want to call

271
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,278
it you could you could spot the

272
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,169
differences in the folks so a couple of

273
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,429
younger cats stood in front of me and

274
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,899
I'm wearing a girl from your heart

275
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,159
podcast t-shirt and one of the younger

276
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,589
bros turns to me and he says whose

277
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,969
podcast is that I was like oh that's my

278
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,370
show bro it's all about weed and we

279
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,959
start talking for a few and they're like

280
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,220
what other shows do you listen to and I

281
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,079
was like ah dude I listen to Doug loves

282
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,278
movies Ellison to Diaz actually they

283
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,110
asked me if I listened to the Church of

284
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,820
what's happening now and my answer was

285
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,899
probably [ __ ] yeah [ __ ]

286
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,070
because if you listen to the Church of

287
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,570
what's happening now that's your answer

288
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,570
if somebody asks you if you listen to it

289
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,850
you say [ __ ] ya [ __ ] so that

290
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,528
started conversation two young dudes

291
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,670
named Doug and Daniel they were a good

292
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:44,409
time to hang out with I went to the show

293
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,699
by myself so it was cool to have two

294
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,769
dude show up right in front of me that

295
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,120
were fans of all the other stuff I

296
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,649
listen to they were fans of wheeler

297
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,839
because of the funniness not because

298
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:55,899
it's the new kind of country music and

299
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,610
they also are exposed to the podcast now

300
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,700
so shot it to Doug and Daniel I hope you

301
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,079
guys are listening to the show so our

302
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,820
conversation gets interrupted because

303
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,289
[ __ ] wheeler Walker wants to come out

304
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,670
and do a concert right so the lights go

305
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,588
down a wheeler comes out and he starts

306
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:11,889
playing honestly what might be my

307
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:13,750
favorite wheeler Walker song it's called

308
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,828
songs actually called sit on my face

309
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,509
we're gonna get into that in a little

310
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,979
bit here and I posted a couple of really

311
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,289
cool videos to YouTube I hope you guys

312
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,329
enjoy that so wheeler comes out he plays

313
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:23,740
his first song at the end of the first

314
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,969
song he's like why are you flipping me

315
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,169
off and some girl in the crowd has been

316
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,910
flipping him off for the whole first

317
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:29,078
song so he kicked her the [ __ ] out which

318
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:30,850
kind of made it awkward but then he went

319
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,370
right back into the show which was kind

320
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,659
of cool he played a bunch of great songs

321
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,889
- guys I've got a list of the songs on

322
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,809
my phone I'm gonna pull it up here but

323
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,000
he played a brand-new weed song he's

324
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:42,039
like hey since I'm in Colorado I figured

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,929
I would debut my new weed song and I was

326
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,838
smart enough to pull out my phone I got

327
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:50,289
a pretty sweet recording of that so

328
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,520
that's up on the YouTube channel then he

329
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,469
played more songs they were listed on my

330
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,528
phone I'm gonna read some of those

331
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,500
titles let's do that now let's see some

332
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:01,720
of the songs he played her aha finger in

333
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,360
my butt he played a song called eatin

334
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,940
[ __ ] and kickin ass and the Encore

335
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,899
was [ __ ] king and then the other one of

336
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,570
the encores

337
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,699
I'm not even gonna say the [ __ ] name

338
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,410
of the song because it's kind of

339
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,930
offensive I don't even want to say that

340
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,370
on my show so you could tell he comes

341
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,469
out and he plays his country music right

342
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,149
the whole band is dressed country it

343
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,190
looks like you're at a [ __ ] serious

344
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,559
country show and this dude starts

345
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,210
singing and he starts singing about like

346
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,269
I said the first song is called sit on

347
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,730
my face this song is straight-up about

348
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,019
sitting on my face and it's really

349
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,460
hilarious the way it does it because

350
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,100
it's it sounds like you're gonna hear

351
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,350
some of those 20 [ __ ] truck broke

352
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,269
down dog ran away girlfriend left me

353
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,700
kind of [ __ ] rebel rock and country

354
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,699
things coming out but it's not it's it's

355
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,320
really hilarious so one of the things

356
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,940
that I really laughed at he does a song

357
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,700
and he at the start of the song he goes

358
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,750
this one is for your whole family and I

359
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,480
knew it was gonna be it's a song called

360
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,789
family tree and it is a filthy song

361
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,350
about [ __ ] his way up your family

362
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,779
tree and that's literally what it's

363
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,970
about and one of the lines is if I had

364
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,500
my druthers I'd but [ __ ] both your

365
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,970
brothers yes that's what this man wrote

366
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
for his country song I didn't write

367
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,930
these lyrics I only laughed to them and

368
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,909
reported them to you but he says if I

369
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,129
had my druthers I'd but [ __ ] both your

370
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,559
brothers then I'd find your sister and

371
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,899
take her out back and fist her and the

372
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,639
funniest [ __ ] part of the evening was

373
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:27,069
when this theater filled with people

374
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,189
dressed in country folk attire they

375
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,990
looked like great hard-working people

376
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,490
including they're really cute those

377
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,379

379
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,559

380
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,509
sweet accent they just smile at you

381

384
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:50,439

385
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,850
of animated motion of a fisting motion

386
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,800
there were a couple of uppercuts there

387
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,149

388
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,269

390
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:03,039

the night it was quite a diverse crowd

409

it wasn't all country fan folks there

410
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:43,208
were a lot of people that I would assume

00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,250
found wheeler through the podcasts like

412
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,869

416
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,509

417
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,828

418
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:59,169

421
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,310

422
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,810

425
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,849
was really funny so it was a really

426
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,589
affordable show I couldn't believe how

427
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,269
cheap it was I definitely got my money's

428
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,500
worth they cost me more in gas than it

429
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,480
costs to get in the show so that was a

430
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,129
good time I know a lot of people are

431

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,149
country music it's it's just a thing in

433
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,289
your head that has a label and you

434
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,179
decide you don't like it because it's

435
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:29,980
got that label on it if you can if you

436
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,599
can appreciate the [ __ ] rhythm and

437
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,100
then you can go listen to the words that

438
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,930
are happening on top of it and put the

439
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,730

443
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,349

445
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,730

446

thanks for being patient with me while I

461
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,139
got my life together momentarily while I

462
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:36,220
was gone I took some dabs of this custom

463
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:38,799
oh geez nectar it is a blend of skittles

464
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,170
and half go and Larry oh gee the flavor

465
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,878
is described as assorted hard candies I

466
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:45,399
didn't really get the assorted hard

467
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,379
candies at the label describes it's more

468
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,299
of a it's kind of a fruity sort of a

469
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,730
thing which I guess could could

470
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,708
translate to fruity candy but it's more

471
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,839
of a fruit kind of a floral nectary kind

472
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:58,119
of a thing I'm enjoying it I this is a

473
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,250
good high kind of mellowed me out not as

474
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,379
super high speed as I was before so that

475
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,720
should be good for this portion of the

476
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,550
podcast before we took a break I tease

477
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,170
that we were going to talk about genetic

478
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,838
drift and I said we were going to change

479
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:13,599
your mind about genetic drift let's get

480
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,699
right into it I've got a lot of notes on

481
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,100
the iPad for this one so let's start

482
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:20,229
with what is genetic drift or what do we

483
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,629
think genetic drift means some growers

484
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,909
believe that cloning plant over multiple

485
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:28,449
generations will lead to a loss of plant

486
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:30,578
vigor health or potency so imagine if

487
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:32,109
you've got a plant and you want to grow

488
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,028
it again right so you can take a clone

489
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,800
off of it then you flower that plant out

490
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:37,179
now you've got a clone that plant grows

491
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,528
up you take clones off of that you

492
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,088
flower that out now you've got clones

493
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:43,448
and preservation you just keep repeating

494
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:45,279
that process some folks believe that

495
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:47,169
over time that will lead to problems

496
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,208
which is known as genetic drift now

497
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,429
cannabis is an annual plant meaning it

498
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,018
would only live for one year or one

499
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,899
season naturally our natural growing

500
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,240
season outdoors is dictated by the Sun

501
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,129
the natural cannabis plant life cycle is

502
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,629
usually about six to eight months long

503
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,550
without any human interaction

504
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:06,099
depending on where those plants are

505
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:07,750
located from the from the equator in

506
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,519
relation to the equator they may be

507
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,009
shorter or longer just based on where

508
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,408
they are so to keep our select the

509
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,179
genetic library available we keep mother

510
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,730
plants some other plants are clones of

511
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,649
select cultivars that are kept in a

512
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,659
perpetual vegetative state by keeping

513
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:24,219
that slight cycle on for eighteen or

514
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:26,380
more hours per day

515
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,779
now those mother plants act as preserve

516
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,060
for our genetic stable and also to

517
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:32,680
provide clones for production whether

518
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,569
it's for flowering them out for

519
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,590
production or for breeding whatever

520
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,960
you're doing that's where the clones

521
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,669
will come from for the future now we're

522
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,130
able to grow out a large mother plant

523
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,779
and we can take 50 to 100 maybe even

524
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,640
more clones from a single mother plant

525
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:47,740
and run those for production now that

526
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,390
ensures that all of my plants in that

527
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,880
production run are the same thing

528
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,460
they're all tried true tested reliable

529
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,170
potent female plants that I've ran

530
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,000
before I know that they've got

531
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,070
resistance to pests they've got

532
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,019
resistance to pathogens and I know how

533
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:03,819
long it takes them to flower I know what

534
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,859
to look for I know when certain things

535
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,990
are gonna happen in the growth phase so

536
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,839
I'm running fifty to a hundred of the

537
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,329
same thing this makes my garden easy to

538
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,369
manage I've grown this specific cultivar

539
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:17,740
plenty of times so I know what to expect

540
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,059
I've got a relationship with it now so I

541
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,650
know that I've got a hundred of the same

542
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:23,109
thing to work with so there are no

543
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,240
variable so now I can hit my goals and

544
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,649
that makes everybody happy me I'm happy

545
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,839
because I've hit my goals the grow team

546
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,490
is happy because we likely get a bonus

547
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,019
the owners are happy because they're

548
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,519
making more money because the store has

549
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,559
quality product the customers are happy

550
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,000
the patients are happy because they're

551
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,809
buying a quality product and there's

552
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,450
plenty of it

553
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,909
so it makes everybody happy when I hit

554
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,069
my goals as a cultivation manager now

555
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,170
over time these mother plants we work

556
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:48,519
with they get too large and you can't

557
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,230
really just keep cutting them down

558
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,690
smaller because they get misshapen and

559
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,880
they become a difficult mess they do

560
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,410
just have the plant with a super thick

561
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,730
stalk on it this just got two arms

562
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,259
coming off of it it's got a whole bunch

563
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,269
of mini arms coming off different

564
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:05,079
directions they just get messy and hard

565
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:06,400
to deal with so after a while it's time

566
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,259
to replace your mother plant that's a

567
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,480
simple process I replaced my mother

568
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,849
plants every three to six months ish

569
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,680
depending on the state of my garden and

570
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:16,419
depending on which cultivar I am working

571
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,880
with some things that grow super fast

572
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,340
like the redheaded stranger it's got to

573
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,740
get replaced more frequently than

574
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,809
something like probably the chem for the

575
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,630
chem for doesn't grow super fast that

576
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:31,089
redheaded stranger grows super fast the

577
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,770
chem for it doesn't get his root bound

578
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,389
as quickly that redheaded stranger will

579
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,339
grow up into the whites I'll top it a

580
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,549
couple of times it'll Bush out real wide

581
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,138
I'll top it a couple more

582
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:40,849
it'll push out even wider it'll start

583
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:42,498
tipping itself over I want a bigger pot

584
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,638
it's got to go it's either got to go in

585
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:45,200
a bigger pot which I don't really have

586
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:47,089
room for I don't need that big of a

587
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,830
mother plant so then it just gets

588
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,178
reclone doff of I cut a couple of clones

589
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,829
anyway we'll keep talking about that

590
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,889
it's time to replace your mother plants

591
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:57,019
it's a simple process Irie clone all of

592
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:58,699
the large bombs and create fresh new mom

593
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,638
stock so just go to all of my mother

594
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,319
plants and pull off like one row like

595
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:04,998
five or ten however many you think you

596
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,079
need for one row of your clone er just

597
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,970
pull off enough so that you've got

598
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,829
plenty of clones for that keeper pull

599
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,808
them off of there or if you need a large

600
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:13,970
batch like a hundred or whatever extra

601
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:15,259
take those hundred clones I'll kinda

602
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,028
like a hundred if I need a hundred I'll

603
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:19,069
cut a solid hundred plus a twenty extra

604
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:20,509
for backups that way if something goes

605
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:22,368
wrong then I've got some better

606
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:24,319
selection then I'll cut as many clones

607
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:26,118
as I can get off that bigger a mother

608
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,128
plant and then I'll use one of the

609
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:30,199
really good-looking clones as my

610
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:31,998
replacement mother now sometimes I keep

611
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,249
the old mom around until I've got roots

612
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:36,829
on my new clones but my clone skills are

613
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,480
pretty reliable so those those all those

614
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:41,658
clones I cut I'm pretty sure something's

615
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,489
gonna root but if you don't have super

616
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:47,419
good clone skills maybe take a few extra

617
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:49,129
clones in case something happens or the

618
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:50,600
the always the [ __ ] clones in the

619
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:53,118
corners of the trays they're always a

620
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,288
challenge so cut a few extras just so

621
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,689
you know you have a survivor if you're

622
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:59,419
cutting new mothers stock you want that

623
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,759
to survive so cut as many as you can and

624
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:03,320
then maybe consider leaving a little

625
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,269
portion of that plant alive just like

626
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,339
one or two small branches leave yourself

627
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:09,108
one or two more clones to cut in case

628
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,608
you failed and you've still got that

629
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:12,470
mother plant you can still keep that

630
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:14,239
cultivar you've got a little preserve

631
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,089
over there that it totally looks like

632
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:19,399
[ __ ] but it's there it exists so that's

633
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,868
basically my process of keeping and

634
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:23,118
replacing a mother plant it's fairly

635
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:24,678
similar when I'm doing it in a small

636
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:26,329
home grow if I'm doing it in a private

637
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,489
grow if I'm doing it in a breeder grow

638
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:30,408
it's fairly similar if I'm doing it in a

639
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:32,149
commercial grow when I say a hundred a

640
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:33,440
hundred and twenty plants consider that

641
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:35,209
the commercial grow all the time the

642
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,710
home grow it's very small numbers

643
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,629
nowadays they've limited us so

644
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,038
ridiculously in Colorado that's taking

645
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:42,319
like three clones at a time just to make

646
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,089
sure I've got a copy of that plan so

647
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,740
when I say 120 that's the commercial

648
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,928
grow kind of scale don't get confused

649
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,579
when I say smaller numbers that's the

650
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,450
home girl but it's all a similar process

651
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,919
when you're keeping

652
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,140
they're plants you've got a plant you

653
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,750
need to keep it in veg perpetually then

654
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,820
eventually you need to replace it so now

655
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,799
when we're replacing these plants we're

656
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,029
cutting clones from it and then we're

657
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,710
gonna take back clone and we're gonna

658
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,940
grow it up big again and then we're

659
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,740
gonna cut clones from it like I said

660
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,059
earlier if that one's gonna grow then

661
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,480
it's gonna we're just gonna keep cutting

662
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,129
clones off of clones off of clones that

663
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,000
starts to lead us into where genetic

664
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,620
drift is suspected to start happening

665
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,539
through several rounds of cloning and

666
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:22,849
vegging and then creating new moms and

667
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,529
then clones and then vegging like I said

668
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:27,589
we give the opportunity for what has

669
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,629
been referred to as genetic drift a lot

670
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:31,459
of growers suspect that these plants get

671
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,470
tired or their that their genetics

672
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,660
change over generations and the

673
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,630
subsequent generations become less

674
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:42,230
vigorous less potent and more prone to

675
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,200
pests and pathogens at acts now I

676
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,329
personally have always been skeptical of

677
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,610
genetic drift and I always blamed it on

678
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,589
poor Plant Health where I blend it on

679
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:53,479
the grower or the person who cut the

680
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:55,609
clone and I feel like most of your

681
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,759
genetic drift issues are probably caused

682
00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:00,169
within the first 24 hours of propagation

683
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,750
it's probably from an experienced clone

684
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,570
techniques poor vapor pressure deficit

685
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:08,690
improper lighting lack of nutrients or

686
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:10,909
the presence of pathogens we're usually

687
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,170
my assumptions on what was causing what

688
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,700
people were calling genetic drift

689
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,980
because we would see it early on when

690
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,960
people were saying that they had it so

691
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:23,450
I've always been skeptical I've had my

692
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,579
flow plant since 2007 or 2008 I'm not

693
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,930
sure exactly when I got that time frame

694
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,970
is kind of fuzzy and of course I got a

695
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,380
traumatic brain injury but I know where

696
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,920
I was when I got it I know who gave it

697
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,370
to me

698
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,890
so I know it was about 2007-2008 ish I'm

699
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:39,139
actually running that same flow plant

700
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,600
for her very last time now there's

701
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,220
nothing wrong with her I'm just i've ran

702
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,169
it for so long it's been crossed with

703
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,000
everything it's been there done that and

704
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,380
like I keep saying that they've changed

705
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,240
the rules in Colorado it's where our

706
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,890
numbers are limited I would like to play

707
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,870
with something new and if I want to do

708
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,740
that I have to retire something old and

709
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:59,509
flow it's time for her to go so I'm

710
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,759
running flow for her last time right now

711
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:04,400
she is just a few days away from being

712
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,619
pollinated by King Solomon to make one

713
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,180
batch of piranha seeds so she's had a

714
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,889
long fun run but I need to move on to

715
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,600
something new anyway I got that flow

716
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,190
clone from my friend in two thousand

717
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,589
seven or eight ish now imagine how many

718
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,840
times I've had to reclone and REE mom

719
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:20,029
this one cultivar over the past ten

720
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,609
years it would be at least twenty times

721
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:24,619
if I've done it every six months so I'm

722
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:25,879
sure it was more I'm sure it was more

723
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:27,379
than that because there were times when

724
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,510
I've moved I've moved different houses

725
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,630
I've moved different facilities I have

726
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:34,759
taken it from the house where I lived to

727
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,680
the new house to the other house then I

728
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,710
took it from the house to the house to a

729
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,450
grow facility to another facility and it

730
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,840
still looks amazing

731
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,390
it still looks the same it performs

732
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,279
exactly as I remember in all of those

733
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,070
conditions it does the same thing since

734
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,200
I got her in 2007 somebody else was

735
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:55,579
growing her in 2007 and gave it to me

736
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,890
and it looks like the way that person

737
00:24:55,579 --> 00:25:00,139
grew it still so again I've been

738
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,930
skeptical of genetic drift and I've

739
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,210
played with a lot of plants but since

740
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,180
I'm writing a podcast I have to come at

741
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,250
it unbiased and open-minded so I didn't

742
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,190
want my opinion to get in the way of the

743
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,079
opportunity to learn and also teach so I

744
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,529
did some Google research to open my mind

745
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:21,710
and I totally rattled my current opinion

746
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:24,649
I found a wonderful article on cannabis

747
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,809
industry institute dot-com by a guy

748
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,810
named Randy Robinson about genetic drift

749
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:33,559
and I wanted to share what I learned

750
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:36,200
this article says the true concept of

751
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,119
genetic drift started in the 1920s this

752
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,519
was several decades after Darwin had

753
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,829
already revolutionized biology with his

754
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,480
theory of evolution but scientists still

755
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,909
didn't know how certain traits were

756
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,640
passed on we had some clues from

757
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,740
Mendel's pea studies excuse me but

758
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,140
Mendelian genetics and Darwinian

759
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,269
evolution hadn't been combined yet in

760
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,040
the 20s biologists recognized that

761
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:00,559
certain genes and traits changed a

762
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,839
population without any adaptive or

763
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,700
environmental pressures so let's that's

764
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,980
where we need to make a note biologists

765
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,340
recognized that certain genes and traits

766
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,680
changed a population without any

767
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:14,689
adaptive or environmental pressures for

768
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,940
example let's say there are two types of

769
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,169
the same bird species on an island

770
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,210
somewhat silver

771
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,980
others and some with gold feathers the

772
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,379
color of their feathers confers no

773
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,269
special survival advantages and the

774
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:30,230
colors don't harm the birds either so

775
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:31,759
these colors are neutral mutations after

776
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,618
studying these birds for several years

777
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,298
we noticed that the ratio of silver

778
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:37,849
feathered Birds to gold feather Birds

779
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:40,548
begins to change there used to be a

780
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:43,730
ratio of one silver to one gold but now

781
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:45,408
it's ten Silver's to one gold nothing

782
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,149
happened on the island that should have

783
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,600
selected one color of bird over the

784
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:50,298
other

785
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,168
it just happened randomly this is what

786
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:55,339
is known as genetic drift today

787
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,549
population geneticists referred to

788
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:00,339
genetic drift as sampling error this is

789
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:01,460
something that happens with real-world

790
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:04,730
populations

791
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,919
no sampling is ever perfect and that's

792
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,749
what we're seeing with genetic drift the

793
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,269
sampling error happens over and over

794
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:13,788
again until it's amplified and becomes

795
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:17,509
the most prevalent or in some cases the

796
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:20,210
only gene now what does genetic drift

797
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:22,009
have to do with cloning probably nothing

798
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,108
because pay attention to this part

799
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:26,378
genetic drift only applies to

800
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:28,308
populations of organisms that produce

801
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,829
sexually so when we're talking about

802
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:33,408
cloning cannabis we're dealing with only

803
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:35,358
one organism of course we may produce

804
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,690
thousands of copies of that individual

805
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:41,618
plant but it's still only one plant so

806
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,239
genetic drift does not apply so you guys

807
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:46,189
all this time we've been saying genetic

808
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,700
drift from cloning that's not even

809
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,548
possible

810
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,249
because genetic drift only applies to

811
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:56,089
populations of organisms that reproduce

812
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:58,399
sexually so we are not doing that we are

813
00:27:56,089 --> 00:28:00,558
cloning there's no sexual reproduction

814
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,329
here so that can't even apply genetic

815
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,009
drift is not even a label that can be

816
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:05,210
applied to this situation so that's

817
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,389
where we're gonna change some things

818
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,069
today and this was not my knowledge this

819
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:11,898
is our friend Randy and this article

820
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:15,138
that wrote this here so let's keep

821
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:17,569
moving forward the question of why all

822
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:20,089
of plants clones aren't 100% the same is

823
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:21,950
not easy to answer mainly because we

824
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:24,199
haven't studied cannabis as much as we'd

825
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,509
like especially in large scale grows

826
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,548
most of the research was performed in

827
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:31,700
labs on lower potency plants and small

828
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:32,059
sample sizes however we have taken a ton

829
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,120
of Rhys

830
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:37,190
on other plants it is possible that

831
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,609
clones are themselves producing new

832
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,220
genes or deleting old genes back in 2011

833
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:46,219
his study from Oxford University showed

834
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,470
that no clone was a perfect copy genetic

835
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,750
analysts showed that when genes

836
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,870
regenerate new tissue they tend to

837
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:58,130
spontaneously create new genes you guys

838
00:28:53,869 --> 00:29:00,709
hear that when genes regenerate new

839
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,540
tissue they tend to spontaneously create

840
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,240
new genes it hasn't been confirmed

841
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:08,420
whether or not cannabis does this but it

842
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,210
is possible now the Oxford study called

843
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,220
the phenomenon regenerative mutation

844
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,140
some genes would be duplicated in the

845
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,509
process while other genes were deleted

846
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,910
from the clone altogether however this

847
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:22,819
study looked at the Thale cress plant

848
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,740
and as similar as regenerative mutation

849
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:28,339
and genetic drift may seem there's still

850
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,930
not the same thing so that thing we've

851
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,849
been calling genetic drift you guys we

852
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,680
have got to change the word I think that

853
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:35,929
is more appropriately known as a

854
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,720
regenerative mutation is what's

855
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,600
happening there so let's move forward

856
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,339
with this article it says another reason

857
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,889
we may see changes in some clones is

858
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,990
stress stress doesn't change the genetic

859
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,430
makeup of a clone but it can change how

860
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,640
its genes are expressed through a

861
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,860
process called epigenetics a relatively

862
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,290
new field of biology over the last few

863
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,689
decades we realized that DNA and genetic

864
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:02,269
expression are not set in stone

865
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,309
the experiences of a parent can change

866
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:06,230
the way their DNA is expressed and they

867
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:09,440
can pass those changes on to their

868
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,450
offspring epigenetics may explain why

869
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,850
people who experience severe trauma such

870
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,009
as war might be get children who are

871
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:18,109
more prone to disease and mental illness

872
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:20,150
the stress changed the way the parents

873
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:21,709
genes were expressed and those changes

874
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,230
were passed on to their children

875
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,970
again the DNA itself didn't change but

876
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,190
little control mechanisms such as

877
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,230
chemicals produced to the body are

878
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,820
produced by the body excuse me changed

879
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,910
whether those genes were turned on/off

880
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:36,799
or set to overdrive what are these

881
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,440
stress culprits and our cannabis plants

882
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,419
sometimes a mother plant just gets old

883
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,600
sometimes her feeding cycle has changed

884
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,650
or she gets sick or injured or both some

885
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,779
growers suspect the head

886
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,640
use of synthetic fertilizers or hormones

887
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,129
may epigenetically alter their mothers

888
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,200
causing the clones to lose some desired

889
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,270
trait when it comes to making clones

890
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,759
remember this the act of cloning is

891
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:00,470
Astra's a stressful act you're damaging

892
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,730
tissue by severing part of the plant

893
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,710
from itself

894
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,509
clones also get transplanted and

895
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,480
transported all over the place which can

896
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:10,190
induce stress once this happens dozens

897
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,200
if not hundreds of times to a series of

898
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,390
clones we may end up with different

899
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
qualities in our clones than we started

900
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,480
with

901
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,059
again that article was from cannabis

902
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,860
industry Institute calm by Randy

903
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:24,589
Robinson I hope you guys learned as much

904
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:26,000
as I did because I thought that article

905
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:29,449
got right to the point it taught me a

906
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,339
lot and I really enjoyed it so we can't

907
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,680
say genetic drift anymore because

908
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:36,429
genetic drift only happens in something

909
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,529
that produces sexually the new word is

910
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,420
regenerative mutation regenerative

911
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,619
mutation you guys dropped that one in

912
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,000
the clone room tomorrow when you're

913
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,409
working and watch the lead grower look

914
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
confused watch I'm looking timid ated

915
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,730
like ah [ __ ] this guy knows more than me

916
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,870
also keep in mind they mentioned the

917
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,730
phrase sampling error

918
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:55,159
that's from people taking shitty clones

919
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,990
or taking clones improperly or improper

920
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,060
care of plants or taking a clone from an

921
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,190
unhealthy mother plant that's a sampling

922
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,349
error and also another cause for what we

923
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,670
used to think was genetic drift now

924
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:07,519
we're gonna call it regenerative

925
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,480
mutation so that's a new conversation in

926
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,889
the grow room have fun with that

927
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,990
tomorrow now what we thought we're

928
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,120
seeing may be happening but we were just

929
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,980
identifying it incorrectly again it's

930
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,959
not genetic drift but a regenerative

931
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,730
mutation I would assume the health of

932
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,220
the donor plant the stress and

933
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,269
experience of cloning the environment

934
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,579
it's all got a lot to do with this

935
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:27,980
process I still suspect most of what we

936
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:30,139
see is grower error or plant reaction to

937
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,750
poor stress or poor environment or a

938
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,220
poor cloning technique or unclean

939
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,960
cloning area it's usually a vapor

940
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,120
pressure deficit issue or pest or

941
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,680
pathogen issue I have not some sort of

942
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,869
shock during the cloning process we

943
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,549
basically we're grabbing a plan weren't

944
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:46,549
amputating the arm and we're trying to

945
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:48,259
make it regrow so we give a lot of

946
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,519
opportunity for problems during cloning

947
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,289
imagine if I cut off your arm in the

948
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,849
cloner O'Brien goes think about wherever

949
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,099
you take clones stand in the middle

950
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,449
there and I'm just gonna grab a giant

951
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:59,119
[ __ ] knife and I'm gonna cut your arm

952
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,950
off now would you feel

953
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,959
clean and safe with an open wound in

954
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,830
that room are you cool with that like

955
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,480
you're gonna be like yeah this is

956
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:07,189
totally sanitary you go ahead and set my

957
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,750
arm on that table like do you think that

958
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,220
table where you set your clothes do you

959
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,200
think that's cool for your freshly

960
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,990
amputated arm like do you think that's

961
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,000
gonna be all right do you and then also

962
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,950
would you want me to cut your arm off

963
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,660
while you're feeling strong and healthy

964
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,910
like let me give you a month to work out

965
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,500
and get [ __ ] software when you cut it

966
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,430
off you still got like some strength to

967
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,349
you maybe we could get it

968
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,490
stapled back on or something and we can

969
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:29,779
get it to regenerate because you're

970
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,190
still young and you're still healthy and

971
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,349
you just got super strong and you've

972
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,179
been eating well or do you want us to

973
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:36,919
wait till you're 90 years old and cut

974
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,300
your arm off and try to superglue and

975
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,190
staple that [ __ ] back on when you're

976
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,720
using most of your energy just to live

977
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,179
because you haven't been eating well and

978
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,799
your body's all frail by now so think

979
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:47,420
about where the clones come from the

980
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,428
best way to prevent regenerative

981
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,019
mutation is to keep healthy mother

982
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,700
plants take your clones from healthy

983
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,759
mother plants have a sterile cloning

984
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,769
area and a solid cloning method right

985
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,990
some SOPs go read some cloning

986
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,639
techniques I'll put out another cloning

987
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,470
podcast a very soon here I've got one

988
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,710
out already I plan on putting out a

989
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,500
revised cloning episode here in just a

990
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,720
few weeks so if you see your mother

991
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,639
plant getting weak cut some clones right

992
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,049
away for safekeeping as soon as you see

993
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,878
you're looking shitty just take a few

994
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,260
clones I'm always pulling clones off the

995
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,668
plants all the time anyway just to have

996
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,919
fresh mother plants just to keep the

997
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,869
cycle going sometimes I know that I'm

998
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,089
gonna want a whole bunch of this plant

999
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,469
so I'll cut like four clones of that and

1000
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,940
I'll veg those out to get them kind of

1001
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,049
big and then I'll take all my clones off

1002
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,329
of those four and they just become

1003
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:35,120
sacrificial plants they die but then

1004
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,500
I've got tons of clones from just get

1005
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,569
good at cloning get good at identifying

1006
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,820
problems and your mother plants and have

1007
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,679
timing and know when that mother plants

1008
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,879
starting to burn out but you also have

1009
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,200
to be able to tell if you've got issues

1010
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:46,849
you have spider mites do you have

1011
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,019
Russert mites you have something eating

1012
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:50,059
at the roots do you have a problem

1013
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,099
making that mother plant get tired so

1014
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,960
figure that out and if it looks like

1015
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:56,329
she's healthy and she's just burning out

1016
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,889
on you clone off of her get some plenty

1017
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,690
of clones and then get those clones

1018
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:02,299
rooted put them under a lot of light

1019
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,909
feed them very well and get those back

1020
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,310
to super health and then clone off of

1021
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:08,929
those for your next run also if you're

1022
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:10,489
doing the clone off your veg plants

1023
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:12,799
clone off your veg plants going off your

1024
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:14,659
veg plants again same thing just make

1025
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,830
sure your veg plants are super healthy

1026
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:19,069
you know what I mean if you're doing it

1027
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:20,299
you grow your veg stock up Alone's off

1028
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,250
of those those become the next

1029
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,660
generation you put everything into flour

1030
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,250
except your little clones the clones

1031
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,929
root those become the next generation

1032
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,880
you take a couple clones off of those

1033
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:30,679
put them into the flour room you guys

1034
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,660
understand how it goes so that's how a

1035
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,849
lot of Perpetual groves work you guys

1036
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:36,289
you're not going to get problems if you

1037
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:38,690
do things correctly if you keep

1038
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:41,840
everybody healthy it'll take a long time

1039
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,030
to cause regenerative mutation problems

1040
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,980
all right you guys that is my report on

1041
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,870
genetic drift now known as regenerative

1042
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,389
mutation I hope you learned as much as I

1043
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,579
did visit the website where I found the

1044
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:55,219
article that is cannabis industry

1045
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:57,110
institute dot-com they have a lot of

1046
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,669
great informative articles this was the

1047
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,650
first time I visited the website but it

[Music]

1092
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,809
so we do that by having a mother plant

1093
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,789
holy [ __ ] a spider just fell out of the

1094
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:56,170
sky at me well that's a little clip

1095
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,550
we're gonna have to [ __ ] save for the

1096
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,180
end of the show or put some water that

1097
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,180
was interesting
