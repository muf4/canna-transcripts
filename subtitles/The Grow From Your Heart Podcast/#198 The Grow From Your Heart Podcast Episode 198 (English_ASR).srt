I really don't know what happened in

97
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:16,699

98
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,649

105
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:32,360

109
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,970

110
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:45,959
recording out there

111
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,550
so yeah the videos that I saw were great

112
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,930

114

the slabs for dabs ketball nice what was

117
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,000
the event that took you guys out there

118
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:10,860
the cannabis code okay that was a true

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,769
everybody we got a rewind on you said

120
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,470
dabs give all basketball people in

121
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,359
Oklahoma their [ __ ] high or going

122
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,690
dabs ketball [ __ ] these Colorado

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,879
people do it yeah so so somebody has now

124
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,800
created a Bangor where there is a

125
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,240
backboard on the Bangor I talked about

126
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,270
Bangor on the last episode of hope you

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,329
guys were there so they have and it's

128
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:36,120
they've marketed as dab sketball so the

129
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:39,209
glass mule is who was out there with the

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,370
the dab sketball nails and everything so

131
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:44,339
I take this Bangor with the backboard

132
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,600
and I heat the Bangor and I throw my dad

133
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,699
at it just like I'm playing basketball

134
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,330
uh-huh and it has a bubble cap for it

135
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,449
and now what if I miss I just keep going

136
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,829
keep shooting where does the dad goes so

137
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,229
the way we played it we played on a big

138
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:03,269
table we played it one verse one and we

139
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:06,270
just lined up like each person got three

140
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,680
dabs and you just heated up the second

141
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,060
they're turning red you give it a 10

142
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,610
second cooldown you start throwing and

143
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,019
the trick is to throw it as fast as you

144
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,850
possibly can to make it the first shot

145
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,629
so the other person has to take a hot

146
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:26,189
and hurry I don't even think that's the

147
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:27,659
trick so you throw a half gram dad's

148
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,069
across the table there are people in

149
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,419
other places right now that want to

150
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,310
punch themselves in the forehead hearing

151
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,599
that [ __ ] they threw a half gram dab

152
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,509
across the table with the chance of

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,460
missing and losing that half grand

154
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,930
wrongdoers literally like 30 kids around

155
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,939
this table in the second like I felt

156
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,939
like where to go where do I got I got

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,699
I never really made it off the table

158
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,800
where can people see some video from the

159
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,599

249
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,980
vaporizer and I like this I like how

250

just giving my quick and I've only

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,820
bested with it once or twice for a

253
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,470
couple of minutes I like how easy to

254
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,640
fill it is I like that you can fill

255
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,350
those little canisters and have them

256
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,610
kind of pre-loaded like shotgun shells I

257
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,440
could just eject one and put the other

258
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,980
one in I liked how easy it was to

259
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,970
operate

260
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,190
I didn't clog up on me every handheld

261
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,480
portable smoking device I've ever used I

262
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,760
[ __ ] ruined within two or three days

263
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,039
because I overheat them or they melt or

264
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,659
I clogged them up this one seems like

265
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,458
they have solved all those problems and

266
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,129
it came with enough tools that if I do

267
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:06,199
[ __ ] it up I'm sure I can fix it

268
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:08,299
she's exhaling or she's gonna talk so

269
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,509

271
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,879

272
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,379
you want to about these vai handheld

273
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,370

274
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,480
gonna tell you what it looks like on my

275
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,370
own and then all the ones you talk about

276
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,930
it she's kind of choking from a DAB also

277
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,279
so I'm gonna give her a second no I like

278
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,069
your descriptions anyway so go for it

279

280
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,920
the size I don't even know what that's

281
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:36,780
comparable to it's the size of like a

282
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:38,009
battery as compared to another vaporizer

283
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,689
but I don't want to say their name it's

284
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,769
very similar to that size but I'd like

285
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,720
it better because I've used that one

286
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,850

little V on it you've told me how to use

303
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,289
it it's super simple it's got a little

304
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,990
spot on the bottom where you can unscrew

305
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:23,579
it and you just load in preload they're

306
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,019
not pre-loaded you load them yourself

307
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,490
but you load in cartridges that you can

308
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,960
preload before you get to wherever

309
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,580
you're going so you don't have to be or

310
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,250

315
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,500

325
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,160
someone came to me and said would you

326
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,110
like to sit on a focus group and I said

327
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:15,870
sure excuse me now I've got myself all

328
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,190
tickled and all choked up dad Chris

329
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,360
that'll help her out that'll help me

330
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,010
yeah um so a year and a half ago they

331
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,620
someone came to me and asked if I want

332
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:28,200
to be on a focus group and I said sure

333
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,139
so they brought a product out that was

334
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,570
looked exactly similar to this but had

335
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,879
different program software into it and

336
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,400
uh they said well what do you think

337
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,470
about this and we sat on a focus group

338
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,360
for three days and we you know we went

339
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,259
back and forth and we gave our opinions

340
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,940
on it and all this kind of stuff so

341
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,669
we've actually gone through and

342
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,590
developed this with it because after we

343
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:55,799
were all done with the vaporizers on day

344
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,899
three Chris and I broke out the rigs and

345
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,079
we started dabbing and you know we

346
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,189
started showing them how important

347
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,639
concentrates are to this cannabis

348
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,380
community and once they saw that well

349
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,460
and I shouldn't say they once Barack the

350
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:17,519
the inventor of this device once brock

351
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:20,940
saw how passionate we were about like

352
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,939
dabs and how important concentrates are

353
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,640
to us he was like oh I need to go back

354
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,870
and completely change this and you know

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,730
redo it so he did he went back and then

356
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,500
he came back again with a whole new

357
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,629
product I mean it's the same like shape

358
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,419
and everything but it is completely like

359
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:41,009
the inside is completely different the

360
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,759
way it cooks and all that kind of stuff

361
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:46,649
so yeah to be honest with you I'm not a

362
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,340
vaporizer person either really you know

363
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:54,569
that but Barack is so passionate about

364
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,550
this and he stands behind this so much

365
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,950
that you almost kind of when you meet

366
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,949
him you almost kind of like can't not

367
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,450
get behind him kinda like yeah okay all

368
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,610
right it's nice and then when you start

369
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,200
to use it you see how you know how great

370
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,269
it is too so

371
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:14,730
Barack's whole vision for this started

372
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:17,309
because he he's actually a vapor I like

373
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,899
has a vaporizing fat bill excuse me has

374
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:24,719
a vaporizer making factory in China and

375
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:26,490
he would he would have these people come

376
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,590
to him with different like designs and

377
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,120
stuff and you know he would sell it to

378
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,860
them for one price and then they would

379
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,120
sell it to distributors and distributors

380
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,399
sell it to vaporizer

381
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,769
excuse me um retailers and then you know

382
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,778
us as the consumers pay four hundred

383
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,730
five hundred percent his super

384
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:44,409
affordable piece that he made got marked

385
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,909
up by just like everything else in this

386
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,409
industry just like any consumable

387
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,850
product to go marked up by every hand

388
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:52,269
that touched it every driver that drove

389
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,930
it okay so he started he had an epiphany

390
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:59,710
and he said what if I bring a great

391
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:03,039
quality vaporizer that anybody can

392
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:06,250
afford and that's his whole mission is

393
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,379
to bring fairness back to vaping that's

394
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,028
you know he just he sees all these other

395
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,980
companies out there that are charging

396
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:14,019
between like a hundred and three hundred

397
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,528
and fifty dollars for a handheld

398
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:19,269
vaporizer when it's just he I mean he

399
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,700
calls it you know for lack of a better

400
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:27,009
word like greed and it's very true you

401
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:30,460
know it's just it's what it is but yeah

402
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,720
so it's very it's a very cool start to

403
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,450
something and it's a really great

404
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,600
movement so the vibe revolution is just

405
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:42,278
that it's bringing fairness back to to

406
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:46,028

456
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:41,929
costs fifty dollars 49 but it's well

457
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,399
worth it does it how many of those

458
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:47,490
cartridges does it come with it comes

459
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,860
with two flower ones and one black swan'

460
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,380
nice and you said that those are

461
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,500
reusable or they're reusable or they're

462
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,840
cheap enough that like if you wanted to

463
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,429
so the way that the capsules work is you

464
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:59,750
can pre pack them before you go out so

465
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,970
if you want to go to concerts and stuff

466
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,710
like that you can just take them and you

467
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,900
can honestly let them hit the ground

468
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,519
because they're the the stainless steel

469
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,059
ones when they come out they're hot to

470
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,730
the touch

471
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:13,069
obviously because it's in an oven but um

472
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,630
you can honestly just let them hit the

473
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:16,099
ground and walk away from them and it

474
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,530
won't even matter because they're gonna

475
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,058
be so cheap to replace that it doesn't

476
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:24,109
even matter just like a spent shell

477
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:25,428
casing exactly see that's funny they one

478
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,719
thing we talked kept calling them

479
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:34,009
bullets and we're like we gotta stop

480
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:35,360
calling word for this industry yeah I'm

481
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:40,119

482
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:42,439

647
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,250
it looks like it's Bango it's banana

648
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,019
mango banana mango yeah I'll give it

649
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,619
that there's banana mango Terps in there

650
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,910
Terps

651
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:37,529
that is delicious I approve what is it

652
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,450
set at temperature-wise if I push the

653
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:41,099
second boom oh yeah if you went to the

654
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,299
third bump you would get a gnarly gnarly

655
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,009
rip out of this thing

656
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,529
the second bump oh I don't want to see

657
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,759
it a bump the second white was effective

658
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,349
but that third one would be more my

659
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,019
style and I feel like I just roast that

660
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:53,849
capsule and like two ribs but yeah I

661
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,009
like that yeah

662
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:59,099
it's much more polite on my lungs than

663
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:00,359
add a break that is certainly true it

664
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,709
doesn't feel like I just got punched in

665
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:07,079
the chest which I enjoy but that's gonna

666
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,470
do really well for times when I need

667
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:21,720
quicker medication and I can't use a

668
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:24,750
torch and such yeah honestly I really

669
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,700
like this product i sat on maybe I'm

670
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:31,680
below biased because I helped develop it

671
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,120
so I really like it but I just really

672
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,190
feel like it's a really easy-to-use

673
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,419
vaporizer the thing you're doing right

674
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,500
now unscrewing the bottom and then it

675
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,060
comes with that tool or you can push

676
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,559
everything right through it that's a

677
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,269
really cool idea I've never seen that as

678
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,119
a possibility on a vape pen usually once

679
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:47,220
they clog up there they're [ __ ]

680
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,709
several you can put alcohol through that

681
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:59,940
and everything you can dip q-tips and

682
00:29:49,710 --> 00:30:04,500
alcohol what Jeff was referring to was

683
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:07,410
okay so on on this device is gonna burn

684
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,849
you we saw that earlier because we were

685
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,860
just using it Lindsay needs adult

686
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:13,609
supervision sometime

687
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:16,428
always oh and a helmet so if you press

688
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:19,459
on the side of the mouthpiece on the top

689
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:24,170
you will actually be able to pop it off

690
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:27,319
and inside of it comes one of the little

691
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:30,620
tiny metal dab tools that like comes in

692
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,808
every single anything ever that's

693
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:34,849
connected to a small silicone mouthpiece

694
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:37,490
that's inside the mouthpiece right cool

695
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:40,879
down smooth yeah so it sits in there -

696
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:44,839
basically like absorb the heat but it

697
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,960
goes into the tunnel that goes into the

698
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:51,439
chamber that holds the capsule and when

699
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,640
you unscrew the bottom and you take the

700
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,450
capsule out and there is a little dab

701
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:02,179
tool that comes with the with the VY

702
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,240
it's it comes inside the parts it's the

703
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:07,160
thicker silver one it actually fits

704
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,798
through that hole on the top of the

705
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,740
mouthpiece and it goes through there and

706
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:15,829
through the chamber so if a capsule ever

707
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,808
gets a little too snug in there or it's

708
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:20,329
sticky from Hanjin exactly that's what I

709
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:22,720
see happening absolutely if you put one

710
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:25,099
of the wax capsules in there in it maybe

711
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,169
your piece and you just keep using it

712
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,539
very often it'll get stuck in there and

713
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:32,240
absolutely or if you're using the direct

714
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:34,339
load mode which I'll I'll talk about all

715
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,140
the modes in a second I guess the you

716
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:37,668
can like push through you can like push

717
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,009
the screen out and everything and it'll

718
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:42,710
be it nothing will get stuck and

719
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:44,960
everything is super easy to clean and no

720
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,360
issues you can literally run alcohol

721
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,980
through it no problems that's pretty rad

722
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,719
I want to ask you a random question so

723
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,190
let's talk about the three load modes

724
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,289
before I forget my question sure so the

725
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,490
three different load modes are read as

726
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,289
capsules which are these little

727
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,720
stainless steel capsules that we were

728
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,450
talking about that you preload and you

729
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,620
can put into the chamber blue is the

730
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:12,440
direct mode where you throw a screen

731
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:14,329
into the bottom of the chamber I guess

732
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,700
is technically the timekeeping oven yeah

733
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:19,069
if you throw it into the bottom of it

734
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,169
and then you you can pack herb on top of

735
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:22,539
that and you can also use the little

736
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:27,310
capsule holder to

737
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:28,720
put herb in it or underneath I'm man

738
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,099
I've been hanging out granny too much

739
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,839
I'm [ __ ] knocking [ __ ] oh sorry

740
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:33,909
granny like sonakshi's over yeah that

741
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,259
was a lot of cursing people that are

742
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,050
nowhere granny is like the queen of

743
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:39,730
knocking [ __ ] over glass is dangerous

744
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,319
around granny she likes to she's clumsy

745
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,150
I love her but I have to tell this story

746
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,730
so yesterday we're walking out of can of

747
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,680
Canyon and she threw the back door so

748
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,620
hard that I honestly thought she broke

749
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,990
that plastic cabinet that was there and

750
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:54,639
I was like Gail that was really hard and

751
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,779
she's like she turns around and looks at

752
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,770
everybody in the club and she's just

753
00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:01,539
like god everyone just started laughing

754
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,589
and I'm like oh my god she really almost

755
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:07,930
broke bad I love you but like that was

756
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:09,669
walking out she's like I think she said

757
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,110
her dad used to say all the time Kevin

758
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,960
says all the time that she doesn't know

759
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:16,629
her own strength she really doesn't

760
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,890
she's like crazy Grammy I miss you and I

761

763
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,279
bottom underneath like oh look how

764
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,740

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,980
this is this works for two different

767
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,019
things it works for packing the capsules

768
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,660
cuz it fits into those oh and it also

769
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,789
works for the direct mode that's pretty

770
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,470

779
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,470
know when it's hot by vibrating zone

780
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:00,819
it's got a standby mode so if it like

781
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,789
it'll like keep the chamber

782
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:11,380

793
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,608
very small version of that kind of looks

794
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,250
like

795
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:40,809
man it's almost like a piece of ceramic

796
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,019
kind of but it's got more it's more

797
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:45,519
porous so it will hold heat and it kind

798
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:47,369

showcasing honestly like a small caliber

804
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:07,420
shell casing is what it looks like and

805
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,348
you just load them up with wax and you

806
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,780
put them right in the bottom there you

807

screw that on click it three times to

808
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,690
turn it on you make sure it's on the

809
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:16,449
right mode and then you hold the button

810
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,159
so the way to change the mode so the

811
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,598
temperature settings are on the bottom

812
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,578
so you can change the temperature

813
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,430
setting just by pressing that button on

814
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,539
the bottom one time it goes from yeah

815
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:29,559
there's four different heat settings

816
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:32,469
there are numerical numbers to this and

817
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,809
you can check in the starters guide for

818
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:36,309
the actual like if you want to know the

819
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:40,029
actual numerical numbers for what each

820
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:41,440
one is it's in there so in order to

821
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,599
change it between the different modes

822
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,880
you hold the temp button on the bottom

823
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,700
of the device and then you can actually

824
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,170
click through the different you can

825
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:54,759
actually click through the different

826
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,500
colors so blue red or and then it knows

827
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,910
if you're using a wax container an herb

828
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,809
container or if you're just raw doggin

829
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:06,699
it absolutely that's what it's supposed

830
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:08,318
to do and it's nice because that thing

831
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:10,269
actually has more than four heat

832
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,119
settings because since it has three

833
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:15,759
modes each mode has its own technique

834
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,920
setting alright so you can technically

835
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,599
get really crazy with it and find your

836
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,490
own personal liking and you might be

837
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,890
like well I don't like the direct mode

838
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:25,719
right with the capsules if you could put

839
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:27,789
it on direct mode turn it up high put a

840
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:31,659
capsule in or you could play with it

841
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:33,159
okay so there's really like 30 so you

842
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:35,980
really it's really a person that's a

843
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:39,058
crazy math equation

844
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,059
[Music]

845
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,009
okay I'm already lost I was never good

846
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:46,149
at probability in high school I didn't

847
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:55,569
even know the name of the [ __ ] class

848
00:36:46,150 --> 00:37:05,318
was so you got my god maybe I was ahead

849
00:36:55,568 --> 00:37:07,838
the probability of me showing up because

850
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:10,869
I didn't go to school I'm a good student

851
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,038
when the schooling is right I had a

852
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:14,710
question that I wanted to ask you is

853
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,819
this your first focus group yes what do

854
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,960
you think about the focus group thing

855
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:20,548
because it seems like you're gonna do it

856
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,920
a lot um do you know what I was very

857
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:27,159
happy with how receptive they were to

858
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,579
our ideas and to our input nice I feel

859
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:33,460
like there was not one thing that I

860
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,470
I hope Barack hears this button like

861
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,170
listens to this he calls this the

862
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:42,009
Lindsey dill Lindsey Mays yeah the

863
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,599
Lindsey Mays because I would we I would

864
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,400
make Chris do it first and I because

865
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,220
they would like it would get so hot Jeff

866
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,599
that it would burn your mouth the first

867
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,578
we're figuring out the heat settings the

868
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:57,068
first couple like hits were a little hot

869
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:58,839
on the first like one or two hit if they

870
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:00,699
made me do it first I would be like I

871
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:02,889
would touch it like here first but I

872
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:05,108
would really like test it on my lip

873
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:07,690
before because it would get really hot

874
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:09,038
like blistering I was like no way so he

875
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,750
calls that the Linds may said Lindsey

876
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,549
would complain so much and Lindsey would

877
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,309
make it such an issue that I had to fix

878
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:17,259
it so that dabbed tools thing in their

879
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:20,048
setup I mean like you don't have to keep

880
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,520
it in there but it just piece of metal

881
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:24,009
is gonna suck up the heat it cools down

882
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,608
the vapor everything it's really nice my

883
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,609
hands are all sweaty

884
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:33,459
nice yeah it doesn't go anywhere which

885
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,720
is yeah that's pretty smooth and it sits

886
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,389
nicely in there because a little piece

887
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,828
of the rubber the silicon that just

888
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:40,868
cools you down so you don't fry yourself

889
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:44,140
super smart and it doesn't restrict the

890
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:45,670
airflow at all I like that genius genius

891
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:48,179
genius what other products are you

892
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:53,159
sitting in on and developing

893
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:57,000
nothing nothing your poker face

894
00:38:53,159 --> 00:39:01,139
sucks I can't wait to hear about it

895
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,940
whatever the next product is what the

896
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,379
the podcasters don't want to hear that

897
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,490
[ __ ] she's gonna tell us when I stop

898
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,010
recording so I'm gonna reach over for

899
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:12,328
that but you won't stop for me dying

900
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,309
no I was lying I was gonna tell you I

901
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,650
stopped at not so that you told that's

902
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:27,480
gonna lie to your face because we're

903
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:30,450
friends so thanks to vie for this sweet

904
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,010
tester I've got number 248 of 400 I'm

905
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,750
gonna use this [ __ ] out of this I'm

906
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,700
going to let them know what I think you

907
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,639
will see this on my social media because

908
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:40,980
it already fits well in my hand I see it

909
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,578
becoming a pacifier this will shut me up

910
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,079
at certain times next week when Jeff's

911
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,440
like I put all my rings away for some

912
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,940
reason all I do is dive out of the vibe

913
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:58,068
just see me posted just nothing but

914

00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,239
years old you guys we've been on this

962
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:56,949
podcast for two years I'm not certain of

963
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,949
the birth date of this show I haven't

964
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:02,559
done a lot of research but right around

965
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:04,779
4:20 ish is when this podcast started

00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,780
make me want to do research I could

971
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:17,980
probably do research somebody talked for

972
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,390
a couple of seconds oh you know what I

973
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,940
can't do it because I don't want to [ __ ]

974
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,108
it up you know what I think we've been

975
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,230
out here for a year and four months

976
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:28,750
because it's April now so it's been two

977
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,039
years would make sense then and a

978
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,699
hundred and two hundred episodes that

979
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,500
makes sense to me sometimes I do also

980
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:39,669
because I can't remember not doing it if

981
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:46,769
that makes any sense I'm like and it

982
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:52,300

00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:09,719

00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:22,390

seconds he's like here's the answer dude

998
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:31,809
like that it might not have been Fred it

999
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:32,548
might have been somebody else I know who

1000
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:36,819
it was

1001
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:39,068
might have been Rich Gannon maybe yeah

1002
00:43:36,818 --> 00:43:41,318
trying to get those names right I don't

1003
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:44,639

1054
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,750
you're gonna do it you've said it if you

1055
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,570
can't do it by the first of next month

1056
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,750
then I got a troll you'll do it the

1057
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:06,580
podcast has a YouTube channel there are

1058
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,050
25 videos that you can see and there are

1059
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:10,750
a few more that you can't see they're

1060
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:12,940
still private once I get 50 videos made

1061
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,550
and posted to youtube I will let all 50

1062
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,980
of them be viewable because the viewers

1063
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:19,870
slash listeners are [ __ ] savages and

1064
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,789
the new trend is to binge watch

1065
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:23,289
everything it's like oh I'll just wait

1066
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:25,000
til he puts out a hundred episodes and

1067
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:26,590
I'll stay up for four days and drink dr.

1068
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,570
pepper and smoke dabs and just listen to

1069
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,160
every [ __ ] episode and then send him

1070
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:32,200
an email about every single one

1071
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,849
back-to-back that's what people do now

1072
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:36,879
feels like but I love it listen how you

1073
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:38,230
want to I've got at least like 25 more

1074
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,309
to put out there people are just gonna

1075
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,809
eat them up and they're gonna look at

1076
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:43,779
you like a hungry crocodile like where's

1077
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:46,000
the next one I love it but it's harder

1078
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,320
to keep up I can only imagine yeah yeah

1079
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,820
and I love it I want to keep doing this

1080
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,380
podcast because I love put it out there

1081
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,480
for people but sometimes it is a

1082
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,970
challenge keeping the hungry mouths the

1083
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:00,760

00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,809
their products this much are educated

1109
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,849
because we have passion it's not even an

1110
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,110
education it's just a passion like when

1111
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:03,429
I heard somebody talking about seeds

1112
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,590
today and they said something that was

1113
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:08,769
not wrong but slightly inaccurate and I

1114
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:10,539
had tried to bite my lip but it flew out

1115
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,860
of my face is like minute that's not

1116
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,969
true because of this and I'm sorry to

1117
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,070
have to interrupt you to correct you but

1118
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:17,079
I just couldn't hold it this is the back

1119
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,309
part I still love you you're still cool

1120
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,139
as [ __ ] but let me tell you the truth

1121
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:25,509
here the passion I feel like a cannabis

1122
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:27,489
historians sometimes like I have to I'm

1123
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,040
preserving the cannabis future when it

1124
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:32,259
comes to genetics and the stories and

1125
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:34,329
the way it evolved with legalization

1126
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,520
here in Colorado where historians we're

1127
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:38,739
here we're the frontlines we've got to

1128
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,019
report the truth I feel like telling

1129
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:42,639
people what crosses of certain strains

1130
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,110
are I feel like that's super important

1131
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:45,549
because we're only gonna cross those

1132
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,360
strains with more strains and more

1133
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:51,100
strains and yeah yeah it's get more

1134
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,019
convoluted as it goes and I think it's

1135
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:54,549
super important to kind of I like to be

1136
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:56,530
sort of a historian I'm sort of I got

1137
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,960
some OCD like that and it's one of the

1138
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,700
things I've volunteered to be what what

1139
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,099
is that an ambassador to this plant I

1140
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:04,809
feel like that's a part of my job I try

1141
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:06,339
to I try to be as accurate as I can so

1142
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,929
if I ever seem OCD about some weed

1143
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,910
that's why it's part of my

1144
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:11,109
responsibility I don't want that I want

1145
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:14,279
the factual [ __ ] out there not the

1146
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:16,210

1161
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,889
