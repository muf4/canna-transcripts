this table's a pretty damn experienced

166
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,919
grower uh we got I'd call myself a

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
breeder Jesse's a poen chucker maybe a

168
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,680
breeder I don't know if he'd call

169
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,839
himself a breeder yet uh more practice

170
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,160
Spence is a hell of a grower uh we had

171
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,839
some stuff tested and Spence is tested

172
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,039
higher than all of my stuff and he grew

173
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,679
somebody else's strain do you remember

174
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,120
what the numbers were bro um Capleton

175
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,879
was

176
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,079
20%

177
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,960
um there's a Girl Scout cookie cross

178
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:13,198
which was crippy OG and Girl Scout it

179
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,560
was 25 maybe 24 probably 24 um Ryan

180
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,759
Rhino 100% sativa

181
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,240
25% um and then form Scout or form Girl

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
Scout cookies tested at right around 27

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,199
so this guy crushed it he had some great

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,280
great tests uh my veganic lemon Jeffrey

185
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,759
tested right around 24% if that gives

186
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,959
you some which by the way that was was

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,360
awesome some of the best veganic weed

188
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,878
I've probably ever smoked well thank you

189
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,400
uh how much veganic weed have you smoked

190
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,680
do you know um I've smoked some I've

191
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:41,519
smoked some from uh there's a place in

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,639
the springs I think it's natural Mystics

193
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,680
they sell it um that's really the only

194
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,158
really place and then I tried some of uh

195
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,439
Buds and Roses at the cups and that was

196
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,079
kle kushan so mine stood up to Kyle

197
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,319
kushman's huh definitely that's a hell

198
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,399
of a comp it's a different it's

199
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,158
definitely a you have a thing for

200
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,719
sativas and not a lot of people like

201
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:05,360
sativ but I like the you know the

202
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,800
citrusy really high high so I think

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,840
letting a PL take more time to grow like

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,759
a sativa does let you get more out of it

205
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,000
it's nothing but the longer the better

206
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,598
in my opinion for sure depending on your

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Technique you know what I'm saying yeah

208
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,439
yeah guys quit cutting your plants down

209
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,199
too early all right so yeah that was

210
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,120
just uh and Jesse to give him some

211
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,960
credit in the game he won the PUO super

212
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,360
Bud bow and they gave him hella huge

213
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,959
compliments if you guys listened to past

214
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,598
episodes we talked about that uh the

215
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,759
judges of the super Bud bow said that

216
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,958
Jesse strain stood out in flavor Aroma

217
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,639
taste and effect overall without a doubt

218
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,439
he was the hands down winner the

219
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,598
freaking champ right yes gra OG like

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,719
that yes grap OG uh it's hell of a

221
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,240
strange too I took some cuts of it today

222
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,640
awes we'll see what happens so these

223
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,120
guys are we're all experienced Growers

224
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,639
here I'm of course the breeder from my

225
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,720
genetics so I know what I'm doing uh

226
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,639
we're going to talk a little bit about

227
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,639
clones and seeds do you guys do you have

228
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,360
a preference Jesse from gr growing from

229
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,039
clone or

230
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,759
seed um has more to do with the end

231
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,838
mission I guess of you know whatever

232
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,559
particular round but

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,760
uh um I'd grow from seed uh if that was

234
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,799
you know all I could do from now on okay

235
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,838
so if you're going to set up I guess a

236
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,919
better question would be if you're going

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,120
to set up a giant Warehouse not a giant

238
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,319
what if I give you 20 lights and I 20

239
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,519
flowering lights uh and it's all yours

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,480
you're going to start brand new would

241
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,480
you grow from clones or seeds at that

242
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,839
point um I'd probably go with clones

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,759
okay cool all right how about you Spence

244
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,000
if you had 20 light to play with go um

245
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,240
if I had it to play with I'd probably

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,839
take like two lights and maybe do some

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,000
C's but yeah there's just you know when

248
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,120
you're that that scale you want

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,720
something that's proven to give you what

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,919
you want that's a perfect segue into

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,519
what I was going to say clones uh the

252
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,599
pros of clones are that you know you've

253
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,000
got females uh those have been ran and

254
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,360
tested so if you've got a clone I'll

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,519
talk a little bit about a clone and give

256
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,879
some setup for what they are cuz people

257
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,399
are new listeners uh clone is a cutting

258
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,120
taken from a plant a mother plant that

259
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,600
you hopefully have ran before and

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,440
flowered out and you know that that's

261
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,680
some good [ __ ] or someone else has or

262
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,360
someone else has one of your trusted

263
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,719
Bros like Spence or Jesse at the table

264
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,639
if they give me a clo I definitely

265
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,360
appreciate it and trust it uh I don't

266
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,679
usually get dispensary clones and stuff

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
they're mediocre most of the time uh so

268
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,599
you got to know who you're getting it

269
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,159
from but usually it's a reliable crop

270
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,720
it's a female uh you're familiar with it

271
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,679
somebody in the crew has grown it we can

272
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
say that takes 8 weeks that takes N9

273
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,359
weeks that takes 10 weeks or be careful

274
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
cuz that [ __ ] might Herm if you over

275
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,720
nitrogen it you know there there's

276
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,519
things we know so that's one of the

277
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,759
super super pros of a a clone we know

278
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,000
the growth patterns we know if we need

279
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,278
to top it uh we know if we need to train

280
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,679
it a little bit we know how tall it's

281
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,320
going to get I know that the sour diesel

282
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,838
cut I've got if you let it grow more

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,680
than 2 feet tall in Veg it's going to be

284
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,079
8 ft tall in flour and I know that from

285
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,039
we've grown it several times I think I

286
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,159
grew that one time and I learned yeah

287
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,879
you learned quick on that [ __ ] tickling

288
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,759
your lights uh and then you know what to

289
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,919
feed it also uh because you know how

290
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,039
long it's going to take you know when to

291
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,120
begin flushing you know when it's going

292
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,439
to be done the cons of clones this is

293
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,560
why I was asking about the giant

294
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,040
Warehouse uh clones are where you get

295
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,559
most of your damn bugs I think when some

296
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,120
one of your buddies tries to give you a

297
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,759
sweet cut of Sour Diesel and you get it

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,759
to your garden and you're irresponsible

299
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,759
and it's partly your responsibility to

300
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,439
quarantine and treat that thing but uh

301
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,078
sometimes you fail yourself just like

302
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,720
that guy did and you end up with uh

303
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,958
spider mites the the feared hemp russet

304
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,759
might in your weed Garden right now

305
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,599
those will take down your entire crop in

306
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,480
two days I had a friend tell me he had

307
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,079
those he's like you want to see them

308
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,320
nope I don't even want to see you

309
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,879
anymore if you get ever get those just

310
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,160
start over yeah yeah fire is the cure I

311
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,078
actually uh I have something I'm

312
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,278
experimenting with a product I don't

313
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,159
know if I've mentioned it on the show

314
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,439
because I don't want to say anything

315
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,838
until I'm familiar with it uh it seems

316
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
to kill everything uhuh unfortunately if

317
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,519
you do it wrong it will kill everything

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,958
yeah I I volunteered a few plants and I

319
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,000
did a few different applications and a

320
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,159
couple of them

321
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
them yeah but if I learn to do it right

322
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,559
I feel like it'll work well so I'm going

323
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,759
to learn it that's going to make you

324
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,719
hard to hear Jesse's afraid of the

325
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,799
microphone there we that's that's

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
awesome dude right there we could hear

327
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,359
you all day just like that see I keep

328
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,240
worried about that oh that's cool that

329
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,720
if you guys are wondering what that

330
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,198
furry sound is it's music in the

331
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,600
background it's not Jesse's beard

332
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,198
rubbing on the microphone so we get our

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,240
bugs our problems our diseases our

334
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,078
pathogens uh powdery mildew comes from

335
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,360
clones uh seeds do not carry bugs they

336
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,439
do not carry diseases they do not carry

337
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,480
pathogens uh something about a clone if

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
uh if I grow a pack of seeds and I pick

339
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,399
the keeper out of that so you grow 10

340
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,239
seeds there'll be different phenotypes

341
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
in there hopefully uh you find that one

342
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,959
that's Stellar maybe my opinion of that

343
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
Stellar plant is way different than

344
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,759
Spence's opinion or way different than

345
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,198
Jesse's opinion or the other guy growing

346
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,480
or so you I like the ability to pick my

347
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,639
own which is a benefit of the seed and a

348
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,199
of the

349
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
Clone and maybe my grow style or what

350
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,919
I'm looking for is way different than

351
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
what you guys are looking for yeah when

352
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,000
you get a 10 pack of seeds how many

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
Keepers do you hope to find out of those

354
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,078
do you hope for that just one or are you

355
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,799
looking for all 10 of them I usually um

356
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,479
I just look for differences throughout

357
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,838
cuz some of them depending on what

358
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,600
you're you know what kind of seats

359
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,639
you're poping you'll find differences

360
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,199
and whatnot so I usually try to keep

361
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,278
three just so I have a you know if I

362
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:26,000
have three plants that don't all look

363
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,439
the same maybe you know I just want a

364
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
better chance of finding something

365
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,519
that's not as or that's better than one

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,078
of the other it's good that you say

367
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,679
three in my opinion because usually I

368
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,439
find the one that looks like if you're

369
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,000
crossing a male and a female plant I

370
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
like to find the male like the one that

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,839
looks like the male one that looks like

372
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
the female and then that one that's a

373
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,279
hybrid of the two yeah that's usually a

374
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,639
good good way to do it and then uh smoke

375
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,320
all those get them tested do what you

376
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,519
can have the crew smoke them make

377
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
shatter out of them make live resin out

378
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,240
of them see what happens with all that

379
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
stuff cure them a long time cure them a

380
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,159
long time that's something I failed at

381
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,439
when I was a new grower I would take

382
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,399
that stuff and as soon as it was dry

383
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,720
enough to start smoking i' start smoking

384
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,720
it up see which was my favorite I'm sure

385
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,560
I got rid of a few Keepers that I just

386
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,000
didn't even know yet man yeah yeah so I

387
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,879
guess that leads us into seeds a little

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,919
bit when you buy a 10 pack of seeds I

389
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,600
really like that variation so you buy a

390
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,120
10 pack you pop them sometimes there's

391
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,440
[ __ ] seven males in there oh God yeah

392
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,919
but that that's nature it does happen

393
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,320
it's a numbers game uh it's like Bingo

394
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,639
it is like bingo so hopefully you get

395
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,480
that one good one so hopefully get some

396
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,720
five five males five females is usually

397
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,800
what I hope for somewhere in that area

398
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,199
uh you hope to get one that you can spot

399
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,599
right away that you're like e we got to

400
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,039
call that [ __ ] and then you got those

401
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,879
four to work with and like Spence said

402
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,958
you get three so that's where you find

403
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,320
new stuff uh that's one of the pros of

404
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,919
growing from seed you find all that new

405
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,160
stuff and here's something I thought

406
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,479
about earlier everything we're growing

407
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,278
came from seed in the first place

408
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,519
nothing down the road it came from the

409
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,600
SE the way it's supposed to be yeah yeah

410
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,600
we couldn't have a plant without the

411
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,079
seed we nobody took took a clone of OG

412
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,519
kush yeah they if everyone you know

413
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:09,159
keeps growing from clone

414
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,679
um there are uh very bad consequences to

415
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,198
that so what could happen um big major

416
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:20,120
companies could maintain control of it

417
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:23,000
um of the seed stock um similar to some

418
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,360
ornamental flowers uh that I can't quote

419
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,799
species of or anything like that but

420
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,159
okay I know it's really hard to find

421
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,719
like genuine seed of sunflowers yeah and

422
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,639
a lot of the vegetables you can only

423
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,000
find specific seeds Okay damn see so we

424
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
it's there you go more beneficial to

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,480
grow from seed or a benefit of growing

426
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,039
from seed or they'll just start selling

427
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,600
only f i seed and you know that just

428
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,399
there won't be a Jee pool no more and

429
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,199
that's something as a breeder I try to

430
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,360
pay attention too I try to make and you

431
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,919
guys have probably noticed I've been

432
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,560
pulling out a lot more reg seeds lately

433
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,719
we got to have reg seeds because it you

434
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,278
got to have the males to keep the

435
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,120
breeding alive or it's going to get

436
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,600
stale uh F1 hybrids or where it's at and

437
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,919
guys if you're breeding please throw

438
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
away the [ __ ] there's going to be

439
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,639
some stuff that comes out of your

440
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,278
breeding projects that is not worth

441
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,039
rebreeding or giving out those seeds

442
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,799
just toss those cuz you're polluting the

443
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,000
gene pool you're making it weak uh

444
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,559
you're making a bunch of runts and

445
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,278
mutants and you're [ __ ] it up just

446
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,198
get rid of all that non- Elite stuff or

447
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,600
non- Elite stuff yeah all the poser

448
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,919
stuff and just kill it dude just kill it

449
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,519
we can breed more seeds there's more

450
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,439
coming I definitely give props to the

451
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,519
people who actually try their own seeds

452
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,800
like if you if you produce some seeds

453
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,519
actually grow it see what it is before

454
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,799
you give it to people for give a bunch

455
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
of it away also uh give them away so

456
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,039
that other people can so you can see

457
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,480
what Nancy budwell shout out to Nancy

458
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,240
budwell what she shout out to Nancy man

459
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,480
that lady grows some fun cannabis under

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,399
under LEDs I'm not even a big fan of

461
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
LEDs and she is killing it with that

462
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,679
[ __ ] bro yeah yeah so yeah I'm actually

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,039
I like that you say that you keep saying

464
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,399
good [ __ ] to make more good [ __ ] to talk

465
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:53,278
about I'm growing the Night Nurse right

466
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,759
now and dude she looks Stellar there's

467
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,078
one that looks really grateful dog

468
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,399
dominant but smells like torab Bora

469
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,719
maybe it'll pass those CBDs right I hope

470
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,799
so I hope so we need some good CBD

471
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,400
medicine so the with the seeds you get

472
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,198
new stuff like we were talking about uh

473
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,880
you get to do that phenotype hunt uh

474
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,558
that's uh that's essentially when you

475
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,919
pop a pack of seeds they call it mapping

476
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,000
or searching or hunting subcool calls it

477
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,520
something different I forgot what even

478
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,558
calls it but it's a feno hunt in this

479
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,199
group is what we call it uh you run as

480
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,038
many seeds as you can get of one strain

481
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,759
if you can do 20 of them do 20 that's

482
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:26,558
awesome 25 of something is cool uh if

483
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,318
you've only got a 10 or a six- pack or a

484
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,000
five pack that works too just work on

485
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,678
your scale but the more the better

486
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,558
because that gives you you can see what

487
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,798
that strin potential is and you know

488
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,359
what you're looking for a little better

489
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,440
and you can get that one like I know

490
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,519
what I want out of a Grateful Dog pack

491
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
of beans you may want something totally

492
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,720
different out of a pack of dog beans uh

493
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,439
and we'll find it by doing that feno

494
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,919
hunt and that's fun to me running that

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,558
hunt seeing the variations and as a

496
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,720
breeder I love seeing the variations

497
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:56,158
from my Creations that's a lot of fun uh

498
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,600
if we're growing clones we're all

499
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,120
growing the same [ __ ] uh there's a blue

500
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,480
dram dream cut going around this town

501
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,839
right now going around Colorado I don't

502
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,440
think it's just this town no no I think

503
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,158
it is just Colorado in general that like

504
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
every time I see somebody post a picture

505
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,760
of Blue Dream is like dear God there it

506
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,720
is again it's the same Blue Dream thing

507
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,359
harvests heavy though oh yeah I love it

508
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,400
dude it'll grow in any type of

509
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,158
conditions and she'll she'll give you

510
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
some product back if you're good to her

511
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,400
oh yeah yeah I can pull uh 6 ounces out

512
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,200
of a 7 gallon pot with four of them per

513
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,919
light so that's a pound and a half a

514
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,960
herb yeah uh let her go about 70 days

515
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,559
Andy she packs it on is that Andy's Blue

516
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Dream cut yeah shout out to Andy shout

517
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:38,279
out what's up ABD yeah come get your

518
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,279
stuff

519
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:43,439
back we're we're cool we're done we love

520
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,879
it so much we hate it it's so good that

521
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
it's just terrible uh no we love the

522
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,280
Andy's blue dream I didn't mean to call

523
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,200
it terrible uh how about the uh the cons

524
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,200
of growing from seed some people are not

525
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,038
good at spotting males that's the main

526
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,360
problem yeah um I would I mean if you're

527
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,679
a beginner grower you know sometimes you

528
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,558
don't even know like I know people that

529
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,080
have seen male plants and like is there

530
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,720
ever going to be flowers from there and

531
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,199
it's like no these are two completely

532
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,519
different things um and I just think

533
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,159
it's about paying attention if you pay

534
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,839
attention there's there's you've got to

535
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,320
see it yeah read a book read a book yeah

536
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,038
every grow book has a picture of a male

537
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,879
and a female right next to each other

538
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,359
yep yep so yeah spot your males what

539
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
about mutants sometimes you get that

540
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,639
crazy mutant [ __ ] they're fun they

541
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,720
they're funky they're definitely K dog

542
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,400
is a

543
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,400
mutant the person or

544
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,720
the both both shout out to Kim dog and

545
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,038
if you're wrri in Kim dog it's c h m d

546
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,919
OG yeah do he corrected us it's dog

547
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,960
shout out Kim dog I used to have a dog

548
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,000
name that that's pretty awesome no do do

549
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
uh my buddy Ryan had a dog named dog he

550
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,279
was a cool ass dog cool dog what's up

551
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,399
guys I miss you I haven't seen you guys

552
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,519
in a long time you don't listen to the

553
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,960
show but still thinking about you um

554
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,879
selection time uh when you're growing

555
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,919
from seeds there's always that pheno

556
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,080
when you're growing from clones that

557
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
first crop you're going to grow that's

558
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,359
Blue Dream you're cool you got all the

559
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,399
Blue Dream you can handle uh when you're

560
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,199
running from seed you got to run a crop

561
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,120
to find what you're even messing with

562
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,159
and then run a crop to keep again of the

563
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,479
ones you like right and then if you need

564
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,240
to eliminate more then you're going to

565
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,480
run it again again and again and narrow

566
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,919
it down yep so uh and then hopefully you

567
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,798
take clones like I said on another

568
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,038
episode take clones of everything you

569
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,000
ever grow before it's in flow right

570
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,480
before you fly like yeah 15 days before

571
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,558
you put it in flow take some clones that

572
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,400
way you know those clones are going to

573
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,279
root and if you don't have clones you

574
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,360
can try again like give yourself a

575
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,839
chance plan ahead plan ahead when you're

576
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,918
growing it's always uh it's always

577
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,359
beneficial uh give yourself the

578
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,679
advantage yeah yeah the advantage the

579
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,759
heads up for yourself is don't put

580
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,120
yourself behind because once you're

581
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,839
behind and growing you're behind and

582
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,678
growing and that probably means your

583
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,720
plants are stressed out yeah if you're

584
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,159
stressed they

585
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,159
are you ain't

586
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,759
lying so uh the cons of seeds uh if you

587
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,079
need you got to learn each phenotype

588
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,679
like when you find those phenotypes you

589
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,879
got to learn them and you got to learn

590
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,360
it's like having three different

591
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
girlfriends if you found three Keepers

592
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,079
one's going to like a lot of nitrogen

593
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,240
one's going to get mad at too much

594
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,079
nitrogen one's going to be really picky

595
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,359
one's going to be really easy one's

596
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,199
going to butt out one's going to taste

597
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,839
real good you're going to have to learn

598
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
each phenotype one may go a little

599
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,359
longer one may come down a little sooner

600
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,880
one may need to be topped one may climb

601
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,240
up into the [ __ ] lights Real High you

602
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,120
got to learn all that stuff uh the con

603
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,359
of course that comes with that is wasted

604
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,798
space so if you're a cash Cropper the

605
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,119
the seeds that kind of messes you up but

606
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,158
what about fem

607
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,359
seeds I've seen it I've I mean I've

608
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
grown fam seeds I i' make and grow [ __ ]

609
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,079
tons of

610
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,080
seed they take away

611
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,359
the worry about having a male there are

612
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,000
still chances where you'll get some

613
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,038
funky stuff but you just got to still

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,798
pay attention I've made some funky stuff

615
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,038
you've grown some funky stuff for me

616
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,359
that uh I'm not even going to say the

617
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,919
strain to discourage anybody but it's

618
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,519
still good though don't worry because

619
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm seeing excellent phenotypes coming

620
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,839
out I've got some downstairs that looks

621
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,439
gnarly uh Spence grew one that shot out

622
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,759
it was shot out a stick with a gigantic

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,880
Leaf the size of bigger than my hand and

624
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,519
then another stick and then like normal

625
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,400
size leaves then I don't even remember

626
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,119
went on cuz I just looked away I was

627
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,200
like uh it was like seeing a car wreck

628
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,759
you can look for a minute but then

629
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,960
you're like [ __ ] it had a reattach

630
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,599
amputate arm but it was cool like I I

631
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,519
like sometimes I like things like that

632
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,798
you know if it's going to be a female

633
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,839
I'm the type of girl where I'll give it

634
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,359
a chance if it doesn't if it doesn't

635
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,000
work it doesn't work yeah there's always

636
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,599
more seeds to plant there are always

637
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,159
more seeds yeah don't be afraid to call

638
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,959
something man like if you guys have

639
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
something that is a level eight let's

640
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,840
work on getting you guys a level 10 on

641
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,798
SE yeah get you some good seeds some

642
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:51,480
regular F yeah exactly survival the F

643
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,879
survival the fittest and I know seeds

644
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,519
are expensive and we just talk like you

645

femin seeds always females most of the

754
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:09,798
time uh I'll say 99% of the time females

755
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,640

762
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:27,079

763
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,278
blank like when you're at a house and

764

765
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,919
di quick you just went and you came back

766
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,240
right fast like where were we uh did you

767
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,278
get a bunch of seeds from that run where

768
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,278
the owner [ __ ] it all yeah they they

769
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,960
had a bunch of seeds yeah oh man and

770
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,679
then uh they tried to sell them too well

771
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,399
that's a dispensary for you yeah they

772
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,360
had no idea and the problem with fem

773
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,918
seeds me being a femin seed maker I know

774
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,079
this is the big problem you don't know

775
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,759
you've got a problem until like week

776
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,759
seven or week eight when you've already

777
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,879
invested a lot of time into that plant

778
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,440
so if you're running fem seeds my advice

779
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,039
and this is what I do I flower them

780
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,798
little I run them in a three gallon pot

781
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,759
I veg them for very minimal time until I

782
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,158
can take three cuts off of them and once

783
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,960
they're all big enough for three Cuts I

784
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,720
flower them out the first time to find

785
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,278
out what I've got and then you can find

786
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,759
out if you've got trouble or if you've

787
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,480
got gold so go early with the F if you

788
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,558
can just to find out I would do that

789
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,880
with any

790
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:23,000

791
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,159

792
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,640

it's okay yeah I got my pass y'all

807
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,278
that's funny you guys brought up beer I

808
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,158
uh whoa nice you can hear now yeah

809
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,440
started working well I can kind of hear

810
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,278
now I can really hear um I have a beer

811
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,000
making friend um and we had a serious

812
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,038
conversation last night about making a

813
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,119
marijuana beer I would I don't drink but

814
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:19,038
I would try one of those yeah just to

815
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:21,119
say I drank a marijuana beer one that's

816
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,759
Spence and I might split it yeah for

817
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,918
sure I get I get a little turn off of

818
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,158
one beer we were talking about like a

819
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,960
really small recipe so and then you can

820
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,399
ferment that beer in your grow room and

821
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,200
use your weed beer CO2 to enhance your

822
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,759
ganja plants there you go would that be

823
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,159
a little sacrilegious cannibalistic

824
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,558
almost here's your fermenting Brothers

825
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,320
if you want it to be if you want it to

826
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,879
be all

827
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,200
right shout out to beer I miss you beer

828
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,720
I haven't had a beer in a long long time

829
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
I'm better off without it you know I

830
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,278
haven't had a beer since I got my very

831
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,440
first medical marijuana card that's when

832
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:57,480
I was like you know I don't need to

833
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,798
drink I got the card smoke all the herb

834
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,519
I want that's awesome yeah yeah nice

835
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,960
trade-off with myself my dad kind of

836
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,679
sorted the same thing he still drinks

837
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,919
occasionally shout out to Mr Whit if

838
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,880
you're uh if you're listening to the

839
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:14,200
show man what's up bro it's me what's up

840
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,880
pops he's a cool ass dude cool ass dude

841
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,519
so uh we're kind of ranting about fem

842
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,679
seeds a little bit uh fem seeds I've

843
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,640
noticed and you might you guys I don't

844
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,320
know if you've paid enough attention uh

845
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,038
cuz I'm looking more I'm the breeder uh

846
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,079
fem seeds are always a closer

847
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,319
representation of the parents I have

848
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,599
found you don't get as much like when we

849
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:34,359
run gauges f1s there's not there's not

850
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,240
as much variation is what you're saying

851
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,678
right okay uh fem seeds are more uniform

852
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,480
they're closer they look a lot alike

853
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,840
when we run gauges f1s we never know

854
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,839
what we're going to get a 10 pack varies

855
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,720
so much unless it was aspirare those

856
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,798
were awesome do you suppose that's

857
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,159
because they

858
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,440
are supposedly missing the male

859
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,399
chromosomes uh that and you're not

860
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,278
introducing it feels like uh when you're

861
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,199
bringing out the f1s I feel like you're

862
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,798
getting a lot of recessive traits and

863
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,558
you're just not bringing it could be

864
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,480
because of the male chromosomes are

865
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,079
missing but it feels like you're not

866
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,519
going back as far in the lineage they

867
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,558
forgot who their grandparents Were

868
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,679
Somehow just by selfing them it's what

869
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,079
it feels like and I'm also doing a lot

870
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,240
of selfing of one plant uh and using it

871
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,278
to pollinate the same strain so those

872
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,880
are starting to come out I've done that

873
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,119
I'm on the it would kind it's inbred but

874
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,320
it's kind of an F3 is what level I'm at

875
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:29,038
and they're so S3 yeah the Grateful Dog

876
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,599
S3 they are almost all looking the Same

877
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,079
by now oh nice I had no idea awesome

878
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,439
props on that well thank you thank you

879
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:36,720
that's that's a dank strain by the way

880
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,600
that's that's the one that put me on the

881
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,519
map honestly shout out to uh the Cali

882
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,879
Connection and swerve because uh just

883
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,440
shout out to those guys they did me a

884
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,679
favor so shout

885
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
out yeah I was going to actually uh

886
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,960
bring up in this conversation that uh

887
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:54,079
there's so many s1's and f1s out there

888
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,679
and uh you know we were talking about s

889
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,158
uh protecting the lineage and everything

890
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,840
and you can't really do that with f1's

891
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,480
s1's so yeah you got to F3 it you got to

892
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,199
get to F34 you know DJ Short says F2 is

893
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,639
crucial really that's where a lot of

894
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,080
stuff is really where you got to pay

895
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:13,119
attention cuz I've I've [ __ ] up the

896
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:16,678
f2s I've been like oh no I used the

897
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,398
wrong I chose the wrong the wrong F1 to

898
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,880
put to that and then was like nope

899
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,398
that's not I I got to go find a

900
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,799
different mail out of this mix cuz this

901
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,079
is not where or a different female and

902
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,480
try this again for sure you just have to

903
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,000
go back you have to keep seeds of each

904
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,839
one label them what they were like this

905
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,480
is the I'll say Golden Goat times

906
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:36,359
daybreaker this is the first run and

907
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,880
make sure that those are legit and then

908
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,278
find a I want to find a Golden Goat

909
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,840
dominant one out of there and hit it

910
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,319
again with the daybreaker mail and I'm

911
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,599
hoping to make it look a lot like

912
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,558
daybreaker and smell like Golden Goat I

913
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:51,759
have the goats the goat Vigor but if it

914
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,599
doesn't I could just have to back up

915
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,759
again and go find another female to use

916
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,398
and just keep yeah eventually I'll ditch

917
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,679
a project if I have to go back too many

918
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:00,839
times twice if I don't get it the first

919
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
or second time I'm like yeah that

920
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,079
obviously doesn't want to do what I want

921
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,840
it to do out of so many seeds you should

922
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,879
get what you want the first or second

923
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:12,480
first or second try I uh the depot Dog

924
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,278
Strain I had uh or have um I had to do

925
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,079
it three times before I was happy with

926
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,919
it the first time there you go and then

927
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,798
continued from there so due to like

928
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,120
leaks and stuff like that oh man and

929
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,000
something in me says if it doesn't work

930
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,079
the first time or the second time I'm

931
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,359
probably not going to get what I want I

932
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,960
keep cutting that music got a little too

933
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,798
much sorry uh here's a random this is

934
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,360
kind of off topic but on topic how do

935
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,079
you guys feel have you seen where Arian

936
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,359
goes to places Arian from greenhouse

937
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,558
seeds they travel to places and get land

938
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,398
race genetics from I'll say Jamaica and

939
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,879
they went to like uh uh they went to

940
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,879
somewhere in India Nepal or somewhere

941
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
like that I don't pay enough attention I

942
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,720
just have to watch things quickly while

943
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,638
I'm trimming so uh they go to these

944
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,120
places and they get their land rais

945
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:57,398
seeds and so now aran's got all land

946
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,558
races from everywhere mhm but in

947
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,798
exchange

948
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,000
he leaves them a handful of seeds fem

949
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:06,200
seeds F seed fem seeds and he'll give

950
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,638
them F and rs but he gives them handfuls

951
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,800
of seeds to grow and he tells them what

952
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:13,799
they are but now those land races are

953
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,480
gone yeah because cross back over it's

954
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,359
just open pollination on it they don't

955
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,559
care and he just made off with the last

956
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,480
of with the last of the land seeds

957
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,199
introducing hybrids and modern and

958
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,440
developed World genetics into fragile

959
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,719
places that have land race genetics like

960
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,200
that is

961
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,158
a um that's kind of a douchebag thing to

962
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,039
do that's the nicest way I can say it

963
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,760
it's the same thing is uh releasing

964
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,159
[ __ ] uh animals that are not from

965
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,079
that area yeah for sure or insects that

966
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,559
are not from that area they're going to

967
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,000
wreak havoc on [ __ ] and destroy the

968
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,039
ecosystem that's already there and

969
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,559
disrupt the balance we're asking all the

970
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,878
farmers to grow some GMO corn yeah

971
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,078
that's he's kind of doing the same thing

972
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,358
to them yeah yeah huh guys think about

973
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,359
that when you're uh when you're doing

974
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:59,078
what you're doing kind of think about

975
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,239
the that you're having like the ripples

976
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,000
that you make in your life cuz little

977
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:05,598
stuff makes big big ripples what's that

978
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,559
saying about a butterfly in the

979
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,320
rainforest and a monsoon somewhere else

980
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,920
yeah yeah if uh if a hippie scratches

981
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,599
his nuts in PUO uh there's a Title Wave

982
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,880
in China somewhere something like that

983
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,240
happens yeah keep that in mind yeah so

984
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,200
all you hippie scratching your nuts be

985
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,639
careful you're causing tidle waves all

986
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,598
right so that was a random uh rant on

987
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,920
the pros and cons of seeds so I guess

988
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,800
the it's still uh I think they're cool

989
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,400
in my opinion I think there's benefits

990
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,680
of both there's a reason to run seeds

991
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,200
and there's a benefit to run clones and

992
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,759
as a seed breeder uh I should probably

993
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:39,399
big up the seeds a little bit more but

994
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,839
to tell you the truth uh all those

995
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,039
Famous Cuts that you're getting they're

996

1025
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,719
plants it's one thing I wanted to to

1026
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:55,000
mention that's okay let's just get

1027
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,959
whatever that's kind of how I feel uh

1028
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,519
Autoflower plants are that's just I will

1029
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,240
never breed people always ask me if I

1030
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:02,920
will make an Autoflower as a breeder and

1031
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,439
I always say no that's uh that's word

1032
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,440
that's not for big boys and then some

1033
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,119
people are going to hate me for saying

1034
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,358
that if you need a fast production crop

1035
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,000
and you're not familiar with the

1036
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:12,880
cannabis plant that may work for you but

1037
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,239
it's not connoisseur great Herb in my

1038
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,880
opinion Jesse and I are familiar with

1039
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:21,559
one Epic freaking use of Autoflower

1040
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,440
plants to discredit all the [ __ ] I just

1041
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:27,119
talked um we live in a community that is

1042
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,318
about 40 minutes away from a national

1043
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,519
forest uh maybe an hour depending on

1044
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:36,199
which routes you take uh there was a um

1045
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,960
a legendary [ __ ] bust of there was a

1046
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:42,919
Mexican cartel in the National Forest

1047
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,400
running a giant grow operation all year

1048
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,400
long uh very covertly in like a valley

1049
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,880
that they were hiking in and Hiking out

1050
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,920
they were camped there they found food

1051
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,960
there and said these guys had been

1052
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,559
camped for a month very very covertly

1053
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,559
yeah uh the people that own the land

1054
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,719
around there were oblivious to it and

1055
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,480
and they had irrigation system set up

1056
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,039
coming from the river running downhill

1057
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,240
watering all the plants uh it was

1058
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:10,000
perfect it was like a movie setup uh I

1059
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,439
can uh I mean they had three different

1060
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,199
places did you go out there yeah it was

1061
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,720
I mean it's it's hikable there's it's

1062
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,679
area where we can hike to Jess went out

1063
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:20,598
there and hiked so we'll let them tell

1064
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:24,318
you about it I mean they they clearcut a

1065
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,599
good 7 Acres of you know just Prime

1066
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:29,400
national forest trees you know full

1067
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,119
sized trees just cut them down clearcut

1068
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:36,639
them uh no thought to drainage

1069
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,760
or uh no respect for the environment

1070
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,199
whatsoever to be the hippie yeah well I

1071
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,119
was told it was a mess out there I knew

1072
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,919
one of the uh not to blow too many

1073
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,640
[ __ ] whistles but I know a friend of

1074
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,880
mine's father is a retired cop and he's

1075
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,679
cool as [ __ ] uh my buddy's a dab head

1076
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,599
and Dab's sitting on the couch next to

1077
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,838
his dad who was a cop at the time uh he

1078
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
was telling us that there were plants

1079
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:02,639
out there of all stages yes uh 8 in tall

1080
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,920
12 in tall 3T tall and he said there

1081
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,920
were bags of buds and a manicuring

1082
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,639
station and I was tripping out because

1083
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,200
when this place was discovered was not

1084
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,920
flowering season it was uh it was like

1085
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:16,480
spring or some [ __ ] and he was saying

1086
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,800
that they already had plants 6' tall 3T

1087
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,039
tall with big buds on them in flower and

1088
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,560
there's no way that they could have set

1089
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,559
up like a or a light dep out there on

1090
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,000
Seven Acres I mean without being busted

1091
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,838
they were using Autoflower plants which

1092
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,239
uh that's the best use of autof flowers

1093
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,199
I could ever see so if you're trying to

1094
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,479
do some crazy outdoor where you've got

1095
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,118
enough time before the cold come right

1096
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,719
after the cold get those in the ground

1097
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,559
you might be able to pull off an outdoor

1098
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,799
crop probably so um they I mean they

1099
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:47,239
were living up there uh they had quite

1100
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,240
the little city and I may may have found

1101
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,759
a

1102
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,838
plant and may have moved it down just to

1103
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,560
see what happened and uh yeah it was

1104
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:56,880
totally an autof flower so could there

1105
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,400
have been any seeds up there by chance

1106
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,800
um probably so uh the plant I found was

1107
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,358
actually a male autoflowering plant

1108
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,000
which is yeah I killed it burned it

1109
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:10,078
stomped it into the ground um yeah [ __ ]

1110
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,920
a male Autoflower plant yeah that's

1111
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,839
super super

1112
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,119
dangerous yeah so this is just going to

1113
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,559
bust in your room one day Spencer's

1114
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,480
eyeballs are about to pop out of his

1115
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,199
head yeah how do you feel when you find

1116
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,880
a male in the grow room about 3 weeks

1117
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,879
into

1118
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,119
flower um it's only happened like once

1119
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,358
and I don't know it's probably one of

1120
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,559
the sad not saddest days but I can

1121
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:37,559
compare it to the feeling of when a

1122
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,639
condom breaks yeah it's like you walk in

1123
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:43,279
the room and you cuz you can tell once

1124
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:47,400
it's like that far in if you can't tell

1125
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,119
something's wrong um it's just and it's

1126
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,039
kind of heartbreaking cuz at that point

1127
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,519
you don't know like you don't know what

1128
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,279
it hit if it hit if it's dropping pollen

1129
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,880
is it not dropping there's just too many

1130
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,800
questions going on so and when you find

1131
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,079
some seeds in your nugs you know a month

1132
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,480
and a or 3 months later it's like well

1133
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,880
damn there it goes there's the results

1134
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,199
yep saw it Go oops so guys pay attention

1135
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,200
for the males that room that plant in

1136
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,078
the back yeah if you see a a yellow dust

1137
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,000
on your

1138
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,960
Leaf that's I discovered a mill One Time

1139
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,358
by that oops look at that what oh

1140
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,838
[ __ ] those nanners just erupted yeah be

1141
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:27,880
careful uh keep an eye on your femini

1142
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:31,480
seeds too because fem seeds can turn

1143
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,800
into hermaphrodites or males um I hope

1144
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,679
we actually covered something we got

1145
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
dabbed as [ __ ] on this episode talking

1146
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,480
about this so I hope we made some sort

1147
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,559
of sense I want to stress my point again

1148
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,960
growing from seeds is awesome everything

1149
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:46,078
came from seed yeah that's uh if you

1150
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,039
grow for the Curiosity and just the love

1151
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,480
of the plant and you've never grown from

1152
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:54,119
seed well I question your curiosity then

1153
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,199
well if you grow from seed I grow from

1154
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,358
seed cuz it there's a possibility of

1155
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:00,199
finding something that people people

1156
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,000
don't have and that's my that's my

1157
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:03,439
answer for you right there like yeah I

1158
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
would literally I'll grow a pack of

1159
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,358
seeds to find a feno that you know maybe

1160
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,400
two people out of what couple hundred

1161
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,318
people that have boughten packs have you

1162
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,119
know yep who knows one day that strength

1163
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:17,279
could be you know everything you wanted

1164
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,720
it to and I've seen seeds uh I forget

1165
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,079
the term for it but I have bred seeds

1166
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:25,439
that the outcome has been better than

1167
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,359
both parents like it got more Vigor and

1168
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,400
more tricomes than the two parents I

1169
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:33,000
used and I upgraded yeah like so that's

1170
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,599
a good good way to look at it you got

1171
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,039
something in your brain there yeah I

1172
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,960
know that term I just I can't I think DJ

1173
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,159
Short might have recently said it yeah

1174
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,920
yeah somebody said it yeah I actually

1175
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,519
looked it up when he said it cuz

1176
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,318
