00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,060
we've covered all of the business part

72
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,439
here at the start of the podcast I do

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,420
have something I kind of want to segue

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,000
into I'm not sure if you pay attention

75
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,699
to the news but recently A man was

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,939
executed in Singapore for possession of

77
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,878
2.2 pounds of cannabis that's right A

78
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,259
man was executed for cannabis I don't

79
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,000
believe that that is right I don't

80
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,159
believe that that is fair I think that

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,318
that is wrong I think that's terrible uh

82
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,239
being somebody who promotes Advocates

83
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,159
supports and thoroughly enjoys cannabis

84
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,259
this is [ __ ] heartbreaking to hear

85
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,598
that somebody was put to death for

86
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,878
possession of an herb that causes no

87
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,378
harm in my opinion or experience and

88
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,179
makes people feel better in a

89
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,340
recreational and a medical way this

90
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,739
person is gone they had children they

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,360
had a family and this person is gone the

92
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,280
government in their country decided that

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,220
they needed to kill this person for

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,598
cannabis that is [ __ ] crazy to me now

95
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,919
another thing I want to add to this and

96
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,899
you'll see how they connect in just a

97
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,339
moment is I was talking to a friend who

98
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,379
was recently traveling around the world

99
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,239
and they went to Australia and they

100
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,799
found themselves in Australia smoking a

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,658
little bit of pot in front of a bar

102
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,280
somebody walked up to them and said hey

103
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:42,840
mate I'm not sure they said hey mate but

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,580
they're Australian so they probably did

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,319
they said hey mate you can't smoke that

106
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,879
the cops are already on the way looking

107
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,158
for you they smelled it down the street

108
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,079
and my friend said you can't just smoke

109
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,798
a joint in front of a bar here and they

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,480
said no you will go straight to jail for

111
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,099
having cannabis with you here so you've

112
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,658
got to get rid of that you've got to

113
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,340
hide you've got to get rid of the smell

114
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:03,239
so my friend had to get rid of his

115
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,860
cannabis he had to get rid of the

116
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,420
Cannabis he was smoking he had to get

117
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,099
rid of his stash and his success series

118
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,359
he had to go somewhere make sure he

119
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,399
didn't smell like cannabis because they

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
were looking for this person where I am

121
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,360
headed with this you guys

122
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm here in Colorado my friend was from

123
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Colorado uh don't forget sometimes that

124
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,280
it is not all Colorado it is not safe to

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,139
travel everywhere with cannabis it is

126
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,119
not safe to consume cannabis openly

127
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,500
everywhere you've got to keep your heads

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,540
up you've got to learn about the rules

129
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,699
the laws the regulations before you go

130
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,259
somewhere and find out what type of risk

131
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,780
you're putting yourself in if you do

132
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,300
travel with cannabis or consume or

133
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,219
acquire cannabis in a foreign or Strange

134
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,960
Land it could be a different state if

135
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to a different state I do

136
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,918
research before I go there can I take

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,300
cannabis what happens if I do take

138
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,219
cannabis what happens if I take

139
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,780
concentrates what kind of trouble am I

140
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,220
going to get into if I get caught with a

141
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,019
couple of joints what kind of trouble do

142
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,880
I get into if I get caught with a couple

143
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,039
grams of cannabis what kind of trouble

144
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,019
do I get into for traveling with it I do

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,819
all of that research if I'm going to a

146
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,740
state next to me a few States over if

147
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,959
I'm flying somewhere I think about all

148
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,819
of that stuff before I travel do extra

149
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,560
research on that if you are traveling

150
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,180
abroad going to another country with

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
different laws rules and regulations

152
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,500
whatever you you think works here may

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,879
not work there things are different in

154
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,860
other countries and once you're in their

155
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,959
country you are under their laws you've

156
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,879
got to follow their laws you may be a

157
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,198
privileged person here you may not fit a

158
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,939
certain criteria here where you're going

159
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,919
to get searched and hassled in another

160
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,079
country you're probably exactly who

161
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:32,579
they're going to search and hassle so my

162
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,319
point of this is somebody has been

163
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,659
executed for cannabis in another country

164
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,759
a person I know was almost arrested and

165
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,380
given a really hard time for consuming

166
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,180
cannabis just a little tiny bit of

167
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,219
cannabis outside of a bar in Australia

168
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,319
my point here is be very careful you

169
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,940
guys I don't want you to get put in a

170
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,740
foreign jail where we'll never hear from

171
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,360
you again dude they're going to feed you

172
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,280
terrible food and treat you like [ __ ]

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
forever because you're An American in a

174
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,758
foreign prison in a foreign jail good

175
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,038
luck with that and I definitely don't

176
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,720
want you executed for enjoying our

177
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,519
favorite plant don't be a statistic in

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,860
another country I know it's fun to smoke

179
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,019
it's fun to get high and enter at your

180
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,300
own risk but I'm saying understand the

181
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,159
risk and be as careful as possible all

182
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,780
right that's enough of the news talk I

183
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,180
wanted to cover today let's segue into

184
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,579
the cannabis cultivation and cannabis

185
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,959
questions portion of this podcast I do

186
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,879
have a lot of great questions that I do

187
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,038
want to answer this question that I'm

188
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,978
about to read did come from did come

189
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,939
from the grow help tab on

190
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:28,818
iregenetics.com that was harder to say

191
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,139
than it looked if you go to

192
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,240
iregenetics.com there's a row of tabs on

193
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,918
the top one of them says questions or

194
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,019
grow help if you click on that tab

195
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,639
you'll be given the opportunity to fill

196
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,439
it to fill out a questionnaire asking

197
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,360
about your garden then at the end you

198
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,560
are given the opportunity to ask a grow

199
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,840
question

200
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,000
this grow question came from our friend

201
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,258
Paulie two fingers said what kind of

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,538
question do you have it is a general

203
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,120
grow question the question from Polly

204
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,159
two fingers goes a lot like this it says

205
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,139
what's up Ross to Jeff what's up Polly

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,939
good to meet you bro it says I love your

207
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,100
podcast thank you Brooks I love you too

208
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,019
it says seriously it is one of the best

209
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,180
for real knowledge I appreciate that

210
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,399
thank you it says not just Bro Science

211
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,079
some of it is Bro Science but it's also

212
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,000
I've got a lot of experience so I feel

213
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,859
like I can talk from experience I read a

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,660
lot and then there is some Bro Science

215
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,520
mixed in it says it's actually quite

216
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,919
quality info thank you brother I do

217
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,959
appreciate that I try hard to give you

218
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,879
real reliable accurate info I feel like

219
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,739
you guys are gonna use the advice that I

220
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,019
give you in your garden and I would feel

221
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,460
like a real uh a terrible person if you

222
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,079
messed up your garden based on the

223
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,939
advice that I give you

224
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,519
um I'm I try to be better than that so

225
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,319
it goes on it says my question is this

226
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,159
this is a really good question here also

227
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,960
why why oh why does my pH drift in my

228
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,400
reservoir that's a really good very

229
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,560
common question and I've got a good

230
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,299
logical explanation but let's go a

231
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
little further I did say explanation on

232
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,199
purpose just so you know you're paying

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,840
attention oh it says I've heard it will

234
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,840
go down if there is a bacteria but mine

235
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,818
wants to rise slowly as days go by I'm

236
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,459
using fluorflex nutrients they are salt

237
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,080
based and I run a sterile system they

238
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,060
claim their nutrients are stable for

239
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,519
weeks I'm just curious if you have any

240
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,439
good info on this issue I've not heard

241
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,258
anyone tackle this issue and I feel like

242
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,180
this pH drifting will affect my final

243
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,800
product it will it goes on it says I'm

244
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,079
looking at getting a blue lab pH

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
controller with the pump to keep it

246
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,240
dialed in any help is greatly

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,879
appreciated from your friend Polly to

248
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,439
fingers Polly I've got a really great

249
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,360
really logical really rational

250
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,458
explanation for what I think is

251
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,038
happening here in your grow why your pH

252
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,718
is rising this could be a reservoir for

253
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,278
Hydroponics this could be a reservoir

254
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
for an auto watering system it could be

255
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,759
an Evan ebb and flow table it could be a

256
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,259
drain to waste table I don't know

257
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,659
exactly what you've got set up but I

258
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,519
imagine a large Reservoir

259
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:50,579
um and from that Reservoir water will be

260
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,860
pumped out of that into your plants

261
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,660
um over time there will be evaporation

262
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,580
right the water the water is going to

263
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,159
evaporate from that vessel from your

264
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,320
Reservoir so the water level is going to

265
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,539
go down but as that water evaporates

266
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,120
guess what happens the salts from your

267
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,679
bottled nutrients do not evaporate so

268
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,659
they're becoming more concentrated

269
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,479
you'll also notice if you measure the pH

270
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,939
or the EC it is probably slightly Rising

271
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,500
as well because water has evaporated and

272
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,000
none of the salts that you have added to

273
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,039
that water are leaving they're solids

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
they're not leaving so the water is up

275
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,399
in the air now it's up in there is vapor

276
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,560
it's becoming clouds it's becoming rain

277
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,879
it's becoming humidity it's a problem in

278
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,518
the grow maybe it sucked right back up

279
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,899
into the dehumidifier but those

280
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
nutrients are still right there in your

281
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,220
Reservoir so you've got less water they

282
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,419
might be very minute difference amount

283
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,100
of water but it can make a big

284
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,899
difference in the pH in the EC so you

285
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,759
got a little bit less water and you

286
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,200
haven't reduced the amount of salts so

287
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,838
that's going to make the EC go up and

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,220
the the pH are going up because it

289
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
doesn't seem like you're losing a lot of

290
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,220
water but over a couple of days you're

291
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,778
probably evaporating a little bit of

292
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,940
water especially if you've got bubbles

293
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,679
in there because the bubbles are adding

294
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,779
a lot of oxygen to that and putting the

295
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,479
uh the water into the air and giving it

296
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,939
more opportunity to become a vapor and

297
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,259
humidity into the room so what I really

298
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,060
think is happening here is just the

299
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,740
water is evaporating it's making your pH

300
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,719
rise because there's still salts

301
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,700
remaining there's less water the ratio

302
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,160
has changed that's throwing off your pH

303
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,560
the way to fix that is just keep monitor

304
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,539
monitoring that pH and if it gets lower

305
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,639
out of your range add a little bit of

306
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,219
water and that water should bring the PH

307
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,899
down right where you wanted it you may

308
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,180
need to add a little bit of pH Down that

309
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,820
may also be the solution maybe consider

310
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,559
checking the EC or the ppms while you're

311
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,080
doing this they may need to be adjusted

312
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,399
as well all right my friend Polly two

313
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,778

head reckon head tripping Buzz uh if I

370
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,259
if I can walk into Target and not have a

371
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,299
panic attack I did not get high enough

372
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,159
before we went into Target I need to go

373
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,019
take a couple of more dabs but let's

374
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,778
stay focused which is hard for me today

375
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,759
it says I'm just curious what are your

376
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,578
thoughts on Predator bugs versus

377
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,100
chemical or organic sprays for when

378
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:49,679
pests show up possibly indoors I haven't

379
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,060
ran into pests yet but it's best to be

380
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,859
prepared yes because now that you've

381
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,699
said you have not ran into pests guess

382
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,100
what

383
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,120
they're coming you've invited them by

384
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,560
saying that

385
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,600
goes on it says I would love to hear

386
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,518
this on an episode of the podcast well

387
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,860
here you go bro it is on the podcast it

388
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,259
is happening bro uh it wraps it up with

389
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,579
thank you so much my buddy Dave Skylark

390
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,399
thank you so much for the great question

391
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,739
this is a very good question uh how do I

392
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,278
feel about Predator bugs versus chemical

393
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,620
or organic sprays uh indoors I actually

394
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,259
use a combination of sprayed pesticide

395
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,179
applications and Predator insects in a

396
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,519
commercial grow environment I don't do

397
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,739
it as much in a personal grow because

398
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,360
there's not as much uh as much at stake

399
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,639
in a personal grow in a in a commercial

400
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,980
grow there are millions of dollars at

401
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,079
risk at stake per Harvest and a personal

402
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,820
grow it's not as much and the the

403
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,559
Predator bugs get a little bit expensive

404
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,360
the budget is better for the commercial

405
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,159
grow it's more worth it more worthwhile

406
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,259
let me delve into what I'm talking about

407
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,299
here in a commercial grow I like to

408
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:51,539
start with spray applications just basic

409
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,559
sprays uh evergreen or um what's the

410
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,819
other one that I like to use in the

411
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,219
commercial girl evergreen's my favorite

412
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,839
go-to most of the time for preventative

413
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,120
I probably talk about that that one a

414
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,040
lot azitrol I think is still allowed in

415
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,600
the commercial girl environment venerate

416
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,759
is still allowed I like to use products

417
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,159
like that as just a basic and a rotation

418
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,539
for my basic integrated Pest management

419
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,458
system and we're going to talk a lot

420
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,838
about Pest Management and another future

421
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,299
episode I'm going to do a full episode

422
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,160
about it but I like to spray those

423
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,139
products through veg I like to spray

424
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,759
those products right at the beginning of

425
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,100
flower but as soon as I have flower

426
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,778
formations I don't want to apply any

427
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,120
more sprayed pesticides I don't want to

428
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,620
mess up the flowers in any way I don't

429
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
want to slow down their growth I don't

430
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,220
want to mess up the flavor I don't want

431
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,720
to do any damage to those flowers once

432
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,120
they start developing I just want big

433
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,100
fat healthy flower clusters so I need

434
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,379
some way to stop bugs from attacking

435
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,360
that grow once I stop using those spray

436
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,799
applications because some of the grows

437
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,139
that I work with in the Colorado area

438
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,879
they're in the middle of basically the

439
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,680
middle of the desert and there are bugs

440
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,958
out there and there are bushes out there

441
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,458
and we can't we can only do so much to

442
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,979
the outside environment and the building

443
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,778
is only so sealed so bugs are able to

444
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,579
get in so I've got to do do things to

445
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,559
make sure they cannot get to my plants

446
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,179
so once I have hit the threshold that I

447
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,518
feel like my plants are too beefy and

448
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,859
too chunky to apply a spray pesticide

449
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,740
that is when I begin to release large

450
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,899
batches of predator and sex there's a

451
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,220
very large variety of Predator insects

452
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,339
you can release in a cultivation

453
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,920
facility to eliminate bugs eradicate

454
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,380
bugs keep bugs at Bay you can get rid of

455
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,179
almost any insect with other insects you

456
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,759
just may have to be aggressive about it

457
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,099
it's all about a numbers game also just

458
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,500
like pesticides it's just as important

459
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,360
when I use a pesticide my first question

460
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,759
is what bugs are we trying to attack

461
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,720
what pest is coming what am I spraying

462
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,159
for because if you're fighting guys with

463
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,660
AK-47s you don't want to send in karate

464
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,458
guys that's not going to work you've got

465
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,198
to send in guys with [ __ ] missile

466
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,638
launchers to take them out you've got to

467
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,519
know what you're battling so that you

468
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,740
can win the same thing applies for

469
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,720
attacking a pest problem with another

470
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,159
pest you need the appropriate pest so

471
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,278
you have to do your research on that

472
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,980
part also so it is very environmental

473
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,480
and regionally dependent some past some

474
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,278
of your Predator bugs will not stick

475
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,440
around if your humidity is too high or

476
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,939
too low some of the Predators will not

477
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,740
stick around if the temperature is too

478
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,720
high or too low so you've got to find

479
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,820
the bugs that work for your environment

480
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,100
and attack the pest you are trying to

481
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,600
eradicate now to some people it may

482
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,000
sound crazy that I'm going to apply

483
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,040
sprays and then release bugs but I'm

484
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,620
going to time it properly I'm going to

485
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
spray all the way up to about day 10 of

486
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,440
flour and then I'm going to stop

487
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,600
spraying then we're going to do a heavy

488
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,459
defoliation one last time and we're

489
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,100
going to order the insects the bugs will

490
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,379
show up about day 14 or 15 then we'll

491
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,420
release all of those bugs by this time

492
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,399
all the sprayed pesticide applications

493
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,439
have broken down they've been broken

494
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,240
down by the Light by the wind and they

495
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,940
are no longer going to be a problem for

496
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,519
the incoming Predator bugs so I will

497
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,500
spray all through veg once or twice a

498
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,360
week if I see I spray once a week no

499
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,278
matter what and if I see a problem we

500
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,379
step it up we spray twice a week if I

501
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,939
still see problem then I really need to

502
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,860
step my [ __ ] up because I am failing

503
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,899
twice a week should get the job done no

504
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,578
matter what bugs I'm facing then I will

505
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,740
taper off the sprays if I don't see any

506
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,619
problems as we go into flour taper off

507
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,359
the sprays do another defoliation and

508
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,219
release the Predator bugs those bugs are

509
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,539
going to work like an army like security

510
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,400
guards they're going to get in there

511
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,019
hungry when they come in the mail they

512
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,179
are hungry bro when those bugs show up

513
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,740
they are ready to [ __ ] go so release

514
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,600
those strategically spread them out

515
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,980
through the canopy if you've got a hot

516
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,958
spot of bugs you're trying to get rid of

517
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,819
focus some of your bugs on that hot spot

518
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,200
and get rid of those bugs they will come

519
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,178
in they will start eating the [ __ ] out

520
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,038
of the bad guys they will take over they

521
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,720
will colonize and then once all of your

522
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,339
pests are gone basically all of your

523
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
good bugs will die too if they don't

524
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,720
have a food source you can feed them if

525
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,759
you like or you can let them dwindle off

526
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,679
and die a lot of times if we have extra

527
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,538
bugs from the flower rooms I will go put

528
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,980
some of those in the mom room because I

529
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:51,538
do believe that the mother room is where

530
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,640
it all starts if you don't have healthy

531
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,558
moms you can't have healthy clothes then

532
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,600
you can't have healthy veg you'll never

533
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,220
have healthy flour so I'll go spread

534
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,379
some of those in the mom room just to

535
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,819
give that Mom room a little bonus get

536
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,840
some Predator bugs in there and that way

537
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,819
they're already started they're

538
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,319
colonizing in there and we can move them

539
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,700
around yes perhaps a lot of them are

540
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,859
going to get destroyed by pesticide

541
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,298
applications in the future but they're

542
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:14,639
like little backup Guardians for the

543
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,918
time that they do survive all right my

544
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,840
friend Dave Skylark thank you for the

545
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,400
great question I do appreciate it my

546
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,259
method use those sprayed applications

547
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
right up till the last minute then

548
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,798
switch to those bugs if you do want to

549
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,140
use bugs the whole way let me talk about

550
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,240
that you definitely can use predator

551
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,340
bugs the entire time through the grow

552
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,798
side through the growth cycle if you

553
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,720
don't want to add spray applications and

554
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,240
there are some spray applications that

555
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,860
will not harm beneficial insects they'll

556
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,538
keep some of your uh your beneficial

557
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,519
Predator bugs around you do need to do

558
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,279
the research on that if you're going to

559
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,660
spray something read will it kill

560
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,639
hypoaspy Smiles will it kill Green Lace

561
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,440
Wings see because some of your

562
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,179
applications are only going to kill the

563
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,558
insects that bite into the leaf and some

564
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,780
of these guys don't bite into the leaf

565
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,339
they just crawl around on it so you may

566
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,558
be able to spray some applications even

567
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,759
after you do release the Predators once

568
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,160
again you'll have to do your research

569
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,859
for specific predators and specific

570
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,600
sprays but you definitely can use the

571
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,359
Predator bugs through the entire

572
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,099
duration of the grow once again I will

573
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,479
list off some more because I think I

574
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,000
went through them quite quickly a moment

575
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,419
ago there is the California kiss or the

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,460
Swarovski the hypoaspis miles the Green

577
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,020
Lace wings

578
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,579
um there's another one that I just

579
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,440
cannot think of right now that is

580
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,418
voracious

581
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,220
um yeah the minute pirate bug is

582
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,440
definitely a hungry little bastard I

583
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,000
like the green lacewing eggs they come

584
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,740
on little cards they hatch and they turn

585
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,900
into these little uh it looks like a

586
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,400
little microscopic crocodile those guys

587
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,019
are hungry as [ __ ] they will eat the

588
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,480
[ __ ] out of all of the bugs in your

589
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,160
garden I recommend not to waste your

590
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,419
time with ladybugs a lot of people are

591
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,240
going to say just buy ladybugs and

592
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,980
release those nah bro ladybugs are

593
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,538
[ __ ] lazy compared to more aggressive

594
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,798
bugs there are much more aggressive

595
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,019
Predators out there if you're going to

596
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,538
pay money you want to get the good get

597
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,900
the aggressive bugs the bugs I mentioned

598
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,058
before and also ladybugs for every

599
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,340
thousand ladybugs you release I think

600
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,139
500 of them fly into the lights into the

601
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,119
ducting into the blowers and get they're

602
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,038
suicidal they Kamikaze themselves right

603
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,538
the [ __ ] away the ladybugs are really

604
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,220
cool for about 30 minutes you get them

605
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,259
in there take a bunch of photos oh

606
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,700
ladybugs cool they're everywhere and

607
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,619
then the next day it smells like [ __ ]

608
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,640
because they stink so bad you walk into

609
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,079
the grill and it sounds like you're

610
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,520
walking on crunchy popcorn because

611
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,259
there's dead ladybugs on the floor and

612
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,579
they're just you're just busting them I

613
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,798
don't like the ladybugs I think I made

614
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,079
my point on that I'm Ross to Jeff and I

615
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,639
vote no on ladybugs and the grow use a

616
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,379
more aggressive Predator that's my

617
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,240
stance on [ __ ] all right where are we on

618
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,700
time I think we've got time for one more

619
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,220

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,440
are powdery mildew resistant that is a

633
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,019
really good question a lot of people are

634
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,940
going to be growing Outdoors this year a

635
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,038
lot of people on the coastal areas are

636
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,019
always looking for that mold and mildew

637
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,640
resistant strain a lot of people have

638
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,200
been asking me this lately because they

639
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,299
are going outdoors I have got some

640
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,580
recommendations for you have no fear

641
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,259
roster Jeff has got answers one of the

642
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,298
strains I can recommend to you that has

643
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,400
been proven to be very resistant to

644
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,980
powdery mildew in indoor and outdoor

645
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
environments is Morning Dew Morning Dew

646
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,120
is one of my favorite strains that is a

647
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,798
Grateful Dog pollinated by an arise

648
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,359
plant I made both of those plants and

649
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,759
then I bred them together so that is one

650
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,399
of my favorite Creations the morning do

651
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,158
makes a kind of a skunky chemically

652
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,840
cushy sort of Aromas and flavors with a

653
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,600
really nice Buzz so that one is Morning

654
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,819
Dew that one is going to be very powdery

655
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,399
mildew resistant the next one is

656
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,379
character Zero character Zero is an

657
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,019
Afterglow cross a lot of the Afterglow

658
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,440
crosses that I made um about a year ago

659
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:08,819
those crosses are all very powdery

660
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,279
mildew resistant but some of the

661
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:13,200
standout crosses in that lineup were the

662
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,658
character Zero and the Sunday show those

663
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,360
are both very powdery mildew resistant

664
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,740
those both have a very specific very

665
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,099
special plant in there which is a

666
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,839
Nigerian cross two and Afghani cross to

667
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,459
a Nepali while I'm surprised and glad

668
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,839
that I remembered all of that and

669
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,880
everything that comes from that plant

670
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,119
that is crossed to that plant does make

671
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,000
very powdery mildew resistant plants so

672
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,798
that plant was crossed to the Afterglow

673
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,419
that CR that plant was also crossed to

674
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,700
the Fire OG and then crossed to the

675
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,759
Afterglow both of those Offspring create

676
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,679
very powdery mildew resistant plants and

677
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,019
once again those are the character Zero

678
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,038
and Sunday show I've got one more for

679
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,779
you that we're going to talk about here

680
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,240
that is very powdery mildew resistant

681
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,119
and that one is called fist bomb fist

682
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,640
bump is sour diesel to arise

683
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,519
that one is super stinky it's got a

684
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,860
super Sour Diesel chemical Dirty Feet

685
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,480
sort of a funky thing to it and the buzz

686
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,399
on it is amazing it'll make your eyes

687
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,538
nice and heavy make you nice and

688
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,120
red-eyed give you that old school

689
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,879
cottonmouth and the flavor is just right

690
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,279
so some options for powdery mildew

691
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,799
resistant strains from my lineup I would

692
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,859
say Morning Dew Morning Dew is regular

693
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,200
seeds by the way male female seeds uh

694
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,759
the character Zero and Sunday show are

695
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,500
two more recommendations those are

696
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,779
feminized seeds and my final

697
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,659
recommendation for you was fist bump and

698
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,460
