110
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,729
coalition I realized the other day that

111
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,500
there are a lot of people out there

112
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,659
let's say I have a question about

113
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,310
cannabis ask Rasta Jeff so just thanks

114
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,199
for believing in me and trusting me to

115
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,850
guide you through your garden all right

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,939
I think that's enough rambling for the

117
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,070
start of the podcast Jesse's here and he

118
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,399
wanted to talk about composting he sent

119
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,740
me a message and he

120
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,870
I have had composting on my head all day

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,220
and I said I don't think compost is

122
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,478
quite what's in your head but it's close

123
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,810
so here we are we're gonna talk a little

124
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:39,769
bit about composting yeah where do you

125
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,069
want to start bro do you want to jump

126
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:47,538
right into it with anything okay well

127
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:51,579
the first note that I took was buh Kashi

128
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:55,668
yeah yeah so okay let's do it that way

129
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:59,300
so buh Kashi is for anyone that's not

130
00:04:55,668 --> 00:05:02,839
familiar it is a grain that has been

131
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:09,829
inoculated with an e/m one culture an

132
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:13,719
endogenous microorganism yes yes yeah I

133
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:17,509
think they spray like a barley okay

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,060
possibly a dairy product that's how you

135
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:23,360
end up with the em1 okay fermented milk

136
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,780
okay so you take a culture you collect

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,598
and you mix it with milk and it uh it

138
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:33,138
ferments and that's how you end up with

139
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:35,959
what they call labs lactic acid bacteria

140
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,949
correct okay and from that you can turn

141
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:43,000
that into em1 and you can take the em1

142
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:46,550
inoculate your grain fermented it again

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,879
let it dry out and boom you've got both

144
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,110
Kashi great okay so are you making the

145
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,469
Bokashi are you buying the Bokashi

146
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,189
pre-made I'm getting the bow Kashi right

147
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,229
now from Victor with innovative organics

148
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:04,158
up in Denver okay

149
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:07,728
it's really good and it's pretty damn

150
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:13,189
cheap so and he's a small local business

151
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:16,189
that is that's taken food out of the

152
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:19,009
look you know landfills oh isn't it very

153
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,300
good so it's so let's teach the people

154
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,649
about the Bokashi bucket a little bit

155
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,030
then since you said taking food out of

156
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,189
the landfills that's gonna make people

157
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,689
have a lot of questions I've got a book

158
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,430
coffee bucket I can see one from where

159
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,620
we're sitting so it'll be advantageous

160
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,620
to describe it it's basically a five

161
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,699
gallon bucket with a spigot on it

162
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,490
there's a little collection tray in the

163
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,110
bottom that prevents the solid particles

164
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,889
from getting in the way of the spicket

165
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,420
and basically I fill that thing with my

166
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,069
vegetable scraps I don't need any meat

167
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,230
products so all my vegetable scraps the

168
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,060
tips of my carrots the ends of my

169
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,129
avocados the avocado pits go in there

170
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,810
and they disintegrate completely stuff

171
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,339
that goes to waste

172
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,839
yeah anything I would throw away it's

173
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,429
sitting near the trash can to encourage

174
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,500
me instead of putting in the trash it

175
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,600
goes in the Kashi bucket I fill it up I

176
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,670
fill up a bowl like a glass bowl and

177
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,689
then I dump that glass bowl into the bow

178
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,100
Kashi bucket because it's much easier

179
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,850
that way and I don't have to open it as

180
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,110
frequently because it smell so you've

181
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,300
got a five-gallon bucket with a lid that

182
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,090
seals on it it's gonna speak it I

183
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,160
usually put a little late a thin layer

184
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,019
of newspaper in there just to prevent a

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,700
good idea yeah cuz some of that particle

186
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,879
stuff will clog up the drain thing there

187
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,319
so you put put the paper down and then

188
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,850
you I just put like a couple banana

189
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,899
peels I honestly in there to get started

190
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,730
so you two [ __ ] ton of I used to eat a

191
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,899
[ __ ] ton of bananas two banana peels in

192
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,240
there to get it started than a handful

193
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,699
of the Bokashi grain because that is a

194
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,960
bio activator and then you just start

195
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,939
throwing your all your scrap in there

196
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,949
and then once you get a nice layer maybe

197
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,420
an inch or two thick then just put a

198
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,879
little another handful of that Bokashi

199
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,090
grain on there and repeat just make a

200
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,540
lasagna basically of scraps Kashi scraps

201
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,069
Kashi

202
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,950
I think it's an inch and a half that

203
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,139
they say okay I put in yeah so every

204
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,060
inch and a half throw in more Bowl Kashi

205
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,099
great and don't press it down you guys

206
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,629
cuz it's going to expand in there no you

207
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,300
do what a press you do want to press it

208
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,670
down yes okay

209
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,069
yeah all right so uh most PO Kashi

210
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,660
buckets come with a little longer masher

211
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,730
thing oh it's when you push it down that

212
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,980
it farts and makes a horrific smell yes

213
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:21,319
correct okay he's also you could squeeze

214
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,300
a [ __ ] ona of chili delete juice yeah

215
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,139
have you ever tried to clean a drain

216
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,180
with that juice

217
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,829
I actually just tried it the other day

218
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,459
Dave's work for you know but it's pretty

219
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:32,720
[ __ ] close okay I poured I even made

220
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:38,090
sure I had enough

221
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,100
I poured oh wow one client that's like a

222
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,690
hair clog that would have done it you

223
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:47,570
got something serious in there would you

224
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:49,460
eat boy all right so then you pack it

225
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,490
down and then you seal it up and just

226
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,680
leave it in there and then

227
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,960
after about ten or twelve days it'll

228
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,339
start making juice and you can open up

229
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,290
the little spigot and I use a glass

230
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,000
mason jar to catch the juice and then I

231
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,559
seal it up and I cover it with honestly

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,549
with just a rag to keep it dark because

233
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,599
you want to keep that away from the

234
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:08,519
light and then I put about an ounce per

235
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,259
five gallon bucket when I go to mix up

236
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,210
some nutrients put about an ounce of

237
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,500
that crap in there and a five gallon

238
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,300
bucket with my newts and I can see the

239
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,789
plants start up taking oh yeah much

240
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,740
better and when I go ahead it's just

241
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,169
full of nutrients it's all the nutrients

242
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,200
from the plant right I mean it's just

243
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,419
that that's all I'm using now in my

244
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,640
growth that's amazing even at the big

245
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,490
grow we've started using it quite a bit

246
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,039
and it will save on trash yeah save on

247
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,980
nutrient money it's full of humic acids

248
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:42,029
fulvic acids lactic acids

249
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,560
it's got bacteria and fungi in it a lot

250
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,149
of the things that you probably forgot

251
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,359
about and that your bottled nutrient

252
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,129
company probably missed also speed up

253
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,750
the root zone speed up the metabolism of

254
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:53,250
your plants so this is just the Bokashi

255
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,049
bucket you can get that lactic acid

256
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,730
bacteria juice out of there so it'll

257
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,029
start growing this white funky foam

258
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,730
these big gross looking brainy bubbles

259
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,799
that is perfect you want that if that's

260
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,870
happening you did it perfectly keep that

261
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,909
going because once you've drained it a

262
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,110
few times you can drain it a lot of

263
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,730
times you can leave it going and keep

264
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,230
draining it mash it and drain it and

265
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,690
mash it it'll go for a long time but

266
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,240
eventually what I like to do after I've

267
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,690
harvested I'll take my old dirt and pour

268
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,850
it into a big like a big are like a feed

269
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,410
trough for horses I think pour all the

270
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,810
dirt into there then I'll pour that

271
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:30,089
Bokashi bucket into there all that funk

272
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,319
and mix it in and mix that in with my

273
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,120
dirt and cover it and put a little

274
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,790
moisture in there and then it spreads

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
and I feel like that stuff the whatever

276
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:40,199
I made in the Kashi bucket grows

277
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,120
throughout my soil it will just go stir

278
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,070
it occasionally and I'll try to do it

279
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll try to get to full Bokashi buckets

280
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,180
in there by the before I go start to

281
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,790
reuse it yeah

282
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,639
and the smell is intense we do you know

283
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:55,349
it kind of smells if you're indoors like

284
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,319
somebody threw up in the bar trashcan

285
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:03,839
after drinking all day it's sort of

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:06,080
rotten milk ice cream and then drink all

287
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,580
day then threw up in the bar trash can

288
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,470
that's what that's seriously it's bad

289
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,459
you can just drain a little Mike can't

290
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,410
be around it

291
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,549
white Mike it's on the podcast often he

292
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,289
can't he's like oh if you're gonna do

293
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,240
that I'm [ __ ] going home like you

294
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:24,539
won't even be here the guys at work

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,009
loved it when I the Bokashi people on

296
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,110
instagram actually there's actually a

297
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:31,049
company called Bokashi they use

298
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,669
55-gallon drums of the mixture and then

299
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,799
they use a forklift to lift it up and

300
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:38,129
dump it and I could just imagine what

301
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,919
that smells like just 55 gallons of dead

302
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:44,009
body Victor's doing the same thing never

303
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:48,449
with the innovative organics okay yeah

304
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:49,649
that's [ __ ] what was I gonna say oh when

305
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,839
you were talking about putting a lot of

306
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:55,769
banana peels in there so cool thing

307
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,660
about boat or doing this process is the

308
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,079
compost that the Bocage you will

309
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:05,250
eventually make the pulp itself and the

310
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,730
leachate from it are both they contained

311
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,370
the nutrients that the plants contained

312
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:15,480
and bananas for instance are super high

313
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:18,600
in potassium so if you want a custom

314
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,180
tune bo costs bo khosh e-juice I mean

315
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,920
you know look at the nutrients that are

316
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,699
in the plant if you filled that thing

317
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:29,939
with with bananas and banana pills i

318
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,089
guaranteed behind guarantee decays yep

319
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,560
yeah if you put berries that are darker

320
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,270
in colors we're gonna have a whole bunch

321
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,059
of like hue mix and stuff like that in

322
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:41,009
there I'll assume yeah okay

323
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,229
so you've got your book Oishi bucket you

324
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,860
got this whole fuzzy white mess of stuff

325
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,089
you've got jars of lactic acid bacteria

326
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,490
then you said your next thing that you

327
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,520
got going was your worm program let's

328
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:57,528
talk about your worms so I started with

329
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,659
100 forums back in the summer a

330
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:02,278
potential vendor brought them in and

331
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:07,289
just gave them to me it was like nice

332
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:10,350
nice red wigglers yeah a clerk shows 100

333
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,579
of them and like you know like let's go

334
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,459
on fishing yeah exactly

335
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,070
all right so I took it home and dumped

336
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:20,819
him in a smart pot full of food scraps

337
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,770
initially I put it just straight peat

338
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,550
moss in there because that's something

339
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:29,220
they eat and I also did I think some

340
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:30,240
newspaper then and I kept him through

341
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,028
the summer

342
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,220
I wasn't like real actively feeding him

343
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:39,689
or anything but now that winters came

344
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:43,139
around I took I think it's a 40 gallon

345
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,970
container and filled it with all the

346
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,850
worm or you know all this stuff

347
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,528
necessary for a good proper setup of

348
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:54,540
warm bedding and I've been dumping the

349
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:57,409
Bocage he pulled in there and they go

350
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:00,480
[ __ ] nuts for that [ __ ] but I've got

351
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:01,949
so I mean I'm just it's cool it's fun

352
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,500
making all my nutrients at home

353
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,810
basically we we tell us a little bit

354
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,950
about what's in your warm bedding yeah

355
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,869
so I use I got some used phone books or

356
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,190
well I think all phone books are used I

357
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,169
don't even know why the [ __ ] they still

358
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,560
make it's true just the waste of trees

359
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:24,979
yeah it's worth I shredded them up and a

360
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:28,379
bunch of newspapers I used wood chips I

361
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,209
have a comfrey plan at home so that's

362
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,309
indoors so went ahead and chopped all of

363
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,899
that oh guys like uh so they're gonna

364
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,699
turn that up for you turn that into

365
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,120
useable nutrients yeah which that's a

366
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,649
whole nother part of my little homestead

367
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,250
style cuddling with the comfrey that is

368
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:49,500
but uh I put some of that in there and

369
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,809
then a full bucket of bocaj she stuff

370
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,639
Wow they're gonna love all that and I

371
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,379
figured out it so the bow cause she

372
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,009
stinks like hell when it's in a open

373
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,689
warm bin

374
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:03,240
yes so this time I put a whole bunch of

375
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,150
wood thick layer wood chips on the top

376
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,639
and then a bunch of wet newspaper

377
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,459
trap it in there and the smell went I

378
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,259
can't smell it okay that's helpful yeah

379
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,910
in the winter like this it's cold you

380
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,830
guys it's probably 12 degrees here in

381
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:20,600
Colorado maybe lower I'm not I don't

382
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,600
want to cause my dad yeah it's been

383
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,259
tonight it's gonna get stupid cold in my

384
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,660
garage I'm guessing it's gonna be in the

385
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,029
teens would I be able to keep my 40

386
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:34,230
gallon worm life container in the garage

387
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:37,860
right now you know I don't really know

388
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:41,639
okay I have a similar situation but my

389
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,889
garage is heated I know it's around 65

390
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,929
degrees and they don't give it like do

391
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,879
it almost think I would assume that that

392
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,279
dirt is gonna be hot anyway cuz it's

393
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,649
bioactive in there yeah that's like the

394
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,829
the little warm farm I have most

395
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:58,769
definitely it creates its own heat it's

396
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:02,730
more established the big one I just set

397
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:07,319
that up last weekend so I'm sure it will

398
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:09,960
start waiting up I'm not gonna like just

399
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,910
say oh yeah you'll be fine so okay one

400
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,850
thing I would for sure do is lift it off

401
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:16,409
the floor okay so that's not that cold

402
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,259
your plants want to be off that cold

403
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:21,750
concrete really sucks for plants unless

404
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,029
it's a real fancy heated floor right

405
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,090
he gets so cold yeah so I'm cold so fast

406
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,879
it's a heat sink it actually stills heat

407
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,710
out of things that are sitting on it so

408
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,809
oh wow I never thought of that

409
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,450
yeah like when you're drunk anyway in

410
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:38,129
the bathtub to cool down yeah I have a

411
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,090
dimension so long but that was the first

412
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:43,710
first thing I could think of Wow

413
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,120
alright so you've got your Bo Kashi you

414
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,850
got your worms and you're using a big

415
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,429
forty gallon container how what else he

416
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,879
is going into your compost just kid

417
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:56,959
subscribes at this point once spring

418
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,789
comes around and it's not cold as [ __ ]

419
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,980
when I get my outdoor compost pile go

420
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:04,470
and I'll be putting all the chicken

421
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,860
bedding in there that's mixed with

422
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,370
chicken [ __ ] okay and do you put like me

423
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,789
products in there also no in a boat I

424
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:17,039
mean you can invoke Oishi but there they

425
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,450
say you can actually saw somebody the

426
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,078
Bokashi people put their entire

427
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,970
Thanksgiving dinner

428
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,519
their turkey like the carcass of the

429
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,720
uneaten turkey the mashed potatoes they

430
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,338
put the entire thing in there and then

431
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,079
they showed the process they and then

432
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,970
they took a the thing outside and dug a

433
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,089
hole and buried it and then they planted

434
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,019
a tree on top where they buried it so

435
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,639
it's claimed they could put meat in

436
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,089
there as well yeah this is longer

437
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,830
David's eight-foot feces in there things

438
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm not brave enough to do and things

439
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:48,490
I'm not gonna do for my indoor right if

440
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,528
I had a big huge gigantic outdoor garden

441
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,460
I that would be an end-of-the-world

442
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:56,740
scenario oh yeah yeah what even dairy

443
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,210
cheese and stuff like that they say you

444
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,490
can do and put eggshells in there - oh

445
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,389
yeah I told us I totally put it there

446
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,870
yeah coffee grounds even paper I mean

447
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:10,388
it's like coffee filters newspaper stuff

448
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:13,509
like okay so yeah it just eats that

449
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:16,599
right up disappears yeah you don't get a

450
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:20,259
lot of leachate off of it awesome I've

451
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:23,619
been putting all my cannabis scraps in

452
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:26,888
them so I've been when you've run them

453
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:28,599
through if I was to throw like the

454
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:31,719
leaves and stuff off my plants in the

455
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:37,538
garden into the open warm bin I would

456
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:40,690
lose most of the nitrogen and [ __ ] what

457
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:43,210
else and I would lose carbon through the

458
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,950
co2 that it emits as it dries out and

459
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,829
breaks down okay running them through

460
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,500
the PO Kashi bucket you retain all of

461
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:52,869
that Wow Oh Kansas permits at first and

462
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,119
it traps it in the plant so then it's

463
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:58,028
it's healthier food for the worms and it

464
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,668
makes a higher quality product richer

465
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:02,710
yeah much richer okay that fermentation

466
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,080
is what gives it that amazing smell

467
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,590
yeah that's Victor's been teaching me

468
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,210

469
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,720

475
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:25,638
nice if he's in Colorado yeah it's not a

476
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,009
huge where

477
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:29,958
full of [ __ ] boshy bucket so just go

478
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:34,069
sit on a bucket we all get a bucket is a

479
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:36,548
chair when you're a ganja grower this

480
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:39,979
smells kind of funky sometimes is it a

481
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:42,229
sickeningly satisfying thing like that

482
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:46,069
smells terrible I'll take five gallons

483
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:49,190
of it you know that that's gonna make

484
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:52,308
like fish hydro slates and like Bo Kashi

485
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,709
juice and remember Nirvana and piranhas

486
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:56,088
or what was it piranhas and tarantula

487
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,159
from advanced nutrients when they made

488
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:59,898
the liquids yeah oh those things smelled

489
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,669
like the women's bathroom at the park in

490
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:04,368
the middle of the summer it was so

491
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:05,959
terrible they worked you could feed your

492
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,328
plants very little of those things and

493
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:10,940
your plants would just go ape [ __ ]

494
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:12,469
I admit it back in the day I used all of

495
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,879
the advanced nutrients product I didn't

496
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:18,019
know any better that's what I've never

497
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:20,689
tried I just yeah not to bash anything

498
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:22,548
but that's one that I would avoid it did

499
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,739
they promise you that you'll get 30

500
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:26,868
percent heavier yields which it did it

501
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:28,429
gave me probably 30% fatter yields than

502
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:31,009
any other brand I've ever used

503
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,919
but all of my different strains looked

504
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:37,578
smelled and tasted the exact same yep

505
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,349
and they were all about I hypothetically

506
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:41,269
if all those strains hit 30 percent THC

507
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:43,278
with my regular regimen they all hit

508
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:45,528
about 2025 when I used advanced

509
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:47,450
nutrients but they were heavier you know

510
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:50,058
a lot more of it it just wasn't and I'd

511
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,369
rather have I'd rather to grow a pound

512
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,828
and a half of super day than two pounds

513
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:57,828
of me

514
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:59,959
they are extremely overpriced and I can

515
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:02,868
tell you that working with them as a

516
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:05,089
vendor and a company they are [ __ ]

517
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:06,558
nightmare every hydro shop and I've

518
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:08,358
tried to mess with has said that because

519
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,979
I would be like hey can you order this

520
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:11,088
new advanced nutrients product to people

521
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,828
just shake their heads to me like no

522
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:16,338
I'll take what they send me they send me

523
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:18,528
boxes of [ __ ] I sell that stuff oh yeah

524
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:21,319
you're placed in with psycho right yeah

525
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:23,028
I did a side by I've done a lot of side

526
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,398
by side this show just got off on a

527
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:27,648
wayside Trek I did not prefer psycho

528
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:29,388
either psycho gave me a lot of great

529
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:31,308
colors it gave me bud density and they

530
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,808
gave me weight but I did not approve of

531
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:34,338
the flavor the flavor was where it was

532
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:37,959
lacking everything tasted like grape

533
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,958
kool-aid that seems to be how

534
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:43,619
how all those multi-part lines right if

535
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,990
the bottles look like clear with

536
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,369
different dyes in them it's all probably

537
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,839
in my opinion I don't know this for sure

538
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,879
I should research this they probably all

539
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,019
come from one factory and they just get

540
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,370
poured into different bottles and get

541
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:57,359
different names put on them yeah

542
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:59,129
something or something similar I as a

543
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,689
rule of thumb when you're sure this is

544
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,180
just my opinion but as a rule of thumb

545
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,799
when you're shopping for a nutrient line

546
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,950
try to stick with an american-made

547
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:13,369
nutrient yeah those are by far the best

548
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:16,920
quality avoid Dutch nutrients of Dutch

549
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:19,649
growers grow a completely different way

550
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,380
than most Americans and the nutrients

551
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,660
are formulated differently and they

552
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,000
don't really work well with the way most

553
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,310
American growers grow I agree with most

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,960
of that I have seen some great results

555
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,339
though with a couple of those Dutch

556
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,019
brands might want mils if you follow

557
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:38,429
okay no be okay then I can think of

558
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,500
three brands that I would almost buy

559
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:46,519
their products if it came down to it I

560
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:54,690
mean housing garden is canna product

561
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:59,910
play draw a few people that are diehard

562
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:01,680
yeah we can get that yeah okay you're

563
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,590
right though about I've I've got a note

564
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,420
somewhere that says to talk about Dutch

565
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:09,480
the Dutch bred cannabis to be a [ __ ]

566
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,300
like because their grow rooms like the

567
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,250
way I see it cannabis happens on a Rocky

568
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:16,500
Mountain in Afghanistan where a goat

569
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,170
pissed on it the wind beat the [ __ ] out

570
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,910
of it the Sun beat down on it there's a

571
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,920
likelihood that a rock fell on it you

572
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:26,190
know what I mean on the side of the cush

573
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,230
Mountains in Afghanistan shopping still

574
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,539
super grumpy actually a rabbit lives

575
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:37,049
under it like it's covered in bugs [ __ ]

576
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:38,009
goes wrong thank you brain injury guys

577
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,799
sometimes I figure out the [ __ ] I'm

578
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:42,029
saying so then the Dutch the Dutch got a

579
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,769
hold of these plants like we want to

580
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,089
grow them indoors I have no idea what a

581
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,559
[ __ ] Dutch accent would sound like if

582
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,579
I tried to do it like we want a girlies

583
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,960
indoors they wanted to find the best

584
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:50,339
[ __ ] they bred it to be these really

585
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,160
skinny sticks that

586
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:57,539
really perfect buds now it's like roses

587
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:00,570
like tulips yep that's Dutch is all

588
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:03,389
about the flower industry yeah exactly

589
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,980
and over here in Colorado California the

590
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,470
states that are catching on we want to

591
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,819
grow dank robust plants we understand

592
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,339
about full plant health we're breeding

593
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:14,879
for complete plant structure not just

594
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:17,970
tulips with [ __ ] most of the time I can

595
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:23,160
pick out a Dutch strain or genetics from

596
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:25,620
duck or from touch from Amsterdam with I

597
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,440
mean roll a joint and smoke it you know

598
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:30,750
put two roll three joints put two

599
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,029
American strains in one from Amsterdam

600
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,200
in there and I guarantee I'll be able to

601
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:40,440
pick out though the whitewashed just

602
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,480
completely blended everything tastes

603
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,390
berries and flowers yeah nobody

604
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:59,490
structure okay I don't want to go bash

605
00:24:45,390 --> 00:25:00,930
every website but yes I think the Dutch

606
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,009
have got a wheat and you know some

607
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,430
American breeders are probably

608
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:07,069
susceptible and guilty of it also

609
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,910
probably bred because we wanted to find

610
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:10,859
back in the day we didn't have a high

611
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,380
pressure sodium lamp or LED we probably

612
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:15,089
were using whatever finagled lamp we can

613
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,070
put together in the garage to make some

614
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:18,869
space to try to create a 12 12 flower

615
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:20,460
cycle out of the few seeds that we did

616
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:22,109
get from whatever we we got that we

617
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,730
didn't know where it came from but some

618
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:25,740
dude told us was tie stick but it was

619
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,789
probably from Mexico but we thought it

620
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,569
was cooler to tell our friends it was

621
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:32,339
Jamaican so your girl in these [ __ ]

622
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:34,619
maybe tie stick maybe Colombian may be

623
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,539
Jamaican seed there could be males could

624
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,039
be females could be who knows what it is

625
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,049
and they got to figure out how to grow

626
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,549
that so we may have gotten rid of the

627
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,750
good [ __ ] back in the day because we

628
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,579
didn't have the right lights we didn't

629
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,019
have the right knowledge we just wanted

630
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,009
something that finished quick and didn't

631
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,500
climb up into the lights

632
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,960
I grew for three years before I ever saw

633
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,210
a cloned or even made one so you just

634
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,970
did a bunch of seeds yeah why would kill

635
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,869
to have some

636
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,759
yeah oh yeah I thought about how many I

637
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:02,528
used by Mexican schwag weed back in the

638
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,960
day where I live Mexican schwag Revis

639
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:06,788
450-500 ollars a pound it was everywhere

640
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,379
and you could get a half ounce of seeds

641
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:11,259
out of it it looked like good healthy

642
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:12,638
viable seeds I almost wonder what I

643
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:14,858
would have gotten from them because you

644
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:18,428
know those Mexican crops were producing

645
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:20,918
a low yielding stream remember the lime

646
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,840
green Christmas but yes I grew out some

647
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,599
seats how did that come out it was lime

648
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,038
green Christmas play so it was just I

649

655
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:41,579
you call it Christmas but cuz this town

656
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:45,308
is known for getting the light greens

657
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:47,378
Christmas Christmas yes that's amazing

658
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:49,269
now that I know more about growing and

659
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:51,939
everything that's I guarantee that's

660
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:54,878
probably oughta flour isolate season yep

661
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,710
but there there's a lot of talk about

662
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:58,238
the Mexican cartels using auto flour

663
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,249
strains so that they can keep stuff

664
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:02,079
going year-round and we talked about the

665
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:03,759
one crop that was busted and the forest

666
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,949
near us that was all Otto flowers knew

667
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,149
yeah that's so yeah that's how they do

668
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,098
that yeah they're there those grows our

669
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:15,339
cookie cutter there's every single one

670
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:18,249
of them is the same I mean there are

671
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:21,249
different locations but the way they

672
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:22,690
grow I mean that the cops I can tell by

673
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,909
looking at the pictures but also time

674
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,190
even the cops know you know the DEA

675
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,200
there's just a certain like [ __ ]

676
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,080
Willie and his crew were here again so

677
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,200
if you're ever going to bust the pickle

678
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,538
grow that somewhere find out what that

679
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,700
is and grow just like yeah it's a

680
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:41,200
Mexican food like buying foods in the

681
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,659
Mexican store with no English on the

682
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,739
labels and just store a bunch of it

683
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,499
there cuz I think that's what gives them

684
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:49,119
the first hint like it's a bunch of what

685
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,009
did they call Mexican nationals is what

686
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:52,269
they label them as in the paper so yeah

687
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:57,399
like how do you know that we found

688
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:59,169

689
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:00,908
mad when I found seeds of my weed like

690
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,169

691
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,700

00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:12,278
window on Phish tour I wish I had those

696
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:15,700
I uh when I was out in California one

697
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,470
time the first time I was exposed to the

698
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,359
whole medical marijuana scene and

699
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,538
everything kind of changed my life

700
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:28,058
actually I smoked some OG Kush out there

701
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:30,069
from my then girlfriends cousin that it

702
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:32,829
was full of seats and I brought him back

703
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:36,210
even and just over moved

704
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:39,638
moving from you know over the years I

705
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,139
lost them so that's yeah you'll find

706
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:43,449
them when the time is right hopefully no

707

they're long I just know you guys to

708
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,350
talk about my first experience with

709
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,730
medical marijuana because I just I've

710
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:50,259
got a cool [ __ ] story I'm not gonna

711
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,368
tell on this but it's another podcast I

712
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:57,999
just thought about that I saw four K

713
00:28:54,368 --> 00:29:00,488
room it was a line down all [ __ ] now

714
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:02,470
that I'm a more experienced grower or

715
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,569
like total Cali style [ __ ] flood and

716
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,889
rating table nice cool slabs and

717
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:08,528
everything that's the way to do it but

718
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:11,168
the fast crank it just blew my mind it

719
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:13,659
was like the oh man all these things I

720
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,669
thought about that room then like just

721
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:18,850
how huge it was and how much money they

722
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:21,970
must make and all that how much work it

723
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,888
was and now I kind of chuckle but yeah

775
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,848
I could be completely wrong by the

776
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,220
Northern Lights I know it's bull rider

777

newspaper you got ground traffic phone

810
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,669
books wood chunks bark type stuff I

811
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:43,319
imagine comfrey come the Bocage you Popo

812
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:46,980
kashi bucket pulp and that's pretty oh I

813
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,259
threw in some oyster shell got some

814
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:54,360
malted barley seed okay moister shell

815
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:57,000
just to get some cal-mag and I was told

816
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,278
by a warm keeping friend that oyster

817
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,200
shell helps poke the worms themselves up

818
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,308
but make them fatter huh yeah make them

819
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,110
eat more and make them work a little

820
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:09,269
harder yeah okay so and part of my plan

821
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:11,369
with this big warm container is to

822
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:16,500
release in my garden in the spring early

823
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:18,538
summer so that I'm just I'm building up

824
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,788
the soil in my garden year after year

825
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,589
after year yeah if I can dump I mean

826
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:24,569
[ __ ] ten thousand worms or something

827
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:26,069
like that I might end up push you don't

828
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,689
even know that'd be amazing it has

829
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:30,230
turned that soil all day long

830
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:34,710
yeah yeah you and your dad go fishin

831
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,339
yeah but I know okay fly fisherman okay

832
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,450
purist

833
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,548
you don't want to just go sit there all

834
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,690
day gonna do something yeah no that's

835
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:44,819
not really my type of fish I understand

836
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:47,070
so now we've got well we've gotten dope

837
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:49,528
as compost now yeah what do we do with

838
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:52,288
that do we want to cut some of that 50%

839
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,700
25% with regular soil let's let's act

840
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:55,349
like we're gonna put it into a potted

841
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,000
plant to grow either indoors or outdoors

842
00:33:55,349 --> 00:34:00,178
how much of that compost do you want to

843
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,398
use um if you're building a soil from

844
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:06,538
scratch I would recommend like 30 40

845
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,098
percent okay compost you don't have to

846
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:10,769
use that much that's just I mean that's

847
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:12,780
ideal 30 it's available yeah yeah if

848
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:14,280
you've got that you know you want to top

849
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,320
dress that or do you want to blend it in

850
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,330
when you start if you're building the

851
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,200
soil I would totally recommend blending

852
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:24,119
it

853
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:26,158
if you are top dressing I would do want

854
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,010
to say like a quarter cup per gallon

855
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,059
container oh okay so if you got a seven

856
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:34,500
gallon I would

857
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:35,969
come in three and a half cups yeah you

858
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,210
did the odd number to yourself I see you

859
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:44,519
know what I do yeah yeah what'd I tell

860
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:47,849
the guys at work and if you're

861
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:52,079
recharging the soil or like reusing a

862
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:54,779
soil like Jeff does I would probably say

863
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,329
like 20 percent okay five percent maybe

864
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,519
all right maybe even as low as 15 it

865
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:01,799
kind of depends on how much aeration

866
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,920
your soil has and if you want to add any

867
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
end or if or not so okay aeration is

868
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,849
important you guys we learned our lesson

869
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,380
I put some plants into cocoa and I did

870
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,360
not put anything in there to aerate it

871
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,320
and those plants pretty much gave me the

872
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,910
middle finger their whole lives you know

873
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,680
it's super compressed you gotta fill

874
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:21,569
that up with some perlite put something

875
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,319
in there to kind of air it up for sure

876
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,570
all right

877
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,769
you can also make teas with your compost

878
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,800
yes that's awesome yeah so with compost

879
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:35,219
make sure you have a consistent

880
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,670
temperature I've been told if you let it

881
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:41,429
get too warm you can potentially have

882
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,500
some funky stuff okay and your tea or in

883
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:44,489
the compost itself in your tea okay all

884
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,769
right

885
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:51,659
a lot of people talk crap about compost

886
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:55,050
or you'll find people that talk [ __ ]

887
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:58,980
about it one of the things they claim is

888
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,500
as ecoli in it which it possibly could

889
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,170
have ecoli in it okay but it also has a

890
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,289
million other [ __ ] things that are

891
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,420
way nastier than ecoli that don't harm

892
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,639
us wouldn't a large percentage of your

893
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,940
fruits and vegetables have ecoli anyway

894
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:18,239
when you purchase them trace amounts at

895
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,389
least they're shipped yeah okay it's so

896
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,789
would that mean maybe not to use a

897
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,989
compost tea as a foliar feed well that's

898
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,279
that's the way to get around that right

899
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:29,159
just feed it to the roots and not the

900
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,740
foliar yeah I personally would never use

901
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,899
an actual compost tea for foliar either

902
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,500
yeah I would strictly save that for worm

903
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,280
castings okay yeah for sure

904
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,570
all right so that's the way to get

905
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,860
around that you know worry there feed it

906
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,890
to the soil magical happened that you

907
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,559
call it goes away

908
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:47,650
yeah and also with compost you can make

909
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,369
it concentrate where just take your

910
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,170
compost put it in a cheesecloth

911
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:55,389
massage it in water or underneath water

912
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,590
for about 10 minutes like you know put

913
00:36:55,389 --> 00:37:02,379
it in a bucket of water just kind of rub

914
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:03,670
it out a little yeah okay that's

915
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,010
actually what you're doing you rubbing

916
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,039
it out you need it like a loaf of bread

917
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:12,460
okay yeah all right perverts and then

918
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:15,969
that makes a compost or worm casting you

919
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,740
can do either one a concentrate and it

920
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:20,319
has a longer shelf life than an aerated

921
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:22,809
tea okay Wow yeah that's useful

922
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,970
something I just learned yeah you're

923
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,139
taking old food scraps and recycled dirt

924
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,399
and putting it in cheesecloth and

925
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:29,859
squeezing it and making your own

926
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,720
nutrients yeah why not do this let's

927
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,440
stop making waste let's stop wasting

928
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,849
[ __ ]

929
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,470
let's stop spending money on companies

930
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:38,049
that do not really support the cannabis

931
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,699
movement or us or our wallets yeah let's

932
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,670
stop making trucks drive across the

933
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:44,199
country with bottles of water because

934
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,000
that's you're paying for what when you

935
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:47,799
buy whatever brand to use I love

936
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,719
Botanica but still every time I buy a

937
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,080
bottle of pure Belen pro where liquid

938
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,299
karma I had to pay a truck to drive that

939
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,920
[ __ ] from Arizona to Colorado then I had

940
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,280
to pay some dude or the hydro shot with

941
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,510
a mullet to [ __ ] sell it to me and

942
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,710
then I had to buy it home and measure it

943
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,470
out I probably could have just taken

944
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,909
some kelp and seabird guano whatever the

945
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:09,969
[ __ ] else is in that product and I could

946
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:12,909
have made my own probably even bench

947
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:16,659
less blue yeah I mean if you wanna grow

948
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:20,529
salts you could still be good it's kind

949
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:21,699
of environmentally friendly yes yes what

950
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,530
I'm getting at is I could make that and

951
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:25,599
I don't have to add to that truck

952
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:28,690
driving that emissions though water

953
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,849
being shipped the gas the exhaust like

954
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:35,530
we could do it ourselves and not only

955
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:37,599
that you're diverting food from going

956
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,180
into the landfill exactly so you're just

957
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,369
you're basically money from going right

958
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:43,779
into the same landfill yeah yeah put it

959
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:45,028
back into your crop back in your wallet

960
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,159
you're

961
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:49,259
using something you're not depending on

962
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,479
someone for that little tiny bit of your

963
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:54,568
life you know it only may be that part

964
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:56,788
but I love you know trying to be a

965
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:58,288
producer not a consumer you know it may

966
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:01,679
sound a little weird but it there's a

967
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:03,900
good feeling knowing that my vivacious

968
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,329
healthy green vigorous cannabis plants

969
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,949
are on nearly the same diet as myself oh

970
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:09,809

know it'd be cool if you follow suit but

1046
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,150
if you feel like you want to be

1047
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:04,709
different do what you need to do also

1048
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,920
let me remind you about a new service

1049
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:09,360
I've signed up for it is called patreon

1050
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,530
patreon is a service that will allow my

1051
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,230
listeners to make a financial

1052
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,370
contribution to the show if they feel so

1053
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,380
inclined if you feel like the

1054
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,179
information or knowledge or friendship I

1055
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,320
have provided you or just you want throw

1056
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:28,889
some money around go to

1057
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:30,570
patreon.com/scishow beat as little as $1

1058
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:31,949
I honestly don't think there's a limit

1059
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,230
to the amount of zeroes you can add to

1060
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,299
that yeah so however many zeroes you

1061
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,400
want to add to that dollar sign go ahead

1062
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,470
put a 5 put a 9 in front of there

1063
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,940
however you want to do it no I would

1064
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:43,649
appreciate though if you sign up for

1065
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,750
patreon you can contribute $1 to the

1066
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,190
show it will charge you every the first

1067
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,809
of every month and then that will send

1068
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,220
that right over to my PayPal account and

1069
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,570
honestly I'm not trying to make a bunch

1070
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,730
of money off my friends and my listeners

1071
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,559
what that will do that will help me pay

1072
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,269
for the cost of my website you guys I

1073
