[Music]

32

I think that's how the podcast is gonna

33
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:28,939
start is with a big fat [ __ ] blue dream

34
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,650
so you guys we are back we're here it's

35
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,329
gonna save the studio this can this

36
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,770
officially be a studio I think when all

37
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,019
the gears that we can call it a studio

38
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:38,119
that's fair so today we've got the

39
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:39,679
pocket studio we're recording on the we

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,329
are recording my mouth is [ __ ] high

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,400
my brains not as high as my mouth I

42
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,929
think we're recording on the zoom h6

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,310
handy recorder you guys I'm doing a

44

little test run I want to make sure that

45
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,400

46
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,140

day so when there's politicking to be

74
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,480
done when there's uh people have to go

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,189
to City Council meetings and speak and

76
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,840

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,819
community you guys we need people like

107
00:03:53,949 --> 00:04:00,419
you on the team Mike dude awesome you

108
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,949
showed up with this orange flavor e

109
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,849
citrusy grapefruit hashed it's a little

110
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:08,949
more about that lemon thyme sugar wax

111
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:12,639
from rock and extracts it's a new Pueblo

112
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,919
company I really like it I took it to uh

113
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,689
just as something fun to take along with

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,000
me to a meeting of several uh

115
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,730
jab kids is the wrong term but it's the

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,259
closest one we got I guess but several

117
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,169
folks getting together davon and it

118
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,310
ended up being the talk of the table

119
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:30,459
which I thought was funny because we

120
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:39,069
were dab in raw herbs on distillate that

121
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:40,629
night - is this a fresh frozen product

122
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,029
how much do you know about that I'm

123
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,659
actually not sure on that particular

124
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:49,299
step the big part the big pitch of this

125
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,450
company is this it's a proprietary mix

126
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,728
gasps okay extraction that explains a

127
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,918
lot to me somebody that knows a lot not

128
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,779
a lot but that smokes a lot of different

129
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,250
types of concentrates I can tell that

130
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:03,250
this that's why I asked if it was live

131
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,680
resin because your color and texture

132
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,329
color and texture are not what I'm used

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,090
to seeing from a butane extraction

134
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:14,069
unless it's live resin it is very very

135
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,069
close to what I see you call that color

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,719
it's a butterscotch color that's a

137
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:22,029
really good description of it it's not

138
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,400
orange it's not yellow and when it was

139
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:30,609
fresh it had a little more orange

140
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:32,918
yellowish pop to it okay but it's a

141
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,410
propane butane man yes I can see the

142
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,329
problem it's this is legitimately the

143
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,640
first propane hash I've ever dabbed I've

144
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:42,098
seen it made there's a great vice media

145
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,348
documentary where they go and interview

146
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:46,569
a guy building a propane extraction rig

147
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:48,759
in the the hash that comes out of that

148
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,978
is like frighteningly orange like cheese

149
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,899
at orange okay well what I've smoked a

150
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:55,079
bunch of propane hash oil from our

151
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,909
friends at altitude organic medicine

152
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,319
excuse me for that you guys I've smoked

153
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,599
a bunch of propane hash from altitude

154
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,279
and it's always white like completely

155
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:05,379
white and it's real lot it's kind of

156
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,869
mushy and it always stays really good

157
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:09,728
what I don't like about it is it kind of

158
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,348
makes my lungs feel sort of heavy it

159
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:14,918
gives me a butter long sort of feeling

160
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:17,709
um I over dab myself with some of this

161
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:20,769
one night I I way overheated my banger

162
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:23,469
and took an insanely hot dab just not

163
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,449
paying attention the last one I'd taken

164
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,349
a little cool so I was a little you know

165
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:31,120
job trying to make oh yeah and not while

166
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,589
I was coughing the cough seemed to go on

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,030
quite a while and for a minute I

168
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:38,739
considered is it the mixed gas but from

169
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,559
everything I've seen all the lab testing

170
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,538
it's it's totally clean okay like we

171
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,800
talked about lipids and plant fats and

172
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,228
all that kind of stuff on an episode

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,848
previous so I wonder if there are plant

174
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:50,199
paraffins and lipids and stuff like that

175
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:53,199
left behind in there that they're not

176
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,519
taking out either way it's marvelous

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,949
hash is what I wanted to get to the

178
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,409
flavors oh my goodness yeah it's like ah

179
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,699
at first it was like orgy and then I

180
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,590
waited a few minutes and as my mouth

181
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,089
dried up it turned to grapefruits just

182
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,319
straight-up grapefruits on my tongue it

183
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,668
was really delicious I didn't want to

184
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,009
take a drink for a while but I had to

185
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:10,629
except the grapefruit coating now it's

186

238
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,710
product I'd been I'd spent a lot of time

239
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,539
going through the edible section making

240
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,430
tried tried kind of one of everything

241
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,529
and I'm doing the same thing with the

242
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,939
hash lately and it's it's a lot of fun

243
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,439
it's fun watching you step up your hash

244
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,690
game it's so expensive piece by piece

245
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,610
you started off basically I think I gave

246
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,520
you your first stab probably yep I would

247
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:29,519
assume yeah it was the hot oil days yeah

248
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,100
the syringe of black co2 oil on the

249
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,779
dabber

250
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,519
oh those days when they were selling us

251
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,049
dental pick dabbers at the events for

252
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,370
like the price of dab tools and they

253
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:41,549
were just old dental divers from

254
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,779
Pakistan yep yeah oh man so but it's

255
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,639
good to see you stepped up you went from

256
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,289
taking little tiny dabs of just booboo

257
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,720
to now you take pretty good sized dabs

258
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:51,059
of some Clementine sugar wax bro right

259
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,590
it's nice I got you a decent sized dab

260
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,119
of some pineapple jack set up there

261
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,670
that's gonna make you coffee good the

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,500
last pineapple Jack who which company

263
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,429
made this was it sir yeah this is from

264
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,399
the turf

265
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:04,588
the the shop got in a shipment of that a

266
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
long time ago and I ended up with like

267
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,940
eight of them at home by the time we

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,610
sold out I had a a back stash I probably

269
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,410
grew that it was delicious yeah that's a

270
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,528
really great strain it grows very well

271
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:18,088
very very well it's uh it's actually New

272
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,948
York pineapple Diesel is what it would

273
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,540
be it's a pineapple diesel cross on

274
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:22,919
accident I think but there were a bunch

275
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,269
of seeds and that's what came out is

276
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,599
that phenotype and it grows like a

277
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:29,070
[ __ ] savage super sweet it's a great

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,120
it's a great plan so we've been talking

279
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,040
for quite a while here I don't think

280
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,959
we've gotten in the any sort of topic at

281
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,208
well I'd say since debut let the

282
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,099
listeners know yeah yeah well the first

283
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,229
stop I'm gonna read a couple of email

284
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,180
maybe maybe two depends on how long we

285
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,379
go I'm gonna read one email we'll talk

286
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,509
about that I should find my phone

287
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,028
because it's on there I wanted to remind

288
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,789
everybody that I did promise everybody a

289
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:51,990
podcast about the dab in granny

290
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,639

that podcast at the can of Canyon and

292
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,528
unfortunately I got home and my memory

293
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,730
card would not let me pull the files it

294
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,620
would let me drag the files from the

295
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,389
memory card to my desktop but they will

296
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,310
not play they won't play from the memory

297
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,278
card they won't play from the desktop I

298
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,929
even took the zoom h6 and ran the USB

299
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,639
cable to the computer and tried to open

300
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:14,549
the files that way and use it as a file

301
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,370
reader it will not do it so far with my

302
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,429
tech skills that that shows lost so what

303
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,659
I have done is I set up another show I'm

not gonna tell you when cuz you might

305
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,110

306
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,698
davin granny myself

307
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,500
Brett Lindsey and maybe a couple of the

308
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:32,629
folks are going to congregate at the can

309
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,629
Acadian Mike is gonna cough his face off

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,190
the Gavin grannie podcast so stick

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,209
around that will be coming up in the

313
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,699
very near future

314
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,559
uh we're gonna read that email I said

315
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:51,059
that the one thing I want to talk about

316
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,619
with Mike the main thing because Mike is

317
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,739
our smart friend that comes over with

318
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,909
smart [ __ ] ladies and gentlemen the DEA

319
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,769
has failed to reschedule cannabis is

320
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:04,169
still considered a Schedule one drug

321
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,818
which let me tell you what that means

322
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:07,649
schedule one drugs are the most

323
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:10,259
dangerous drugs with the most potential

324
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,029
for abuse and psychological dependence

325
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,519
so

326
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:17,720
Cannabis still is in the same category

327
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:21,079
as LSD as heroin and ecstasy there is no

328
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,649
medicinal value Mike how do you feel

329
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:28,759
about that I saw it coming a mile away

330
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,340
but I'm still disappointed it's 2016 so

331
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,500
about 90 days ago the DEA said that they

332
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,420
were considering rescheduling cannabis

333
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,679
they taunted everybody they teased us

334
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,990
they made us all think that there may be

335
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,699
a change and then in 90 days they just

336
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,490
said oh never mind sorry we're not gonna

337
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,270
do that well there was a change and it

338
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,490
is big it's just not as big as the media

339
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:53,629
made it sound they didn't reschedule

340
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:56,509
cannabis but they did open up more

341
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:59,960
research growths production sites for

342
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,629
cannabis for pretty much everybody

343
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,250
listenings whole lifetime the feds have

344
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,659
been growing marijuana for research

345
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,679
purposes at the University of

346
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:13,399
Mississippi sorry I'm still dabbed out

347
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,809
but that's the only farm that grew it

348
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,350
and if you've been watching Sanjay

349
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:21,879
Gupta's weed 1 2 &amp; 3 specials on CNN

350
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,769
they covered the research restriction

351
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:27,740
topic pretty well basically there's only

352
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,019
one farm growing research marijuana in

353
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,200
the u.s. which means there's almost no

354
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:36,259
variety of cannabis to research in the

355
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,180
US they've only got four strains or some

356
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,710
really restricted numbers sorry my lungs

357
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,819
are still going a little nuts good dad

358
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,050
good we can hear it but you're good

359
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,550
you're saying you're making enough sense

360
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:46,339
to make it matter yeah I hope you guys

361
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:48,500
are following along I'm trying really

362
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,330
hard not to watch it right into the

363
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,179
minds do it really well to see the look

364
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,080
on his face so this makes you dumb it's

365
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:58,849
nonsense you're just stoned you guys

366
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,860
I've seen the cannabis that they grow at

367
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,389
that facility there in Mississippi and

368
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,830
it's garbage they don't have a proper

369
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,330
growth facility they don't have proper

370
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,250
technique I don't think they have good

371
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,320
genetics I've seen what they're doing

372
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,759
and it isn't it's an embarrassing growth

373
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,710
my girl looks like that I would put

374
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,149
matches to it they should be ashamed of

375
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,910
what they were producing when I saw the

376
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:19,220
last footage in there there's you can

377
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:21,230
pull up some footage on YouTube what a

378
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,970
lot of it looks like and when you listen

379
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,590
to the researchers talk they tell you oh

380
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,110
we can produce

381
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:31,190
anything that's requested we can mix a

382
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,230
batch of 19% THC or 10 percent or 4

383
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,540
percent or 12 percent whatever you want

384
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,039
and when you look at what he's talking

385
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:38,809
about he's basically like well we just

386
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,319
grind up enough leaf and stem in there

387
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:45,289
to bring the 21 down to 12 or the grind

388
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,210
enough but over the 4% until it's a 9%

389
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,529
and it's yeah it's not pretty

390
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,620
I've seen their facility and I don't

391
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,120
think they ever passed 15% the feds have

392
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:59,000
run a medical marijuana program since 82

393
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,610
where patients get mailed 11 ounces each

394
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,250
of pre-rolled joints every month and

395
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,190
like a coffee can like a really cool

396
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,419
coffee tin that's actually a bizarre

397
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,750
collectible in the u.s. now because you

398
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:13,189
can find them on ebay from time to time

399
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,659
in one of the federal patients that does

400
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,480
a lot of public speaking we'll give them

401
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:20,719
away for charity events like silent

402
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,850
auctions and stuff but the marijuana

403
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,910
that those patients get is from this

404
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,710
farm and some of the video of it

405
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,449
especially that was taking away

406
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,320
conferences in the late 90s early

407
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,790
thousands the quality is just atrocious

408
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,360
if they have to unroll the pre roll

409
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:40,969
joints rehydrated in the fridge like old

410
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,350
hippie style with a piece of lettuce or

411
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,509
a piece of bread to bring the moisture

412
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,639
content up real quick and then reroll it

413
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,379
like Mexican brick weed from America yep

414
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,120
why don't they need to hire somebody

415
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,439
that hey guys in Mississippi hire me I

416
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,230
know how to grow cannabis let's do this

417
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,600
yeah it's gotten better since a lot of

418
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,700
that footage was shot I hope so

419
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,290
did you see the CNN footage do you know

420
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,030
it well enough to discuss quality from

421
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,439
that I think that's the footage that I

422
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,939
saw they walk into the room with like it

423
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,590
looks like a shitty LED and they've got

424
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,560
like a small hydro table and the plants

425
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:16,519
just look sad the plants totally looks

426
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,649
yeah it's definitely not like Colorado

427
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,750
commercial production quality it's

428
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,730
definitely not home grill quality yeah

429
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,840
yeah remember the guy we went to his

430
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,340
house and he had those super stretchy

431
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,600
plants with the UFO light above them

432
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,430
that's what it made me think of you know

433
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,830
I'm talking about right away yeah

434
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:34,059
I was like oh that guy's grown over

435
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,980
there [ __ ] some struggle buds yes

436
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,899
struggle buddy very very good quality by

437
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,259
the looks of it so they're the DEA

438
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,269
claims that cannabis does not have a

439
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,399
currently accepted medical use in the US

440
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,110
and there is a lack of accepted safety

441
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,950
for its use under medical supervision

442
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,509
and it has a high potential for abuse

443
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,940
all of that is [ __ ] you guys what

444
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,649
what why aren't worried Mike why is it

445
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,890
the DEA smart enough to see that all of

446
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,049
that is [ __ ] oh they totally do so

447
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,959
what's their was there it's not it

448
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:07,938
doesn't have anything to do with

449
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,459
marijuana itself in everything to do

450
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:14,900
with seceding power in my opinion

451
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,910
marijuana being illegal is an amazingly

452
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,050
powerful tool it does several things

453
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:25,220
that they want to keep happening if they

454
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:26,659
lose that stick they lose a lot there

455
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,509
are a lot of things that are built on

456
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,120
that pyramid they crumble after is it

457
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:33,679
the pharmaceutical industry there are

458
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,449
definitely financial interest is this

459
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,320
president is it the prison industry um

460
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,058
there's been some good reporting lately

461
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:44,359
Washington I don't remember which paper

462
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:46,549
but looking at major lobbying efforts

463
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,039
recently against marijuana rescheduling

464
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,359
against marijuana legalization and a lot

465
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,029
of that's coming from alcohol and

466
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,579
pharmaceuticals alcohol pharmaceutical

467
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,859
prisons okay well there's a big report

468
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,139
out recently that legal marijuana states

469
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,969
in medical marijuana states huge

470
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,520
reductions in Medicare and Medicaid

471
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,269
prescription billing oh wow

472
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:11,179
and it was an in enough states and over

473
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,970
the same time lines to draw causation

474
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:17,420
conclusions not a one-to-one like

475
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,808
mathematical conclusion but enough to

476
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,808
infer that where people have easy free

477
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,549
legal access to cannabis they can just

478
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:28,579
swing by a store and get it basically

479
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,409
they consume significantly less

480
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:33,139
prescription drugs and that's a huge

481
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:37,300
loss to a major industry same thing with

482
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,320
alcohol when twenty-something males have

483
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,279
marijuana that they can go buy at a

484
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,710
store

485
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,859
they consume significantly less alcohol

486
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,620
on my mic sounded really hot sorry

487
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:50,719
honestly when I got my first medical

488
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,159
marijuana card I told myself and my

489
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,720
friends and my family I was like you

490
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,029
know what I can smoke all the cannabis I

491
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,220
want I'm gonna quit drinking and they're

492
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,829
like [ __ ] and here it is probably

493
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,089
six seven eight years maybe later I

494
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:03,980
haven't drank since I started using

495
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:06,199
medical cannabis since I was able to go

496
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,519
to the dispensary and point at that jar

497
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,009
and say let me get an ounce of that

498
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,779
tastiness right there and go home and

499
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:13,609
roll up and puff down as hard as I want

500
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,779
without any worries cuz back in the day

501
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,789
I didn't know where I was gonna buy my

502
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,259
next weed you have to deserve that outs

503
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,369
cuz you paid way too much and you don't

504
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,319
know if that dude is gonna have good

505
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:23,029
weed or not next time now you can

506
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,250
medicate as needed I don't need to drink

507
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,660
any alcohol I don't like being drunk I'm

508
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,279
no good I don't know if I'm really good

509
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,560
at it or really bad at it I'm not sure

510
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,690
I'm not sure what the case is but I know

511
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,029
that it's not my friend I don't wake up

512
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:38,330
hungover and regretful when I smoked

513
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:41,149
cannabis I've got a very similar story

514
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:43,039
it's not I quit drinking before I had a

515
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,570
medical marijuana card but essentially

516
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,319
the same thing is I got really good at

517
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:49,759
drinking and I decided that I didn't

518
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,220
like some of those character traits so I

519
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,140
was gonna take a couple days off couple

520
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,779
days became a week and now it's been

521
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,009
like eight years like I went to Mardi

522
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:04,460
Gras two years ago and had three beers

523
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:06,289
like just like with dinners just because

524
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,789
I was there and I was at sea level and I

525
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,319
wouldn't feel the repercussions of it

526
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,240
the next day like I would have had I had

527
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,639
up three beers here is that where Davey

528
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,680
happened bro no we found out we found

529
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:22,070
out about Davey the day after we got to

530
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:24,920
New Orleans sort of how we found out the

531
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:27,019
the day we got there she took a sip her

532
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,600
first drink and got queasy and was like

533
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,759
man and then the second day the same

534
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,750
thing and after the second day she was

535
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
like go to Walgreens

536
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,819
oh-ho yep so we were in New Orleans for

537
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,230
10 days and we found out we were

538
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,029
pregnant on the second day you get to

539
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,190
celebrate while you're there kind of we

540
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,240
did it was a it was great we celebrated

541
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,650
the whole time we had a truckload of

542
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,750
good food neither of us were real heavy

543
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,890
drinkers anyway so it's not like we're

544
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,250
missing out on anything

545
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:55,670
yeah but ya had a great time and I had a

546
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,410
lot to celebrate but yes I don't really

547
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,330
drink and a lot of it has to do with I

548
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,420
can relax and unwind with cannabis and

549
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:05,419
it's a much better unwind there's no

550
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,120
there's no penalty the next day and

551
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,130
that's what I hated about drinking is

552
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,649
the incredibly bad decisions that would

553
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,690
make while drinking and then waking up

554
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,000
the next day getting while you're drunk

555
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,590
right just figuring out how to get home

556
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,480
DRI am I gonna drive I'm gonna take a

557
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:23,329
taxi am I gonna jump in one of my drunk

558
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,308
friends cars ah so many nights I

559
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,589
somebody so many mornings have woken up

560
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:29,329
saying I am so thankful that I made it

561
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,129
home last night I talked to someone

562
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:38,569
today who's like I quit drinking this

563
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:40,309
morning and it's like yeah the point

564
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:42,289
we're at here is people are consuming

565
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:44,240
less cannabis are consuming less alcohol

566
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:48,609
they're consuming less pills because we

567
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,319
were able to access cannabis safely it's

568
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:52,969
it's there's a lot of people who don't

569
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,970
want that to happen and there's a lot of

570
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,240
people who don't want to lose that lever

571
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,259
of control on people it's an immediate

572
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,450
excuse to get to further a car stop I

573
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:07,460
smell marijuana there's there's not one

574
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,080
video on YouTube where the cop goes I

575
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,539
smell heroin I want to search your

576
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,829
vehicle I want to smoke cocaine or I

577
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,710
smell cocaine I want to search your

578
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:18,379
vehicle right that video doesn't exist

579
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,169
it never gets said I I think I smell a

580
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,090
gun I want to search your vehicle I

581
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:24,380
think I smell someone you're smuggling

582
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:26,959
in your trunk I want to search your

583
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,190
vehicle that video doesn't exist every

584
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,850
single video is I think I smell

585
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,590
marijuana when that steps away

586
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,119
everything for law enforcement gets a

587
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,769
little bit harder that is so true

588
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,298
because I recently got pulled over I

589
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:39,859
talked about it on the show and the

590
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:42,349
first thing that cop said was do you

591
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,089
have any marijuana in the vehicle and I

592
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:45,589
had to reprogram my brain real quickly

593
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,668
because first I was weak no sir there's

594
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:49,069
no weed in here but then I was like wait

595
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:50,720
a minute it's 2016 bro you've got your

596
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,798
badge on you've got your purple card in

597
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,870
your pocket and I looked him straight in

598
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,819
the face and I go it may be because I

599
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,469
wasn't certain but there may be there

600
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:58,909
could be weeding here he's like it

601
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,980
smells really strong I was like oh I

602
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,400
work in agro and just being honest with

603
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,990
them

604
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,190
that she's everything he had no problem

605
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,349
to mess with me now so you're right that

606
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,210
does take all the stress I'm not a

607
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,740
criminal anymore yep the only thing I

608
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,509
used to do wrong was have a bunch of

609
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,559
weed in the car those first couple law

610
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:17,750
enforcement interactions are bizarre it

611
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,950
you dude it's almost a genetic response

612
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,750
with this community at this point right

613
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,789
because if we admit to being part of the

614
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,099
cannabis community or having cannabis or

615
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,420
supporting it in any way we subject

616
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,629
ourselves to all sorts of horrible

617
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,330
things in Colorado that's not true

618
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,140
anymore and as those realization sets in

619
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:38,389
it's awesome

620
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,700
have you been to an event or a place

621
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,500
where you have consumed cannabis near

622
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,690
law enforcement then they've watched you

623
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,150
many for it was legal I I was up in

624
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,509
Denver and Boulder during the heydays of

625
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:57,410
the Boulder Prasad on 4/20 in the Civic

626
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,670
Center gatherings on 4/20 where tens or

627
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,710
hundreds of thousands of people get

628
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:04,210
together all at once everybody lights at

629
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,220
the same time sort of as a dare go ahead

630
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,440
there's 10,000 of us arrests 11 of us

631
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,089
see what happens right I'm like we're

632
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,490
gonna peacefully sit here and smoke pot

633
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:15,799
and play bad music and then cheer at

634
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:18,019
4:20 and all smoke pot together and

635
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:22,789
there'll be a big cloud and by 5 o'clock

636
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:24,740
we'll all be gone the shops in the area

637
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,319
that sell food will all make an extra 5

638
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,549
grand 10 grand that day everybody's

639
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:30,169
happy

640
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:32,059
everybody except people that have to

641
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,430
take public transportation or commute

642
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:36,950
during those hours anyway

643
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,590
but uber drivers are making mass

644
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,299
anything downtown Denver a hundred

645
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:44,959
thousand people just convene at Civic

646
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:47,299
Center the the cops stand by and they

647
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,340
always had and just kind of made sure

648
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,690
everything was calm and collected and

649
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:55,429
nobody got out of control and it was

650
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,299
fine but at post legalization only a few

651
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,490
okay

652
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:00,139
it's just I've been too busy I always

653
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,579
end up working those it's not the guy

654
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,980
that goes to all the events you're not

655
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:05,869
that dude there I desperately want to go

656
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,640
to like the next secret session I need

657
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,489
to get out and enjoy a few events now

658
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,200
August 22nd now that Davey's a little

659
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,410
bit older I can start doing that a

660
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,690
little bit yeah

661
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,550
yeah he's gonna be so much fun pretty

662
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,250
soon so I remember the first time we

663
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,960
used to go to smoke nights at the cloud9

664
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,519
hookah bar here in Puebla I've talked

665
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,960
about him on the podcast way back in the

666
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,569
early episodes cuz that was back in the

667
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,890
in the day here since then they've shut

668
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:31,379
him down we can't do that here in Pueblo

669
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,660
anymore but we were at the cloud9 hookah

670
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,220
bar and I was sitting I was at the bar

671
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,480
which is it's an old bar but it's now

672
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,650
turned into a hookah bar but they didn't

673
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
change much you know it still got the

674
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,580
bar seating they just put hookahs out I

675
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,979
was sitting at the bar and there was one

676
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,379
person and then me and in front of me is

677
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,660
my little oil slick pad my rig my torch

678
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,100
my little variety of hash I was hitting

679
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,420
a ball or a tow ball I was into Bowl

680
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,969
that night I had a bowl some flowers in

681
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,110
it had a bag of weed next to me I was

682
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,789
just chilling just sitting on the

683
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,649
barstool and the cops walked in three of

684
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,779
them together and I heard the radio you

685
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,310
always hear that and then they walk in

686
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,160
and I was like ah what do I do

687
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:07,169
and I thought [ __ ] sit here dude

688
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,180
you're a 21 year old you're over 21

689
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,940
you've got a red card in your pocket a

690
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,320
purple card now cannabis is legal the

691
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,000
owner of this place is who's gonna have

692
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,889
to [ __ ] deal with anything yep those

693
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,299
cops walked right past me and they went

694
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,800
and talked to the owner the owner nodded

695
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,809
and smiled a couple times they all shook

696
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,579
hands the cops walked past me and they

697
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,119
kind of looked at my what I had sitting

698
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,189
on the table

699
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,809
like they looked at it more curiously

700
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,490
they were like huh okay that's what

701
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,929
smoke and hash supplies look like and

702
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,339
they walked past it and they nodded I

703
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,019
mean they kind of smiled like hey what's

704
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,639
up stoner like one of them kind of

705
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,869
condescendingly smile like what's up you

706
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,220
weed head you're high as [ __ ] and the

707
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:41,129
other cheek just kind of nodded politely

708
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,039
they walked out one of the kids that was

709
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,660
there was younger dude just just being a

710
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,399
typical dude I probably would have said

711
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,600
the same thing [ __ ] 15 years ago but

712
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,970
as soon as they got outside he goes man

713
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,949
[ __ ] the police and I looked at him I

714
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,539
was like bro unfuck those police they

715
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,100
didn't take my hash and we didn't go to

716
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,899
jail cuz you were the first [ __ ]

717
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,909
they saw when they walked in here like

718
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,740
they didn't do anything so yeah it was I

719
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,420
had to remind him like we didn't go to

720
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,650
jail for that dude like two years ago

721
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,500
they would have threw me on the floor

722
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,780
like just for having that [ __ ] there

723
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,640
there are a lot of people who don't want

724
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,460
to give that out and yeah that's why you

725
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,690
see thing the DEA make decisions like

726
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,579
this it's it's it's just silly it is

727
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,620
silly if they if they would have

728
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,419
rescheduled cannabis to a Schedule 2

729
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,319
substance what that would have mean what

730
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,130
that would have meant is it would have

731
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,980
now been allowable for person

732
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,180
Asians by all medical doctors so they'd

733
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,430
be able to write you a prescription for

734
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:38,279
cannabis basically well and they'd also

735
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:41,019
it makes research significantly easier I

736
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,089
mean I hate to keep going back to CNN's

737
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:44,289
specials because CNN's usually obnoxious

738
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,789
as all hell but their marijuana

739
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:49,899
reporting that they've done has been

740
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:52,329
spectacular it's easy to research

741
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,060
cocaine in the u.s. because it's a

742
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:56,769
schedule 2 drug it's easy to see it's

743
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,740
easy to research schedule 2 drugs

744
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:02,230
because their schedule - if their

745
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,250
schedule one significantly more red tape

746
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:08,829
right much much harder to research and I

747
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,450
mean it takes years of going through

748
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:14,099
approval meeting since submitting

749
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,539
paperwork years to just begin your study

750
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:19,779
and then in studies take years to

751
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:21,789
complete they take more years to write

752
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:24,839
the conclusions examine the data all of

753
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:28,240
that and then more years to publish and

754
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,069
when you add another decade of red tape

755
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,660
at the beginning of all that marijuana

756
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:35,559
research is something that's not going

757
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,490
to happen it's a world net and that's

758
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,779
because it's a Schedule one drug and

759
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,990
moving it to schedule two changes all

760
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:45,730
that any competent researcher can submit

761
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,319
the paperwork and and within a

762
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,599
relatively reasonable amount of time

763
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,970
begin researching and none of those

764
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,549
changes were made and so even though

765
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,559
they created more places to grow it in

766
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,839
the selection of research grade cannabis

767
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,990
that's available to be researched will

768
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:04,329
it be expanding access to that material

769
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:08,680
won't be and that's really unfortunate

770
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:10,599
and this is why I rant and tell people

771
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,750
to vote because none of this [ __ ]

772
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,519
changes until a most of the people

773
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,279
involved in this have gotten old and

774
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:21,579
died like we just have to wait until the

775
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:23,769
generation that's so tied to this has

776
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,909
seceded power to our generation and it's

777
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,450
just going to take another couple of

778
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,040
decades and in the meantime we need more

779
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,470
people in our generation politically

780
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,680
active so many members of our community

781
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,980
tuned out because if we spoke up about

782
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,450
what we believed in we went to jail I

783
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,250
scared dude back in the day you would be

784
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,039
like come to these City Council meetings

785
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,349
with me and I was like no I grow and

786
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,329
that doesn't scared well and that's part

787
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:50,490
of the reason I became the politically

788
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:53,668
active one down here is because I didn't

789
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,880
physically have the space to grow or the

790
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:59,009
money for the startup equipment and so I

791
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,570
didn't like go ahead and show my house

792
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:05,579
warrant there's only 12 square feet

793
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:08,879
start with the dirty laundry prick like

794
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:09,389
I didn't care I like I could have cops

795
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,950
show up

796
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,059
I could have cops pull me over and

797
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:19,620
demand to search my car and I'd be okay

798
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:21,058
most of the time but I was able to risk

799
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,798
it where a lot of other people in the

800
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:25,980
community simply weren't in a position

801
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,048
to do that but one of the one of the

802
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,349
really interesting things that I noticed

803
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:35,700
when I spoke out is that it gives you a

804
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:37,349
shield when you go to City Council

805
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,029
meeting reporters for the local paper

806
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:42,740
there if you live in a major city

807
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:45,808
reporters from major papers are there

808
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,269
when the guy that comes down to City

809
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:50,129
Council or give the County Commissioner

810
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:53,730
meetings and makes really coherent

811
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:56,549
articulate arguments in the appropriate

812
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,860
manner and setting for marijuana gets

813
00:30:56,548 --> 00:31:01,079
his house raided they break a bunch of

814
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,389
furniture rough him up shoot his dog and

815
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,250
don't find anything that [ __ ] makes the

816
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,520
front page the Washington Post every day

817
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:11,609
for a week and they know this and so it

818
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,619
doesn't happen and that's not

819
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:16,469
universally true it's not being granted

820
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,239
immunity by a judge but it does provide

821
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,048
you a significant layer of protection

822
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,819
because by becoming mildly public you

823
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:26,069
you're granted some of that protection

824
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,990
yep all right so the DEA failed you guys

825
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:29,369
that was my point on that topic now I

826
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,808
want to move on to another topic here

00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,659
genetics I should give you guys a quick

860
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,808
update on that cuz I said I would do

861
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,330

863
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:49,199
you guys the mail plant just started

864
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:51,058
sprinkle in a little bit of pollen a

865
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,319
little itty bitty bitty bitty bits of

866
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,940
pollen are coming out of them the girls

867
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,099
are just starting to go into full flower

868
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,200
you can see their calyx pistols are just

869
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,689
going nuts right now the stretch phase

870
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,789
is in full fledge they'll quit

871
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,370
stretching in about a week I'll let them

872
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,720
get pollen in about seven to ten days

873
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,389
they'll start getting a lot of pollen on

874
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,100
them I've got pollen in a jar for backup

875
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,620
I've also got that male throw and pollen

876
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,000
they're gonna get pollinated so they're

877
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,439
looking great everything is going

878
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,329
beautifully on the breeding project

879
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,220
everything is on schedule not a whole

880
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,928
lot to report other than the male his

881
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,390
balls are big and he's just barely

882
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:26,309
starting to dump pollen so this message

883
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,170
says I was wondering what you know about

884
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:29,670
Fox tailing I don't really understand

885
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,279
what is happening and whether it's a

886
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,830
good or bad thing when it happens maybe

887
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,629
a good show topic and I replied with

888
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,699
great topic so that was a message that

889
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,770
actually came from a friend on Instagram

890
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,420
the emails been killer lately right I

891
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,529
get a lot of topics a lot of content

892
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,150
from the people that are sending me

893
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,889
emails I really appreciate that send me

894
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,080

896
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,308
the easiest way to reach me grow from

897
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:54,719
your heart at hotmail.com it's easier if

898
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,369
I filter all the questions through that

899
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,539
one channel I'll read your questions

900
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,279
wherever they come from honestly because

901
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,308
I know you're not some of us are friends

902
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,329
on Instagram on Twitter and whatever

903
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:04,950
wherever we're friends I'll read it but

904
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:06,359
it's easier you got more of a

905
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,490
it's if you hit me rolled from your

906
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,319
heart at hotmail.com right so this guy

907
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,549
wants to know about fox tailing fox

908
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,800
stealing is when you're growing a bug

909
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,869
some buds and they start popping off

910
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,190
like little bit fox dales at little

911
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:18,690
fingers they just get they start

912
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,329
spreading out a little bit I call them

913
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,369
cheeto fingers - cheeto fingers yeah but

914
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,589
yeah Fox tails is the appropriate sir

915
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:28,260
some strains its genetic

916
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:30,659
if the bud stays compact if it's tight

917
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,839
and it's doing what looks like a fox

918
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,148
tail more like a crown that's genetic if

919
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,460
it's if the bud is Airy and you're

920
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:41,098
getting fox tail II that is most likely

921
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,869
from too much heat that's usually what

922
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,309
that's from your plants are probably too

923
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,858
hot they're probably a little bit too

924
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:48,690
close to the light also coming with that

925
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:51,328
Fox tailing you may see a little bit of

926
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,519
taco leaf your leaf will look healthy

927
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:55,260
it'll look cool except on the edges

928
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,608
it'll be folding up like a taco shell

929
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,589
like you could just make a little taco

930
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,869
out of your leaf right there both of

931
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:02,670
those are visual descriptors yeah so if

932
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:05,280
you're seeing both of those it certainly

933
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,440
is too hot in there I've seen it most

934
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,089
often when we call it kissing the sky

935
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,670
where the plants grow up into the light

936
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:13,049
while they're in bloom yeah that's

937
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,690
probably what's happening - this guy's

938
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,160
poor plants yep if that's not the case

939
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,630
Fox tailing could be from too much

940
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,879
humidity they're trying to spread out

941
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,680
this is the grossest description I could

942
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,170
give you but it's completely accurate

943
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,399
Mike knows where I'm going with this

944
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,269
imagine you're in Las Vegas in the

945
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,769
summer it's like 114 degrees outside

946
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:34,079
your man junk tries to just move away

947
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,579
from your body these plants are doing

948
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,079
the same thing it's too hot your balls

949
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,190
want to get away these plants are too

950
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,450
hot they want to get away from each

951
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,679
other they're starting to sweat they're

952
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,939
getting funky they're just trying to

953
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,068
peel off of each other so they're not

954
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,289
getting sweaty and funky and compacted

955
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:48,000
in there the plants just trying to make

956
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:49,500
some air room for itself so it's trying

957
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,630
to get spongy it's Fox tailing out a

958
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,130
little bit it's gonna get fluffy it's

959
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,318
gonna it's getting heat stressed it's

960
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,480
probably what's happening or you could

961
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,519
be over feeding it that also could could

962
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,650
make Fox tailing happen if one of those

963
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,318
three it's it's nine times out of ten

964
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,568
your plant hit the light yeah some

965
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:09,119
Jillybean phenotypes like to make a

966
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:11,489
crown shape fox tail strawberry-banana

967
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,940
tangi likes to make some crown shape Fox

968
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:14,368
tails

969
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,619
tangey I guess it's a lot of things

970
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,390
cross to that Kali oh they're worse with

971
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,740
the Lemon Haze you know that did it

972
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,828
pick out within eight inches of the

973
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:25,409
light it was a [ __ ] okay but it was the

974
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:26,970
plant with drip and so the grower

975
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:28,348
wouldn't get rid of it because it would

976
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,598
just literally when you were harvesting

977
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,818
it would just drip THC it was insane

978
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,670
that's awesome I think I know that plant

979
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:38,130
talk about it the closer if it got into

980
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,079
the light it would foxtail like mad so

981
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,548
chances are bro your plant is getting

982
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,760
too close to the light it's a little bit

983
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:46,710
too hot if that if that's not the case

984
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,000
send me a follow a message and we'll

985
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,039
figure out what's going on we'll talk

986
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,088
about it on a future episode I truly do

987
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,609
appreciate the interaction with my

988
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:55,619
listeners send me more questions more

989
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:57,900
messages I love it you guys I like it a

990
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,028
lot alright I wanna read one more email

991
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,260
this one's gonna be quick I'm finding it

992
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:03,268
on my phone here I did take another

993
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,710
screenshot this one says hey I was

994
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:06,719
listening to the podcast today and I

995
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,429
heard you answer my questions on the air

996
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,288
this one's from mazza 4:20 by the way

997
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:12,179
and he said it was a trip and then he

998
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,140
said thanks for that bro when I see I

999
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,759
work with robots

1000
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:17,159
I just meant they act like robots cuz

1001
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,778
remember I had a real robot to these

1002
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,429
people that act like robots then he said

1003
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,599
I kind of like office space but

1004
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,949
different he said I got another question

1005
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,680
for the show I was hoping you could

1006
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,028
shine some light on then it says show

1007
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,129
questions number one what are your

1008
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:31,440
thoughts on monster cropping and he said

1009
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,059
I read that it's great to use first

1010
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,920
scrog honest I don't know a lot about

1011
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,359
monster cropping all you got to do is

1012
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,909
send me another message and tell me what

1013
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:40,739
monster cropping is and I'll tell you my

1014
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:42,389
opinions on it I'll learn about it just

1015
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,528
tell me what's going on there I don't

1016
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,639
know what you mean by monster cropping

1017
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,349
there's a couple things that could mean

1018
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,420
you could mean like snapping the stems

1019
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,490
and bending them if that's what you mean

1020
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,430
that's cool but it takes too long for my

1021
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:55,348
type of growth ah number 2 question he

1022
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:58,500
said I was curious to hear your thoughts

1023
00:37:55,349 --> 00:38:00,480
on LEDs any experience using one I don't

1024
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,039
have any personal experience with LEDs

1025
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,900
so I don't have a lot to tell you I tell

1026
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,390
it I can tell you that it changes the

1027
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,068
way your plants function they've use

1028
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:09,719
they do everything they use their

1029
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:12,659
nutrients differently they drink

1030
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,179
differently I've seen friends run side

1031
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:17,909
by sides with LEDs and HPS lights and

1032
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:19,469
the LED plants and the HBS lights looked

1033
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:21,719
completely different being fed the same

1034
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:23,818
thing they photosynthesize differently

1035
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,528
they want different nutrients it's a

1036
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:26,909
whole new thing to learn I don't have

1037
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:29,460
any experience with it personally

1038
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:31,029
I can't guide you on any lights to use I

1039
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,490
don't know enough

1040
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:36,460
spend a lot of time researching light

1041
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:38,769
spectrums and their effects on plants

1042
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,900
and yeah that is something I've only

1043
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,389
seen them really successfully regularly

1044
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,088
used as an auxiliary color augmentation

1045
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:48,670
right when they're a primary light

1046
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:50,559
source every harvest I've seen has been

1047
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,210
miniscule I'll give a shout-out to my

1048
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,880
friend Nancy bud well she grows with a

1049
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,269
very specific brand of LED lights and

1050
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,160
she kills it her plants are gorgeous

1051
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:02,920
yeah but I've only ever seen the the

1052
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,409
cheaper ones in action right never seen

1053
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,900
like the $1,800 version the lights that

1054
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,129
the Nancy are using those lights are

1055
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,010
quite expensive they're a thousand to

1056
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,410
1400 all our lights but LEDs can be

1057
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,790
extremely expensive but allegedly you

1058
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,259
pay for it in the first year and

1059
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,849
electrical savings right what you're

1060
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,470
gonna save yeah you gotta throw it down

1061
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,730
on the table to walk out with that light

1062
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:23,379
but you're not gonna have to pay the

1063
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,240
electric bill every month like I do with

1064
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,068
my HPS lights you don't have to run as

1065
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,169
much electricity on an air conditioner

1066
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:31,480
to cool it off also yep there's a there

1067
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,240
are power saving there it's just I've

1068
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,789
never seen them effectively used alone

1069
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,368
check out Nancy bud well on Facebook or

1070
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:41,739
Instagram and she is a representative

1071
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,480
for a specific lighting company and she

1072
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:45,068
has great pictures and she will guide

1073
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,119
you through your purchase of an LED

1074
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:48,279
light if it's something that you're

1075
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,289
really interested in he's got a third

1076
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,550
part to this question it says also

1077
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,289
wondering what are your thoughts on

1078
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,910
hippy buckets and deep water culture

1079
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:58,329
what are the pros and cons and your

1080
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:00,338
likes and dislikes I am not super

1081
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,780
experienced in deep water culture do you

1082
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:03,759
remember our friend from Hawaii that

1083
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,099
dude grew some deep water culture

1084
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,720
buckets and did some great work the

1085
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,849
problem was if something goes wrong

1086
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,068
everything goes wrong if your pump goes

1087
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:13,599
out on that deep water culture pump and

1088
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:16,179
you don't spray for three or four hours

1089
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,670
if it quits spraying all your plants are

1090
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:21,699
gonna die that's the the major dislike

1091
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,800
to it I thought it was awesome our buddy

1092
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:25,149
had 5-gallon deep water culture buckets

1093
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,068
and his plants were taller than me and

1094
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,500
I'm 6 foot 5 and they were putting on

1095
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:31,150
weight they were packing it up the only

1096
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,338
problem is he had a lot of fungus gnats

1097
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,530
all the damn time he could not get rid

1098
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:36,818
of the fungus gnats I've never done it

1099
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,170
myself so I don't have a lot of

1100
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:39,699
experience but that's what our Hawaiian

1101
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,588
friend was experiencing from what I saw

1102
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:43,859
I spent a lot of time researching

1103
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:46,170
different growth method

1104
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,789
and this one scares me because of its

1105
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,670
complexity it's the same thing with

1106
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:53,159
Hydra the more complicated it gets the

1107
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,740
more random things might fail and cause

1108
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,389
your crap just suicide when you were

1109
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:59,549
only gone for six hours that's why I'm a

1110
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:01,889
soil grower yep and honestly soil is

1111
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,680
insanely forgiving and part of the

1112
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:06,179
reasons for that or what make me favor

1113
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,379
it so let's talk about deep water

1114
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,759
culture a little bit because there might

1115
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,890
be people out there going what the hell

1116
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,390
is deep water culture basically deep

1117
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:14,369
water culture is a five gallon bucket

1118
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:16,230
this is just a one you can do multiple

1119
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:17,759
site deep water culture buckets and you

1120
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,289
can have a main bucket that feeds or a

1121
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,440
main reservoir that feeds multiple

1122
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:23,820
buckets but for a one plan deep water

1123
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,829
culture bucket you've got a five gallon

1124
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,330
bucket and then there's a lid type

1125
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:29,039
device that goes on top of the bucket

1126
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,569
but it's got a little mesh basket cut

1127
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,029
out of the center of it and you fill

1128
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,280
that area with rock wool cubes and you

1129
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,410
put not rock will the hydroton clay

1130
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,820
balls unclear boy put your rock your

1131
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,619
clone that's in a rock will you just set

1132
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,840
it in there and then it'll root and the

1133
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,969
roots will hang down inside of that

1134
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,760
5-gallon bucket inside that 5-gallon

1135
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,259
bucket you put a sprayer there are a lot

1136
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,520
of different types of sprayers available

1137
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,680
there are so many different ways to do

1138
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,210
it they sell a circular it's a circle

1139
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,949
sprayer that's got spray jets this

1140
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:58,230
shoots straight up and it's kind of a

1141
00:41:55,949 --> 00:42:01,409
mister type thing so you're misting this

1142
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,280
is essentially a long growth version of

1143
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,230
the auto climber

1144
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,490
yeah it's it's a real big easy cloner as

1145
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,769
basically what it is you would have

1146
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,329
missed those roots from the bottom real

1147
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:11,699
heavily and you put nutrients in the

1148
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,500
water and a lot of oxygen heavily

1149
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,629
oxygenated and nutrient and water

1150
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,670
spraying from the bottom so that those

1151
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,440
roots hang down into that and grow into

1152
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,880
that spring water cuz gravity makes the

1153
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,929
roots want to go down I think gravity

1154
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,640
does I don't know if they just want to

1155
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:25,440
go down or if it's gravity both they may

1156
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,730
just want to do it naturally but so the

1157
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,070
water spraying up onto there and it's

1158
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,690
growing and then I put it on on a timer

1159
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,280
so that it stops every once in a while

1160
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,289
so the roots can kind of dry so that

1161
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,480
they don't rot and then you just keep it

1162
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:38,130
cycling so every like 15 min every 45

1163
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,599
minutes it shuts off for 15 I'll let

1164
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,820
your water cool down so that the pump

1165
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,589
doesn't overheat your water because the

1166
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,940
oxygen pump and the [ __ ] moving it

1167
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,140
pump is gonna make that water huh a lot

1168
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,200
of people throw a chiller in there to

1169
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:50,609
keep that water cool it's a lot of work

1170
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,349
it's a lot of Technology and if one

1171
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,079
piece of all that tech goes wrong your

1172
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,949
whole thing could die yep the production

1173
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,500
is amazing

1174
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,419
it

1175
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,070
the plant seems to really love it when

1176
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,740
everything's humming but it's one of

1177
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,080
those things where if you're setting it

1178
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:07,689
up the one the one bucket version on the

1179
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,610
cheap like that's the quality of the

1180
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:12,550
parts you just require constant

1181
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,380
attention and you have to understand

1182
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:17,200
that you like your plants got a gun to

1183
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,910
its head the hammers [ __ ] one piece

1184
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,529
fails and that trigger gets pulled and

1185
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:25,389
you start over period and that's why I

1186
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:29,470
read that far in the book it was like I

1187
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:30,400
know enough next chapter so mad sorry I

1188
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:32,049
know I couldn't answer a lot of your

1189
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,789
questions but at least I kind of gave

1190
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,530
you the answers that I had I don't know

1191
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:37,539
a lot about monster cropping tell me

1192
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,769
what you you think monster cropping

1193
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:40,570
means cuz if you google it there are

1194
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:42,400
several different takes just cuz it's a

1195
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,960
that's a very common word so let me know

1196
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,720
what you're thinkin I'll talk more about

1197
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,070
that LEDs no experience dude I told you

1198
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,529
what I saw from my friends deep water

1199
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,830
culture we ranted on what I saw from my

1200
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,450
buddy

1201
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,400
called him pineapple Express because

1202
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:56,529
he's from Kauai I used to come all the

1203
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,570
time but as our 4/20 thanks for the

email please send me more emails we will

1205
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:07,030

1206
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:08,980
episode just blank II was staring into

1207
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,510
them I know the rigs looking at me do

1208
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:16,030
you need a dab you want to take some on

1209
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:18,070
the show I did I'm gonna dab the rest of

1210
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,630
what is on this parchment paper this is

1211
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:22,870
some pineapple Jack from our friends at

1212
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:25,329
FX by last quarter gram yeah it's

1213
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,940
probably quarter gram but I'm gonna take

1214
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,650
this and then I think they want to wrap

1215
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,579
up the show after that Mike got anything

1216
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:35,980
pointing it to say just we're gearing up

1217

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,950
registered to vote make sure you know

1220
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,919
what election issues are coming up in

1221
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:47,169
your area take a minute to actually

1222
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,630
research them it's gonna be a hell of

1223
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:53,019
election all the news is focused on the

1224
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,059
circus that is the presidential race and

1225
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:57,099
honestly it's the local stuff that

1226
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,690
really really really matters that's the

1227
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,889
stuff that's really gonna impact your

1228
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:06,460
day to day and that's the CJ today I did

1229
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:09,039
and that's that's the local issue stuff

1230
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,800
of the the things that tend to really

1231
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,679
matter to most people take a minute to

1232
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,160
figure out what those are the local

1233
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:20,949
issues are now set what County voters

1234
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,299
will be voting on one marijuana question

1235
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:24,909
whether or not they want to ban the

1236
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,519
industry city voters will be voting on

1237
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:29,679
three marijuana questions the first one

1238
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,739
do you want to ban the REC industry yes

1239
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:35,319
or no the second question do you want to

1240
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:37,689
allow recreational stores yes or no and

1241
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,519
the third question do you want to tax

1242
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:44,139
those stores is it like four and a half

1243
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:46,239
percent kind of a confusing set of

1244
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:48,819
questions and there's reasons for that

1245
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,739
like a lot of complicated reasons for

1246
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:54,039
all of those three questions and peirong

1247
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:55,779
freddo puebla city voters but you need

1248
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,150
to know which questions which you need

1249
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,350
to know the wording so that you don't

1250
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:03,940
accidentally vote the wrong way and it's

1251
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,829
important that you know that stuff

1252
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,079
regardless of whether you live near me

1253
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,909
or not because whatever the issues are

1254
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,340
in your area they will impact you

1255
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,420
personally make sure you know what's up

1256
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,130
and make sure you vote

1257
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,570
have you gone to your Facebook page your

1258
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,119
Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws

1259
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:21,039
Facebook page and kind of typed in

1260
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,099
guidance on which way to vote since it

1261
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,900
is worded awkwardly there's already a

1262
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:27,849
beautiful infographic that helps with

1263
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,680
that that the pueblos Pope did they've

1264
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:33,579
been doing some amazing cannabis for

1265
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:36,629
John Rodriguez Lisa wheeler and I don't

1266
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:39,069
know the other reporter's name okay

1267
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,360
thanks Lisa wheeler and your colleague

1268
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,140
who are helping us out in the cannabis

1269
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,150
fight not so much that it's just doing

1270
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:49,599
solid honest reporting and when that's

1271
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:52,000
done it leans far to the pro cannabis

1272
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,980
side because that's just the reality you

1273

can be a good reporter it not end up

1274
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:01,030
reporting that truth but know the issues

1275
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:03,039
in your area it's not that difficult

1276
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,780
doesn't take that much time and it's

1277
