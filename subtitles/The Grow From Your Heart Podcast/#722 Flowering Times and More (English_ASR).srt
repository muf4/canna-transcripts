growers for experienced growers it's not

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,680
for my social entertainment during the

192
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,120
pandemic during the quarantine time we

193
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
couldn't go places i would just jump in

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
the discord and hang out and there would

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
always be a dozen cool people in there

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,879

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
to create a podcast from that community

203

00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,279
uh let's jump into this first message

231
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,959
this one came from the man with no name

232
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,198
that makes it easy

233
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,120
this one says hi ross to jeff my

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,919
question is have you ever thought about

235
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,639
making and releasing autoflower versions

236
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,439
uh of for example golden goat sun kissy

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
lis a lot of a uh it says the man he the

238
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,478
man with no name lists several of my

239
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
strains which would make great

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,719
autoflowers then it says i know

241
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,840
i know that with your experience it

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
would be a doable task i am fervently i

243
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,839
don't know if i know what that word i

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,360
can figure out what it means i don't

245
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,478
know if i've ever heard fervent fervor

246
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,399
fervently yeah that's what it says

247
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
awaiting your next new drop i love the

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,639
show i literally have listened to

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,799
probably four or 500 episodes peace and

250
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,480
love your pal and then he does sign it

251
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,319
with his name which we will not reveal

252
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
here on the show shout out to my friend

253
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,440
the man with no name this is a great

254
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,360
question that i do get asked quite often

255
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,800
with all of the new states legalizing

256
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,200
cannabis and all of the new growers

257
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,079
coming on recreational medically and

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,800
even illegally i do get an influx of

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,278
requests for autoflower seeds a lot of

260
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,838
people teach that autos are the way

261
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,360
but i'm not going to discredit

262
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,760
autoflowers what i'm going to say is

263
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
this i am not into autoflowers

264
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,159
autoflowers are not for me the way i

265
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
think about autoflowers is there is a

266
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,240
time a place in an and an environment

267
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
and a situation in which those plants

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
are great for what i am doing for my

269
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,519
goals my desires

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,360
my needs autoflowers are not for me

271
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,879
uh they're great for other people i

272
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,159
always tell one of my favorite stories i

273
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,360
got some weird echo in the headphones i

274
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,958
apologize if that comes through in the

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
recording i will fix it maybe i'll just

276
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,879
keep talking i've got one of my favorite

277
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,959
stories to tell about autoflowers

278
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,559
because a lot of people do discredit and

279
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,000
talk trash about autos but this is a

280
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,239
great thing that i've seen happen with

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,639
autos there was a an illegal cartel grow

282
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
it was a allegedly a mexican cartel grow

283
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,838
they say it was a mexican cartel because

284
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,919
all of the food found at the at the

285
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
campsites was all of the mexican branded

286
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,919
products uh it was all uh mexican you

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
could tell us mexican food and mexican

288
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,199
brands and things like that i'm not even

289
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
trying to generalize and be racist it

290
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
was a mexican cartel grow so they found

291
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,919
this grow in the middle of the national

292
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,560
forest and they were running large

293
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,120
patches of autoflower plants all through

294
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,719
the warm season here in colorado so they

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
had i don't even know this square

296
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
footage but we'll say hypothetically a

297
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,719
quarter of an acre over here that they

298
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
started today then like two weeks later

299
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
start another quarter of an acre and two

300
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,919
weeks later start another quarter of an

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,240
acre and two weeks later start another

302
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,240
quarter and then if they time it right

303
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,919
every two weeks they're now pulling down

304
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,919
a quarter of an acre of ganja because

305
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,360
their autoflowers they'll grow they

306
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,479
don't have to change the sun cycle the

307
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,759
sun doesn't have to do anything

308
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,759
differently those plants are just going

309
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,958
to grow and flower because that's what

310
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,720
they do

311
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,239
if they would have put photo period

312
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
plants up there they would have had to

313
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
wait until nearly halloween maybe a

314
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,759
little bit after halloween here then

315
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,360
they would have harvested all of it at

316
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,360
once and it had been a lot of work

317
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
instead they threw those autos out got

318
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,278
them going got those healthy threw more

319
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
out threw more out got a perpetual cycle

320
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
going then i would assume that every

321
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,600
time you cut down a crop you immediately

322
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,679
sew more seed keep that pattern going if

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,360
you've got an eight or nine wheat crop

324
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,799
and you can get those seeds reliable at

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
eight or nine weeks and you can plant

326
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,399
four squares that turns out about every

327
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,039
two two and a half weeks you're pulling

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
a crop down and if it's um if it's a

329
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,319
mexican cartel pulling down weed they

330
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
don't give a [ __ ] about that extra week

331
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
they want product to chop up put in a

332
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,599
[ __ ] container and send it to

333
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,199
wherever they're making money they don't

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
really care too much about that extra

335
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
week of ripeness their customer isn't

336
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,519
the guy going ah this is this could have

337
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,799
gone another week that's a different

338
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,720
client that's a different customer

339
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,319
altogether so they're probably pulling a

340
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
crop every two weeks out there my point

341
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
is autoflowers do have a beautiful time

342
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,639
and place if the environment situation

343
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,078
is right but it is not for me now let me

344
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,399
answer the main part of the question the

345
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
question was will i ever consider or

346
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,919
would i consider making autoflowers as

347
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,919
some of my popular [ __ ] like the golden

348
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,838
goat they list the sun kiss lemon

349
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,439
jeffrey blueberry butcher and more and

350
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,800
many more it says

351
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
um i do know how to do it essentially

352
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,679
but

353
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,239
that's not for me so the quick answer is

354
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,439
no i will not make autoflowers of my

355
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
stuff

356
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
let me be clear that i said i will not

357
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
that does not mean that in the future i

358
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
wouldn't have i wouldn't work with

359
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
another reputable breeder big up to my

360
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,679
buddy daz at night owl uh he'd be my

361
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,000
first choice um that doesn't mean that i

362
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,719
wouldn't work with somebody to maybe

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
kind of make a fem or an autoflower

364
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
project really all somebody would have

365
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
to do all that dads would have to do dez

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,519
you've got my blessing and my permission

367
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,039
bro maybe uh send me a few or let's

368
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
collab and well dude but if you've got

369
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,719
the seeds you could do this this is how

370
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,799
cannabis works this is the beauty of it

371
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,399
i couldn't stop dazz and i have no

372
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,838
problem with daz if he does this and i

373
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
hope you hear this brother he could take

374
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
one of my strains anything he could buy

375
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,799
a pack of seeds he could find a keeper

376
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,958
he could breed it to his autos and he

377
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,559
could make an auto whatever i've got he

378
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,719
could make auto i don't know auto sun

379
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,958
kiss he could do it he's got the ability

380
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
the skills he's definitely further along

381
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,479
in the autoflower game than i am so he

382
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
would know how to breed it what to look

383
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,399
for how to select it and get it there

384
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,000
more quickly and be a marketable product

385
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,919
if he wanted to do it he totally could

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
do it and i'm gonna say that i'm okay

387
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,719
with that i don't even need to be

388
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
involved if you wanna cut or something

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
bro i'll send you something good so that

390
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,319
you could work uh cut out some steps but

391
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,679
it wouldn't hurt my feelings it wouldn't

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
bother me because i don't make

393
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,000
autoflowers it's not as a business it's

394
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,838
not gonna take away from my business

395
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,679
because i don't make autos my customers

396
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,880
don't maybe they do want autos but

397
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,039
that's not i'm not going to make them

398
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,799
anyway so i'm not going to lose any

399
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,199
sales if somebody makes an auto of my

400
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,879
line because i'm not going to do that

401
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
if i was making autos and somebody else

402
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,639
made an auto of my line and just copied

403
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
my [ __ ] that that's a dick move but i'm

404
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
not going to do it so if somebody else

405
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,759
does that's that's fair game another big

406
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,519
factor of that is i'm not into

407
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,120
autoflowers so i couldn't do it my

408
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,480
theory the name of the podcast is grow

409
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
from your heart i always say grow from

410
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
your heart and breed with love i'm not

411
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,679
in love with autoflowers so i would just

412
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
i wouldn't care it would just be is this

413
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,359
good enough can we just put these out

414
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
and that's not what my brand is known

415
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,959
for irie genetics is known for putting

416
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
out top quality [ __ ] that has been

417
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,799
thoroughly tested my testing is

418
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,799
transparent if you follow my discord

419
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,799
server there's a tab that says irie

420
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,719
genetics testers and i encourage

421
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,039
everybody that gets a test pack of seeds

422
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
from me to go to the discord and post

423
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,919
every picture you can on that server in

424
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,519
the tester tab that way we can see how

425
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,879
many of your seeds sprouted what they

426
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639
look like when they're little how long

427
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,879
you veg them what they flower like how

428
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,039
long they flower the colors the shapes

429
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,639
the textures the trichomes like i

430
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,719
encourage you to post everything if

431
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,159
you're a tester so everything that comes

432
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
from me is bred with love it's

433
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,639
thoroughly tested i know that it is top

434
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
shelf top quality if i were to make auto

435
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
flowers it would just be some [ __ ] that

436
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,199
i slapped together so that all the

437
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
people asking for autoflowers could send

438
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,879
me their money and that's not how uh

439
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,120
that's not how i operate my company to

440
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,039
be successful i make things that i know

441
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,198
are top quality it doesn't go out unless

442
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,278
it is going to be a winner unless i want

443
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,559
to grow it again and again and i'm proud

444
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,078
of it i want to show it off and when

445
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,679
people talk about it they beam and they

446
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,078
light up it doesn't leave here it

447
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,759
doesn't become a product in the catalog

448
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:00,799
it gets tossed it gets forgotten about

449
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,480
so

450
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,799
my favorite way that i could describe it

451
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,720
is if i were going to make autoflowers

452
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,439
it would be like playing in a country

453
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,040
band i could do it i could hit the drums

454
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,880
and it would sound like country music

455
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,000
but it wouldn't feel

456
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,759
like good country music if you got me

457
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,078
playing some reggae music if you got me

458
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,319
playing some some jam rock music or some

459
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,479
straight funk we could get down and it

460
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,639
will feel like reggae music it will feel

461
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,159
like jamrock music you got me playing

462
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,159
rock and roll music in a rock and roll

463
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,919
band it will feel good and it will feel

464
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,838
right but if you want me to play real

465
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,159
country i'm not into it my heart's not

466
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
into it i'll do it for the money

467
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,039
but i'm not going to do it a long time

468
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,559
and it's not going to be the best it

469
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,159
could be there's somebody else out there

470
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,000
that should do that job that's how i

471
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,439
feel about autoflowers

472
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,839
country music is cool if you're into

473
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
that it's just not for me and that's how

474
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
autoflowers are in my opinion i often

475
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
use this analogy

476
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,319
cannabis breeders and selections are

477
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
like music i would obviously be the

478
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,720
[ __ ] reggae side of that coin and

479
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,879
then you got other breeders out there uh

480
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,360
maybe one of those breeders has more of

481
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,120
a uh a death metal vibe and maybe

482
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
another one of those breeders out there

483
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,120
has like a b52s kind of a vibe and maybe

484
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
somebody out there is full on got that

485
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
country music vibe we all find a breeder

486
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
that kind of speaks to us that kind of

487
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,079
connects with us that talks in a way we

488
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
enjoy and makes plants that we enjoy and

489
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,439
if i if i was making autoflowers i

490
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,599
honestly would be lying to you and

491
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
ripping you off and i'm i'm not the uh

492
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,759
the autoflower band if that makes any

493
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,600
sense i've talked enough about that uh

494
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
big up to my buddy the man with no name

495
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,519
i do appreciate that long story short

496
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
brother i will not make the autoflowers

497
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,679
myself but that does not mean that

498
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,919
somebody on my team somebody in the crew

499
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,278
will not make them and we may one day if

500
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,759
they're thoroughly tested and they

501
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,799
qualify and the consumers approve we may

502
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,039
put the ire label on them it will be uh

503
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,599
transparent and well known that i didn't

504
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:57,399
do it that they were bred by a qualified

505
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,120
certified auto flower uh

506
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,639
constructionist i'm trying to find a

507
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
fancy word for that a breeder is where

508
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,278
i'm going all right i'm gonna stop

509
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,078
talking for a minute take a drink then

510
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,078
we're going to read the next email

511
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,678
all right i am back i am hydrated my

512
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,078
voice is lubricated i'm ready to get

513
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
this ramble fest going again i've got an

514
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,558
email here in front of me from somebody

515
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
that uh who's become very uh familiar to

516
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,918
me i see your name in a lot of places if

517
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,240
i'm online i probably see your name

518
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,880
there big up to my buddy dave from

519
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
ontario this message goes a lot like

520
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,120
this it says i was just watching the

521
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,200
thick shells episode i did an episode a

522
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,038
while back about seeds having too thick

523
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,038
of a shell it says i thought i would

524
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,879
contribute a question in case you

525
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,480
thought it might make a good episode

526
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,880
this is a great question for the show i

527
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,558
do like this it says my apologizes if

528
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
there's already an episode on this

529
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,079
subject

530
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,480
i'm gonna ramble on that there's like

531
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,639
700 episodes and i often forget what

532
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
i've done shows about so uh if you have

533
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
a question and you're like you probably

534
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
talked about that don't be afraid i may

535
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,119
have learned something my opinion may

536
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,399
have changed i may have forgotten to say

537
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,439
something on the last time i talked

538
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
about it

539
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
send me your question don't be shy

540
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
because there are 722 episodes i'm not

541
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,798
gonna make you search all the way back

542
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,880
to episode five to find the answer and

543
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,798
if it's like a hundred episodes back

544
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
that's a year right that's yeah that's a

545
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,279
full year my education my theory my

546
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
practices may have fully changed so

547
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,879
re-ask your new question and i may give

548
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,159
you a completely different [ __ ]

549
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
answer than what i gave you last time

550
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,038
you can call me on it you can see the

551
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,839
growth experience

552
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,119
don't be afraid to change but um

553
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,240
yeah so don't be worried if somebody's

554
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,159
already asked the question that you've

555
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,079
got that's cool because most people i've

556
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,759
learned don't really search through the

557
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,199
catalog to find the old stuff they just

558
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,119
ask the question hope for that i'll

559
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,279
answer it now let's get myself on track

560
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,119
here this question from my buddy dave

561
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,839
goes a lot like this it says i am

562
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,159
growing raphael and sun kissed together

563
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,240
my first irie genetics run and i cannot

564
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,679
wait until harvest

565
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,599
that's a great lineup together bro

566
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,440
that's gonna smell so good in that grow

567
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,119
room that's gonna smell like a smoothie

568
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
it's gonna smell like a smoothie shop a

569
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,798
fruit stand ah it's gonna smell like a

570
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,959
good fruit jungle it's gonna be

571
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,359
beautiful in there and you said i can't

572
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,200
wait until harvest bro please wait until

573
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,199
they're done which is a good part of

574
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,038
this uh the question here but a lot of

575
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,759
people say i can't wait bro just wait

576
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,960
set your mind too i am going to wait uh

577
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,519
make it a game that you're going to wait

578
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,200
even longer than you should and then

579
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,119
the psycho the psychology will work out

580
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,319
to recut it down at the right time

581
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,079
a lot of people get too eager and cut

582
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,678
down too early and disappoint themselves

583
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,798
and they say next time i'll go longer do

584
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
it right the first time we'll figure it

585
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,558
out all right there is more to this it

586
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,919
says sun kiss says 50 to 60 days raphael

587
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,918
says 65 to 70 days my question is and i

588
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,880
like this question how accurate would

589
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,400
you consider your flowering times also

590
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
if you could comment on the flowering

591
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
times versus flowering times of other

592
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,559
breeders are yours more accurate in your

593
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
opinion this is such a great question

594
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,079
and a good topic

595
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
it says i would be harvesting sun kiss

596
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,240
on day si or would i be harvesting sun

597
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,759
kiss on day 60 uh would it be

598
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,519
approaching over ripeness what about

599
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,879
harvesting in the 65 70 day range uh and

600
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,839
then similar question here with

601
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,080
harvesting sun kiss on day 50 considered

602
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,519
harvesting too early even though it is

603
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,199
in the range

604
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,639
um all right we've got enough of the

605
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
question figured out i know exactly what

606
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
you're asking this is a really good

607
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
question

608
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,039
there are two parts to the question so

609
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,639
let me jump up and get the first part

610
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,000
how accurate would you consider your

611
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
flowering times and i think that'll

612
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
segue us into a good ramble to answer

613
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,480
this whole question here uh my flowering

614
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,480
times the flowering times which i print

615
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,919
on my website and my official seed

616
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,079
packaging and you will notice that

617
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
sometimes i do go and update the website

618
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,639
because we learn

619
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,320
uh through

620
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,120
uh let's say i put out a hundred test

621
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,279
packs that means i'm gonna get 80 to 90

622
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,359
reports back and if those people tell me

623
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,960
it took nine to ten weeks we're going to

624
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,399
put that on the package but over time

625
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,519
people will buy the product now that

626
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,759
we've released it and now 500 people

627
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,599
will grow it and we'll get the ratio the

628
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,558
options grow now that our test sample is

629
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,639
larger the options for more anomalies

630
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,319
and outliers start popping up and so

631
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,799
sometimes with more test samples with

632
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,720
larger test batches we get more data and

633
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:09,038
we do have to adjust our flowering times

634
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,600
but i do really think that the flowering

635
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,798
times i list on my website are mostly

636
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,038
accurate

637
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,279
that comes from a few things that comes

638
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,879
from me growing the seeds out that comes

639
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,639
from like i said a second ago sending

640
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
the seeds to testers when i make new

641
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
seeds when i have a new batch of seeds

642
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,038
i'm doing it right now you guys have

643
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
heard me i'm looking for testers i'm

644
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,960
auditioning testers if you want to test

645
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,119
seeds let me say this again make sure

646
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,919
you listen to the seed tester episode i

647
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,879
think it is number 590 find that episode

648
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,400
listen to that then the next thing is to

649
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
join the discord and let me know you're

650
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
serious because i will require you to

651
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,640

652
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
if you are a tester where the hell was i

653
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
oh testers everybody likes to test

654
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,079
things i send a lot of test seeds out

655
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,159
i've got a lot of test seeds out there

656
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,480
right now when i get new stuff i send

657
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,480
out testers i'll probably send

658
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
somewhere between 25 and 100 i know

659
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,279
that's a random number but it just

660
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,600
depends on honestly how many of the

661
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,879
seeds i've gotten um

662
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,639
sometimes i can see what i want right

663
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
away sometimes i know exactly what i've

664
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
made sometimes and sometimes i'm like i

665
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
better run that a few more times we've

666
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,079
got one right now that i'm testing that

667
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,918
i had about 20 people say it was looking

668
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,079
good one person came up with a weird

669
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,640
anomaly that i've never seen before and

670
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,798
so i sent out 25 more packs just to see

671
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
like i said numbers maybe maybe somebody

672
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,480
will see that again and then i have more

673
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,759
research more data so we do a lot of

674
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
testing

675
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,720
my testers all have different levels of

676
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
experience uh different environments

677
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,919
different lights different soil

678
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,880
different uh maybe not even soil

679
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,400
different cocoa different hydro

680
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
different nutrients different air

681
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,919
conditioners different filters

682
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
they've got different combinations of

683
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,320
different setups so i let different

684
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
people run the same seeds and then i put

685
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,319
all of that data together i get all of

686
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,918
these grow reports and i'll put all of

687
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,759
the uh we're just going to say that

688
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
right now people are testing let's talk

689
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,519
about one that finished testing just

690
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,678
recently that'll make it more easy for

691
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,158
me to talk about a strain i recently was

692
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
testing bubba kush cross 2 arise it's

693
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
the pre-98 bubba kush the female

694
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,558
pollinated by the male arise king

695
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,558
solomon uh that's it past testing it has

696
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,119
been officially named uh that is the

697
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
moon tower so people were growing that

698
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,399
we sent out a bunch of packs of moon

699
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,918
tower nobody knew what they had they

700
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
were growing that i i got a lot of

701
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,080
feedback people sent me like uh just a

702
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
list of people sent me all their grow

703
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,558
reports i've got it all on uh in an

704
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
email all on discord and i just open up

705
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,678
a little file that says moon tower and

706
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,440
then i'll put your name and then i'll

707
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,320
put all the details that you send me in

708
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,240
a list and then i kind of can do um it's

709
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,720
i can just see commonalities like oh

710
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,880
tall smells like pine cones smells like

711
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
gas makes me lazy gives me the giggles i

712
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
can find the commonalities in there and

713
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,079
that's kind of how we list our

714
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,879
descriptions that is also how i come up

715
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:54,480
with flowering times cannabis is mostly

716
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,960
going to be eight to ten weeks sometimes

717
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,679
rarely less than eight weeks sometimes

718
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,759
10 12 14 16 weeks just depends on what

719
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,159
you've got so i let a bunch of people

720
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,919
run it most of the time they give me

721
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,159
very common reports i get like this one

722
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
was done at 63 or this one was done and

723
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,360
a lot of times getting a tester to go

724
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,798
past 70 days is also a challenge so

725
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,000
that's something that i've got to do

726
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,119
i've got to run those on my own

727
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,278
sometimes

728
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,439
i get a lot of reports and then i kind

729
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,919
of just see like i watch the the flavor

730
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
reports the growth statistics and charac

731
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
characteristics i watch for flowering

732
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,839
times just like i do all those other

733
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,519
feedbacks then i kind of do a lot of

734
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,439
averages if a lot of people say this

735
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
takes nine weeks i will tell you that it

736
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,080
takes nine to ten weeks i try to give

737
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,519
you that extra week because

738
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,119
like i talked about earlier people get

739
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,519
eager and anxious and they cut [ __ ] down

740
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,359
too early and if it takes nine weeks

741
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,879
i'll put ten weeks on that package just

742
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,038
sometimes to encourage you to go that

743
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,960
extra week also sometimes that extra

744
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,599
week is where some of the stuff really

745
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,558
bulks up and beefs up so how accurate

746
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,119
are my flowering times in my opinion in

747
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,359
my experience they are fairly accurate i

748
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,519
do offer a two week range on most of the

749
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,959
packages now let's talk about something

750
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,240
very important

751
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,919
these plants are being grown in

752
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
different environments they mean they

753
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,679
may be grown in a dry climate they may

754
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,200
be grown in a wet climate they may get

755
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,400
over watered underwater overfed underfed

756
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,558
abused loved cherished insulted they

757
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
could get a lot of different [ __ ] every

758
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,319
one of those things i mentioned can

759
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,400
alter the flowering time also phenotype

760
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,839
maybe you got the let's talk about sun

761
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,000
kiss because sun kisses one that could

762
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,639
really this could really happen

763
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,240
that tangy leaning phenotype that's done

764
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,080
in 56 55 days um if you get that more

765
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,278
golden goat leaning phenotype that's a

766
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,960
65 dare so you could have both of those

767
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,359
from the same pack of seeds it's just

768
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
phenotype dependent and a lot of people

769
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,639
really like finding that golden goat

770
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
dominant phenotype it's golden goat with

771
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
oranges on it a lot of people like

772
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,159
finding that tangy phenotype because

773
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,519
it's tangy with golden goat potency and

774
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,880
then somebody's gonna want the one right

775
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,480
in the middle so it's all about finding

776
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
the one that works for you but the point

777
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,360
is

778
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
um the phenotypes are going to make a

779
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,558
difference and a lot of people

780
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,399
don't like the f1s because of the

781
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,839
phenotype variation i love it a lot of

782
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,400
people like that you can find the plant

783
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,720
that is for you so that is why i give

784
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,038
you approximately a two week window

785
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,558
within there are always outliers there

786
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,640
this is nature this is science and

787
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,599
nature coming together uh there will

788
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,240
always be outliers if i say 55 to 65

789
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,719
days there will be 50 day flowers and

790
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,000
there will be 90 day flowers that's just

791
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,798
how genetics are going to work i'm

792
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,720
giving you the best idea that i can

793
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,359
uh always pay attention to the trichomes

794
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,600
always go in my opinion if i told you 70

795
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,759
days if i told you 65 days

796
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,119
in the first run always go to that last

797
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,038
number that's what i encourage i want

798
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,239
you to see what it does let's watch it

799
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,919
see why are you going to cut it down too

800
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,839
early it might bulk up it might get more

801
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
potent it might do some cool [ __ ] might

802
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,038
get some cool colors always go to that

803
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
last part so

804
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,879
how accurate do i consider my flowering

805
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,439
times to be i like to think they're

806
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,520
accurate because i do a lot of testing

807
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
a whole lot of testing

808
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,798
i'm making it very transparent i'm

809
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,400
having a lot of fun making the testing

810
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,400
transparent because you guys can already

811
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,480
see what's coming and it makes people

812
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,679
super excited about it and it builds a

813
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
little bit of hype and a little bit of

814
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,440
mystery i don't tell you what you've got

815
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
when i send you testers but i know i've

816
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,840
got a legend and i'm like oh um our

817
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,678
buddy dave over here is testing product

818
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,439
number five and then i know that you've

819
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
got bubba kush to arise and you don't

820
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,278
know it and i'm just watching you grow

821
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
and comparing yours to lemurs and

822
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,079
lefties and [ __ ] whoever else is

823
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,440
growing whatever i'm just throwing out

824
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,359
random names don't think i just told you

825
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,120
what you've got i made [ __ ] up just now

826
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,719
but i'm comparing notes and watching

827
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,319
pictures and just getting excited for

828
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,839
you and then when everybody's close to

829
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,359
finishing i start telling you what it is

830
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,720
i'm like everybody in this group has the

831
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,639
same stuff and everybody in this group

832
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,640
has the same then we reveal what it is

833
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,880
it's a lot of fun i love the testing so

834
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,038
that is how i determine what to write on

835
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,799
the packages i watch what the testers do

836
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,558
i use their feedback kind of average

837
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,079
that and i know by the male plant and

838
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,079
the female plant what to expect in

839
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,759
flowering time also so i have some

840
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,519
anticipation there

841
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,798
i don't tell the testers how long to let

842
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,960
it flower i tell them let it go till

843
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,119
it's done sometimes like i said it's

844
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,960
hard to let them go past 70 days for a

845
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,278
tester all right so i've answered the

846
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,759
first part how accurate are my flowering

847
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,440
times where do we go from there

848
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,599
um

849
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,080
my flowering times versus other breeders

850
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,599
i can't i'm i don't know

851
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,678
honestly what the other breeders type on

852
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,199
their packages unless i'm buying that

853
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,159
seed pack and running if that's not my

854
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
business

855
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
literally not my business i'm going to

856
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,759
focus on what i read genetics does and

857
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,038
we're not going to praise or bash any

858
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,558
other company

859
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,079
um

860
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,038
yeah we'll just leave it at that i don't

861
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,960
know what other breeder i don't know

862
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,200
what they're doing it's not my business

863
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
quite literally um so then you're

864
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,679
talking about would harvesting sun kiss

865
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,038
on day 60 be approaching over ripeness

866
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,399
all right

867
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,000
this is where

868
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,599
i'm going to say

869
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,640
this is going to be plant-specific i

870
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,240
don't know your grow i don't know what

871
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,919
you're doing i don't know how hot cold

872
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,319
dry wet humid overfed underfed abused

873
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,520
loved kissed lollipop defoliated

874
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,519
overheated

875
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,879
um stressed

876
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,519
dark interrupted i don't know what

877
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,559
you've got going on in there so i really

878
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,359
would say

879
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,960
watch every single plant you can't just

880
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,278
so if you've got a pack of sun kiss and

881
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,798
a pack of strawberry starburst you can't

882
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,240
just say the strawberries are done at

883
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,639
one day and the sunkists are done at

884
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,640
another you've got to watch every single

885
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,240
plant in there and pay attention to each

886
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,960
one i know that is probably not the

887
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,319
answer you want but that is it's the way

888
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,798
it's got to be done if you want

889
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,038
perfection now in a commercial grow

890
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,038
environment um

891
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,599
i would take all these to 65 days

892
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,359
probably six about 60 65 days and then

893
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,719
just chop them because in a commercial

894
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,558
environment it's in a commercial

895
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,440
environment most of the time we go uh

896
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,960
nine weeks 63 days unless it's uh unless

897
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,679
the owners are really cool then you go

898
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,880
seven we are 70 days the 10 weeks but in

899
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,798
a commercial grow these would probably

900
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,440
all come down at the end of week nine to

901
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,000
be honest with you what i would do

902
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,038
um i would find if you want to run these

903
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,119
together

904
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,398
this is the inaugural run this is your

905
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,000
first date i would find um find two that

906
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,278
work well together something just went

907
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,319
wrong with that [ __ ] camera we're

908
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,519
gonna have to finish the whole episode

909
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,879
on this one we're gonna wrap it up quick

910
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,440
that camera just took a [ __ ] [ __ ] you

911
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,760
camera one um i hope i got this so let's

912
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
keep going um i would find phenotypes

913
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,919
that work well together and grow them

914
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,759
together or find phenotypes that are

915
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,520
completely opposite that complement each

916
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,720
other and run them you can grow them at

917
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,240
the same time that's not a problem

918
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
you're just gonna have to time it when

919
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,319
it comes time to flushing which will be

920
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,840
cool because uh that will save you on

921
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,599
the headache of trimming if you've got

922
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,000
the raphael that comes down closer to

923
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,000
day 70 and the sun kiss that comes down

924
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
closer to day 50 that's hypothetical

925
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,759
that gives you nearly three weeks of dry

926
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
cure and trim time you could almost get

927
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,839
one down

928
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,679
dry it trim it get it in the jars to get

929
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,839
cured then get it into wherever it goes

930
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,440
for storage before you even cut down the

931
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,240
other batch you could have a nice

932
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,480
perpetual harvest without having one

933
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
harvest at one time and a perpetual grow

934
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,319
all right this podcast got shorter than

935
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,359
i intended it for it to be because i

936
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,720
don't know what happened to that camera

937
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,079
honestly you guys it's plugged in

938
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,759
