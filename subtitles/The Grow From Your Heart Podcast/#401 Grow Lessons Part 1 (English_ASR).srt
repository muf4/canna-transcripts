point five percent total cannabinoids

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,128
you guys this concentrate is just

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,020
ridiculous I'm taking the lid off the

15
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:59,789
jar right now give it a little smell I

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,520
don't even have to get it close to my

17
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,859
face it smells like ridiculous gas and

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,719
rotten fruit and it is deliciously

19
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,129
amazing it kind of almost makes your

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,868
eyes kind of itch a little bit when you

21
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,769
smell it real hard this stuff is

22
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,709
delicious

23
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,289
the color and consistency are ridiculous

24
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:18,059
it's kind of like shiny yellow diamonds

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,080
I know diamonds are supposed to be clear

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,909
but it's kind of like some shiny

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,859
citrine's I guess this stuff is

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,478
beautiful and I think you can tell by

29
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,819
the early show rambles that this

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,890
concentrate is amazing so big shout out

31
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,758
to my friends at apothecary farms for

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,859
the delicious star guava HC FS e if

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,569
you've been following the podcast for a

34
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,879
while you know that a while back I did a

35
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,008
really long grow series that started at

36
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,989
making a solid strategy and plan for our

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,810
grow and ended with sampling our

38
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,030
finished product I got a great response

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,920
to that grow series when I did the

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,599
series there were several episode

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,640
interruptions because a lot of great

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,618
things came up Mike came over and wanted

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,899
to hang out there was news to report so

44
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,819
the lessons were kind of broken up I

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,879
thought it would be a good idea to

46
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,368
combine those lessons into really long

47
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,179
episodes so this will be the first

48
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,949
compilation of grow lesson episodes this

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,830

51
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,200

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,360

84
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,389
series of episodes that run my listeners

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,729
from the very beginning of a grow all

86
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,439
the way to the very end of a grow I want

seeds and cutting clones all the way

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,670
through the veg phase all the way to

91
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,959

95
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,709

101
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,060
of trouble and avoid common mistakes

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,620
people make when setting up a new grow

I've got a solid intro laid down I'm

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,649
gonna press pause I'm gonna take a

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,660
couple of dabs while you grab a notebook

106
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:40,109
and when we get back we're gonna talk

107
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,939

108
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,100
right podcast rolled I am back I am well

110
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,090
grabbed a pen and some paper because

111
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,399
there will be a lot of information in

112
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,219
this episode let's get into planning

113
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,929
your new garden before we start shopping

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,700
for lights and seeds and planning for

115
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,709
your first harvest there are a few

116
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,969
things you can do to make your growing

117
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,799
experience more enjoyable the FIR

118
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,750
piece of advice I have for anybody who

119
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,480
is planning to start a new grow is to

120
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,970
buy grow books from reputable grow

121
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,970
authors authors I can recommend our ed

122
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,420
Rosenthal or his servantes Greg green

123
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,280
Robert Connell Clarke and drew West now

124
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,009
the second piece of advice is to open

125
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,589
those books and read them I recommend

126
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,689
you read the whole book before you start

127
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:29,629
growing that way you know what to expect

128
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,519
before problems arise that way if the

129
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,870
problem does pop up you know what you've

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,909
got because you've seen it in the book

131
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,410
you know how to diagnose it you know how

132
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,689
to treat it that way you don't make the

133
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,400
problem worse by diagnosing the problem

134
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,680
under pressure and making the wrong

135
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,620
decision so get yourself a grow book

136
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,560
from a reputable grower and read that

137
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,350
book once again I liked and Rosenthal or

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,930
his servantes Greg green Robert Connell

139
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,330
Clarke drew West there are a ton of

140
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,920
great cannabis authors out there reading

141
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,689
books will give you an idea of what to

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,910
expect and you'll have an eye for things

143
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:05,060
when they pop up you won't have as many

144
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,760
surprises you can find books from most

145
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,918
of the authors I listed on Amazon you

146
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,399
can also find a lot of great free PDF

147
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,629
files if you do a quick Google search

148
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,969
another great way to increase your

149
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,490
cannabis knowledge is by listening to

150
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,860
cannabis podcasts if you're a new grower

151
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,230
I recommend shows like the dude grows

152
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,870
and free weed if you're an advanced

153
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,970
grower I recommend shows like cannabis

154
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,879
cultivation and Sciences and shaping

155
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,060
fire another great way to learn about

156
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,610
cannabis is through YouTube there are a

157
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,410
lot of great cannabis YouTube channels

158
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,160
out there but you don't have to watch

159
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,930
cannabis specific videos to learn about

160
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,120
growing you can watch basic plant

161
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,639
biology and basic horticulture videos

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,560
and most of that is going to apply to

163
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,849
your cannabis gardens to learn about the

164
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,949
plants learn about the way that they

165
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:58,160
function and learn why they do what they

166
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,439
do through those YouTube videos one

167
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,050
thing I would avoid is cannabis forums

168
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,730
there is a lot of crap in cannabis

169
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,680
forums that's part of why I started this

170
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,169
show I saw people giving terrible advice

171
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,660
on cannabis forums and I wanted to come

172
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:12,978
on here and correct that so be really

173
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,689
careful if you're taking advice from

174
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:16,099
cannabis forums

175
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,660
I would recommend you avoid them

176
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,340
completely and stick with books podcasts

177
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,370
and YouTube channels from reputable

178
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,169
growers so my first piece of advice is

179
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,360
to buy and read grow books from

180
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,520
reputable growers then supplement that

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
education with knowledge from YouTube

182
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,370
and podcasts now before we go too much

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,769
further with our plans to grow we've got

184
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,500
some things to consider an important

185
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:44,120
thing to think about is legality is it

186
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,029
legal to grow where you're planning to

187
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,889
set up if it is illegal I can't

188
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,250
recommend you grow there I've got to

189
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,769
tell you to obey the laws if you do

190
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,230
choose to grow in an illegal area keep

191
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:59,599
in mind you are now committing a crime

192
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,270
that could result in a life-changing

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,750
experience for you your family and

194
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:07,729
everyone in that household if you were

195
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,519
suspected of running an illegal grow in

196
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,340
your home the police possibly the SWAT

197
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:16,129
team possibly the DEA will kick in your

198
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,229
door and drag you and your family into

199
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:20,899
your front lawn and your underwear while

200
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,840
they destroy your entire house they go

201
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:26,299
through everything they will take all of

202
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,399
your money they'll take your firearms if

203
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,668
you have any they will probably shoot

204
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,799
your dog they may shoot you if your

205
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:35,659
family is home they will be detained and

206
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,659
possibly shot if they don't react

207
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,750
properly to police instructions your

208
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,419
house is now a drug house they come in

209
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,460
ready for war your wife and kids will

210
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:49,039
never forget the morning the door came

211
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,410
off an armed man came in and took you to

212
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,829
jail and destroyed the house your life

213
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:57,049
will never be the same think about this

214
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,150
before you choose to set up I know that

215
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:01,279
sounds dramatic it is dramatic and it

216
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,220
will be traumatic for you and everyone

217
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,949
involved I can't stress this enough

218
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,200
think about this before you hang up your

219
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,320
grow lights think about this before you

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,650
order your seeds also keep in mind that

221
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,000
you are producing a high-value product

222
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,100
start thinking now about what you're

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,110
going to do if somebody tries to come in

224
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,050
your home and take that from you while

225
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,089
you are there think about it now so that

226
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:27,349
you know what you're getting into before

227
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,210
the time table

228
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,960
now that I've made that important

229
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,910
disclaimer let's move forward let's

230
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,590
think about why you were growing are you

231
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:39,199
going to supply yourself are you going

232
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,850
to supply a family member are you trying

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
to be the next neighborhood hookup are

234
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,710
you trying to be the next Pablo Escobar

235
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,980
of cannabis think about the real reason

236
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,590
for your grow and have a goal in mind if

237
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,019
your goal is to supply yourself think

238
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,629
about how much product you need every 60

239
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:59,120
to 90 days and set up a grow it will

240
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,129
supply that for yourself plus maybe a

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,970
little extra in case you have an issue

242
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:06,889
or a delay in your next cycle growing

243
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,230
enough product to supply yourself should

244
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,970
be an easy goal growing enough to supply

245
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,779
the whole neighborhood is when it starts

246
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,210
to get risky

247
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,980
every time you hang up another light you

248
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,650
increase your chances of trouble

249
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,750
exponentially in my opinion so think

250
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,179
about the risks involved before you

251
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,820
expand and I always recommend starting

252
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:28,669
small learning how to grow and then

253
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,560
expand from there so think about what

254
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:33,979
you realistically expect from your grow

255
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,719
and set a goal for yourself your grow is

256
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,850
going to be limited by the amount of

257
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,500
space you have the amount of equipment

258
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,509
you have and also the amount of

259
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,659
electricity you can provide to that

260
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:47,179
space one of your goals is to figure out

261
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:49,360
how to maximize the yield from the

262
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:52,159
amount of space you have got a

263
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,680
reasonable goal is one pound per

264
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,049
thousand watt light and a thousand watt

265
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,779
light usually is good for about a four

266
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:02,389
by four to a five by five space so you

267
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:05,209
would expect about one pound per every

268
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,879
four by four or five by five foot space

269
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,710
now don't expect that right away you've

270
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,299
got to learn how to grow you've got to

271
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,040
learn the genetics you've got to learn

272
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,929
your nutrients and you've got to dial in

273
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,969
the room but to give you guys an

274
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,620
estimate and help you design and set up

275
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,250
your room and understand how to reach

276
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,909
your goals

277
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,009
you can reasonably expect one pound per

278
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,629
thousand watt light once you get good at

279
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,610
growing now once you really get good at

280
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:30,740
growing you should increase that goal to

281
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,210
closer to two pounds per light and if

282
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,220
you move into the double-ended bulb

283
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,680
technology you can certainly increase

284
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,360
your expectations much more with more

285
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,709
lighting of course all of what I'm

286
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,879
talking about is with hyper

287
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,310
or sodium lighting high-intensity

288
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,740
discharge lighting I do not have enough

289
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:48,979
experience with LEDs to give you any

290
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,019
estimates or expectations and again this

291
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,330
is all just rough expectations rough

292
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,669
estimates about a pound per thousand

293
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,400
watt light is your general goal once you

294
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,990
learn how to grow don't focus too much

295
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,169
on yields when you're getting started

296
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,029
focus more on learning the needs of the

297
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:07,159
plant understanding the cycles of the

298
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,990
plant and learning how to see what the

299
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,669
plants are telling you focus more on

300
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,769
that when you get started then the

301
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,750
yields will come the quality will come

302
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,970
when you develop a relationship with the

303
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,620
plant everything will fall into place so

304
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,480
learn how to grow I'm just giving you a

305
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,509
rough idea of what you can expect once

306
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,370
you get dialed in now let's get back on

307
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,620
track with things we need to think about

308
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,120
when planning are a grow the next thing

309
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,129
I've got written down as safety and

310
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,320
security we're gonna talk about that in

311
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,330
detail in the next episode which is

312
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,190
going to be selecting and planning your

313
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,350
space this is going to be overall

314
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,810
planning your grow the next episode will

315
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,070
focus more in on your space so for

316
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,289
safety and security we're gonna go

317
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,450
quickly you need to worry about the law

318
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,649
I already talked in depth about that you

319
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,180
need to worry about thieves and

320
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,340
criminals I already talked a little bit

321
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:54,469
about that so safety and security will

322
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,620
be discussed more in the next episode

323
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,320
another thing I've got is water is water

324
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,320
accessible and affordable where you plan

325
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,379
to grow also do you have an excuse for

326
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,600
the extra water consumption the next

327
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,580
thing on the list is electricity when

328
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,220
you're planning your grow keep in mind

329
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,590
that you will be very limited by the

330
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,680
amount of electricity you can pull from

331
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,509
a home most homes have a one or two

332
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,669
hundred amp service depending on your

333
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:25,460
location if you've only got a hundred

334
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,809
amp service you will be very limited on

335
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,580
how many lights you can run if you've

336
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:31,189
got two hundred amps of service you'll

337
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,720
still be limited in my experience when

338
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,550
they put the electricity in your house

339
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,790
they did not consider you adding

340
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:39,529
thousand watt grow lights they put just

341
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,179
enough for you to run all of the

342
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,339
appliances and things in your house and

343
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,779
also plug in the blow dryer and the

344
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,730
microwave they don't give you a lot of

345
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,769
extra amperage because they never

346
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,620
thought you were going to plug in these

347
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,299
high-powered devices so you're going to

348
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,600
be limited by the amount of electric

349
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:59,509
before you go out and buy 4,000 watt

350
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,460
lights maybe by 2 and plug them both in

351
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,009
and see if you start flipping breakers

352
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,340
I'm sure you won't be able to plug in 2

353
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,319
1000 watt lights into the same

354
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,730
receptacle in one room that little plug

355
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,470
in right there it's got the plug-in on

356
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,700
top to plug in on the bottom you got

357
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,110
your phone plugged into one you got the

358
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,690
computer plugged into the other you

359
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,730
cannot plug in 2 1000 watt lights into

360
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,230
that that will flip the breaker you're

361
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,370
gonna run out to the garage or wherever

362
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,899
you're gonna flip the breaker you're

363
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,490
gonna make it come on again it's gonna

364
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,039
start heating up the receptacle it's

365
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,230
gonna blow the receptacle or it's gonna

366
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,750
catch the wires on fire don't try to

367
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,879
plug in 2 thousand watt lights into the

368
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,279
same plug in you might not even be able

369
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,529
to run 2 1000 watt lights in the same

370
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,049
room if both of the plug ins are on the

371
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:45,259
same breaker most of the breakers in

372
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:48,620
your house are going to be 10 amps maybe

373
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,360
20 amps and maybe 35 amps if you're

374
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,350
really lucky older homes are gonna have

375
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,629
tens and twenties

376
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,659
more modern homes you may have up to 35

377
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:59,840
breakers most of our thousand watt grow

378
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:01,969
lights pull about 8 to 11 amps when they

379
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,710
fire up they want to pull 11 amps to get

380
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,350
started as they're running they'll drop

381
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,850
down to around 7 or 8 amps so you have

382
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,860
to keep that in mind when you're

383
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,529
designing and thinking about your grow

384
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,169
how much amperage is available in the

385
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,789
space in which you plan to grow and

386
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,899
don't expect to run a bunch of extension

387
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,069
cords because they're gonna get hot

388
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,240
they're gonna melt they're gonna catch

389
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,129
on fire they're gonna start flipping

390
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,080
breakers that's going to cause more

391
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,149
problems just realize that you either

392
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,850
need to upgrade the electrical or you

393
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:30,620
need to settle for less lights also keep

394
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,409
in mind that for every light you hang

395
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,480
you probably need a blower or a fan or

396
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:38,629
some sort of electricity so I allow

397
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,070
extra amperage for your accessories and

398
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,539
you've also got to run the house you

399
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,310
have to turn on lights in the

400
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,839
refrigerator and what if somebody tries

401
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,579
to run the microwave and it blows up the

402
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,850
whole grow keep that sort of stuff in

403
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,580
mind don't burn down the house with your

404
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,040
bro so we'll talk more about electricity

405
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,560
in the selecting your space episode as

406
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,990
well also airflow you're gonna need

407
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,369
airflow we will talk in depth about air

408
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,700
flow in the next episode trash you guys

409
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,070
people don't consider how much trash

410
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,500
they will create when they are building

411
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,379
and running a grow you're gonna have

412
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,090
boxes that say high pressure sodium grow

413
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:18,009
light on them you're gonna have to think

414
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,320
about how to get rid of that discreetly

415
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,639
you'll have empty nutrient bottles that

416
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,340
you need to figure out how to get rid of

417
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,689
discreetly then when we harvest we've

418
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,240
got to figure out how to get rid of that

419
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,740
old root ball all the sticks and all of

420
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,720
that dirt so that's something to start

421
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,690
thinking about before we start buying

422
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,430
grow lights and buying our seeds another

423
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,590
thing to think about is the odor and

424
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,599
aroma of your grow you don't want to

425
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,019
snitch on yourself by having a stinky

426
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,879
garden if you do a good job your plants

427
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,340
are going to stink you will need some

428
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,620
sort of carbon filtration to prevent the

429
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,350
whole neighborhood from smelling your a

430
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,210
grow something a lot of people don't

431
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,970
think about is when you start cutting

432
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,110
down here first grow it really stinks

433
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,730
when you start chopping into those

434
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,100
plants you start breaking open the turps

435
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,410
that's when it really stinks if you

436
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,839
thought it smelled good around week 6 7

437
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,670
&amp; 8 wait till you cut them down and you

438
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,199
start chopping into them that's when

439
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,450
it's really gonna stink so be prepared

440
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,910
for that harvest stink

441
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,769
also at harvest time you've got to think

442
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,290
about that trash you've got to think

443
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:22,569
about all that soil and then you've got

444
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,899
a lot of herb to learn how to dry and

445
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,609
cure and store how are you going to dry

446
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,410
it how are you going to cure it yep

447
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,479
space for that where are you going to

448
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,980
store it do you have space for that so

449
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,890
those are things to start thinking about

450
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,730
before you hang up any lights and buy

451
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,870
any seeds now here is a huge thing to

452
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,120
think about when you're planning your

453
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:45,339
grow what kind of nutrients are you

454
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,019
going to use are you going to go organic

455
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:49,480
or are you going to go

456
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:52,029
synthetic are you gonna go a living soil

457
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,360
or are you gonna go Coco are you gonna

458
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:57,339
do no-till are you gonna do hydro all of

459
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,519
that stuff is up to you you've got a lot

460
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:02,109
of decisions to make everything has its

461
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,599
advantage and everything has its

462
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,969
disadvantage through this long series of

463
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,849
episodes I will try to go over the pros

464
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,789
and cons of organic and synthetic of

465
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:15,549
hydro and soil I'll talk about cocoa

466
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,529
I'll talk about dirt I will try to talk

467
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:20,059
about all of that stuff and help you

468
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,859
make those decisions but now's the time

469
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,990
start thinking about it do you want to

470
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:26,629
go organic do you want to go synthetic

471
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,599
along with that decision comes pest

472
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,790
control integrated pest management do

473
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,980
you want to apply spray applications of

474
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:36,470
pesticides do you want to use predator

475
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,750
bugs all of these options have their

476
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,089
pros and cons and they're all up to you

477
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,759
you'll need to find a pest management

478
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:45,649
system that also works with your

479
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,539
nutrient system if you're running a full

480
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,910
organic system you don't want to go in

481
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,069
there and apply a toxic pesticide that

482
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,440
could disrupt the environment you spent

483
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:56,539
so much time creating so one of your

484
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,029
major things to think about will be your

485
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:01,849
medium do you want to run soil soilless

486
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,720
mix coco perlite do you want to run rock

487
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,419
wool cubes

488
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,519
it is all up to you along with that

489
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,170
decision you get to decide what you're

490
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,819
going to feed those plants do you want

491
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,470
to go all organic do you want to go full

492
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,439
synthetics do you want to do a combo

493
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,930
that is up to you then another major

494
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,269
part of that decision is how you are

495
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,880
going to prevent pests it will all work

496
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,980
together your medium your nutrients and

497
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,100
your integrated pest management will all

498
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,380
become one big unit so think about that

499
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:33,319
in-depth before you make any decisions

500
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,600
and again as this series continues I

501
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,970
will do a lot of discussions on most of

502
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,730
those topics and try to guide you and I

503
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,799
will try to remain unbiased I will talk

504
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,710
about how I grow and I will also try to

505
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,139
give you unbiased information on other

506
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,840
options and other methods that will work

507
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,150
just as well as the way I have chosen to

508
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,039
grow you guys that's part of the beauty

509
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,690
of setting up your own grow nobody can

510
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,039
tell you what to do there's no right or

511
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,049
wrong way the wrong way is when your

512
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,730
plants die the right way is when you

513
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,589
were happy and you're getting what you

514
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,410
want out of the grow if it's producing

515
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:08,929
the quality the amount and you're

516
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,700
satisfied you're doing it correctly you

517
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,230
could probably improve a little bit but

518
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,759
you're doing it right and nobody can

519
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,009
tell you you're doing it wrong if you're

520
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,180
happy with it it's your grow like I said

521
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,859
you're doing it wrong when the plants

522
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,039
die or when you get a bunch of bugs but

523
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:24,109
it's your grow make yourself happy now

524
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,500
once you put a lot of thought into your

525
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:29,299
medium your nutrients your pest control

526
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,430
and if you want to go organic or

527
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,798
synthetic a few more things you should

528
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,528
think about are do you want to grow

529
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,048
seed or from clone I will do in-depth

530
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:41,450
episodes in the very near future on the

531
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:43,788
advantages and disadvantages of starting

532
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,950
from seed or clone and then I will also

533
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:48,109
talk about how to sprout seeds it will

534
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,629
also do episodes on cutting clones so I

535
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:52,398
will go in-depth on that subject but

536
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:54,349
start thinking about that now do you

537
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:57,439
want to grow from seed or do you want to

538
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:59,628
grow from clone so those are a bunch of

539
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,119
great things to think about before you

540
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:03,230
even buy a grow light buy a grow book

541
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:05,329
and read it

542
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,460
find more podcast if you find

543
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:09,858
educational and entertaining and listen

544
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,358
to those podcasts then maybe find some

545
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:14,178
YouTube channels to teach you about

546
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:15,678

547
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,499
your free time and get a good

548
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,139
understanding of the plant then you've

549
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:23,450
got a lot of other things to think about

550
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:25,969
legalities safety and security water

551
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,038
electricity do you have a good excuse

552
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,868
for how much electricity you're about to

553
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,378
start consuming that's something to

554
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,959
think about

555
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:35,298
think about your trash think about the

556
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,899
aroma you're going to create then you

557
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:41,319
get to make that big debate nutrients

558
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:45,678
medium organic versus synthetic and

559
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:48,108
pesticides to think about seeds are

560
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,769
clones that is a lot of stuff to have on

561
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,960
your mind

562
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:53,569

678
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:11,778
taking dad's of Durban cook sauce from

679
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:14,959
contraband concentrates this is labeled

680
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:16,729
as Durban poison and i-95 cross to pre

681
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,190
98 bubba kush i don't know if that's a

682
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:21,950
blend or if that's actually a cross it

683
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,950
is labeled as sweet-and-sour it is a cut

684
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,048
above bread selected and grown this is

685
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,969
really delicious concentrate it kind of

686
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:30,648
gives you that mind eraser sort of a

687
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:33,259
thing you go blank for a few minutes it

688
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:35,358
got mike ridiculously high earlier today

689
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,868
there is a lab test printed on the

690
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:40,668
container

691
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:42,738
it says THC a 900 and 2.9 milligrams

692
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:45,649
which equals ninety point three percent

693
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:47,358
the THC is twenty one point four three

694
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:49,248
milligrams which equals two point one

695
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:51,648
percent and there are no other

696
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:54,229
cannabinoids detected the Durbin Kirsch

697
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:56,088
sauce from contraband concentrates it's

698
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,369
got me lit up I really like this

699
00:26:56,088 --> 00:27:01,999
energetic talkative buzz this should be

700
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:04,488
a fun podcast this episode will be the

701
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:06,200
second in a series of grow lessons it

702
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:08,239
will take us from the beginning of a

703
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,190
grow all the way up to harvest and

704
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:11,960
drying and curing our product in the

705
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,430
last episode we talked a little bit

706
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,289
about planning our grow

707
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,630
setting goals and finding ways to stay

708
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,549
out of trouble in this episode we're

709
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:23,300
going to focus more on planning the

710
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:25,519
specific grow space I've got a lot of

711
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:27,259
details written down for this episode so

712
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm gonna press pause I'm gonna take a

713
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,190
quick drink of course I'm gonna take a

714
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,829
bunch more dad and when I come back

715
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,269
we'll take a deep dive into selecting

716
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,269
and planning your grow space

717
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,090
all right podcast well I am back and I

718
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,640
am ready to talk about selecting your

719
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:53,859
gross space let's get right into it

720
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,500
you can set up a grow almost anywhere if

721
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:59,439
you can supply electricity air flow and

722
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,809
water to that space where you choose to

723
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,279
grow is going to determine a lot of your

724
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,289
setup we talked about this in the last

725
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,450
episode if you're in a small closet

726
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:09,970
you'll be very limited but you'll still

727
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,710
be able to produce a usable product if

728
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,049
you're in a prohibition state you'll

729
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,539
need to take extra precautions to keep

730
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:19,029
the aroma down and also you'll need an

731
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:22,029
excuse for the extra electrical

732
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,859
consumption let me make a quick

733
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,289
disclaimer that I cannot endorse

734
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:28,659
encourage or promote you to conduct any

735
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,759
sort of illegal activity you've got to

736
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,400
follow the laws and obey all of the

737
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,680
rules if you didn't listen to the last

738
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,170
episode please go back and listen to

739
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,970
that long passionate rant I gave about

740
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,160
what will happen to you if you were

741
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,710
suspected of having an illegal grow in

742
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,720
your home now let's keep going I

743
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,549
recommend everyone do your best to

744
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,210
minimize odor and obvious signs of a

745
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:53,859
grow even in legal environments thieves

746
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,809
know how to spot a grow and you're

747
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:58,959
entering a gray area that until recently

748
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:01,149
has been run by criminals you're

749
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,549
planning to produce a high-value product

750
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,200
and people want that product if you tell

751
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:08,200
somebody about that product you are

752
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,390
asking for trouble so be careful in the

753
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,450
last episode I talked about not bragging

754
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,820
keep yourself protected by keeping your

755
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,450
mouth shut now let's talk more about

756
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:21,490
places to grow we can grow in closets we

757
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,830
can grow in pre-made tents we can grow

758
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,750
in bedrooms we can set up giant areas in

759
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,250
basements and we can even use tiny

760
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,839
spaces like our friends love for the

761
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,880
plant and love for the bong they grow in

762
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,039
little micro grows the size of your

763
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,230
space and the pre-existing structure

764
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,349
will dictate most of your setup

765
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,599
especially in a rental home and even

766
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:42,639
more so in a Prohibition environment if

767
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:44,109
you own your home or if you're busting

768
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,690
out the barn or if you're building out a

769
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:50,589
warehouse in a legal area you have much

770
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:52,720
more options ideal spaces for a grow are

771
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,189
generally places with low traffic and

772
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,589
something you can keep hidden from

773
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,250
visitors I like basements for home

774
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:59,649
groves

775
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,929
addicts are okay but they're harder to

776
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,490
keep the climate dialed in the Sun is

777
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:06,009
beating right on top of your gross space

778
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,740
and the home heat rises so attics are

779
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:10,119
generally warmer places maybe my East

780
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,460
Coast friends would have better luck in

781
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,199
the Attic while the Colorado crew will

782
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,269
get down in the basement better

783
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,480
basements usually insulated by the earth

784
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:21,429
so the temperature stays fairly cool if

785
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,769
you can isolate a small section or a

786
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:26,500
room in the basement that is usually my

787
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:28,690
first choice people won't be down in

788
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,880
your basement unless you invite them so

789
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,159
it's easier to keep it secure now the

790
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,960
only issue with basements is when you

791
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,820
have to have a contractor come fix the

792
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,370
water heater or the heater or some sort

793
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:42,399
of plumbing down there you may need to

794
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:45,399
be prepared for visitors so basements

795
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,559
and attics are ideal in my opinion spare

796
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,030
bedrooms are great if you have good

797
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,798
control of your home if you live with

798
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,899
other people you have to make sure that

799
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,359
everyone is on the same page with the

800
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,909
importance of security and light control

801
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,439
and your grow rooms if you live with

802
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,179
other people and you've got a grow room

803
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,529
and a spare bedroom there's a good

804
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:04,360
chance that when you're gone when you're

805
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,740
on a date when you're asleep they're

806
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,359
gonna take somebody in there and show

807
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,500
off your grow and they're gonna do

808
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,149
something weird they're gonna turn on

809
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,038
the light during the night cycle they're

810
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,929
gonna leave that the overhead light on

811
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,339
and not think about the light the normal

812
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,288
room light when the grow lights go off

813
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:19,240
that normal light will stay on they're

814
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:22,000
gonna screw it up so have everybody in

815
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,669
the house on the same page if you set up

816
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,829
a grow in a shared home in a shared room

817
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:29,919
with other folks so be careful with that

818
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:32,829
sort of stuff another thing to think

819
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,809
about is keeping children out of the

820
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:36,460
grow without supervision if you let your

821
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:37,779
kids help that's up to you as a parent

822
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,460
that's up to you as a caregiver maybe

823
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,408
you're growing for the child I think if

824
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,788
you're growing for a child it's great to

825
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,110
have that child go in there and help

826
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:46,119
with their medicine they can build a

827
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:47,949
relationship with it I think that is a

828
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,569
beautiful thing that's up to you as a

829
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,480
parent you parent the way you feel you

830
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:54,279
should do it but keep the drill room

831
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,048
locked and keep the kids out without

832
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,210
supervision I'd recommend a locked

833
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:00,129
anyway just to make law enforcement

834
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,470
happy if anyone does come to inspect

835
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,030
your illegal grow a lock just makes you

836
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,730
look like you're trying to be more

837
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:11,019
responsible it looks good it's an easy

838
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:12,759
step to take do that garage is an out

839
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,980
buildings are also great places for

840
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,289
groves any space in which you can

841
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,349
control the lights the temperature and

842
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:22,299
humidity you can turn into aggro if you

843
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:24,549
have a large space and you can't control

844
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:27,369
the large area you can buy a grow tent

845
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,349
of almost any size and set that up in a

846
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,689
room to create a more controllable

847
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,089
environment you can also set up multiple

848
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,269
tents to have multiple cycles in the

849
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:39,099
same basement or room area you can have

850
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:41,500
a veg area and two tents with

851
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:44,349
alternating flower cycles to maximize

852
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,779
the productivity of a basement grow it's

853
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:49,329
all about maximization once you get your

854
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:52,000
rooms dialed in you can maximize a

855
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:55,210
closet or a cabinet or a warehouse if

856
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,940
you set it up correctly be sure to keep

857
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,670
safety and security in mind is your new

858
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,830
grow option safe is it secure and once

859
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,779
again can you handle the consequences if

860
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:08,009
you get yourself into trouble

861
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:10,269
think about that now before we jump in

862
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,829
no matter where you set up your drone

863
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,930
there are a few things to keep in mind

864
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:16,569
the thing I feel is most commonly

865
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:20,230
overlooked is the importance of air flow

866
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:22,750
and air exchange we need to exchange the

867
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,819
air in a grow room imagine if I stuck

868
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,950
you in a closet for 24 hours and I

869
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:29,500
didn't open the door for any fresh air

870
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,559
or to let out any of the gases they came

871
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,029
from you you'd be alive and you'd be a

872
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,009
little uncomfortable on the air in that

873
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:37,930
room would be so stale and funky that

874
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,509
you just couldn't wait to get out you'd

875
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:43,330
be ready for some fresh air the plants

876
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:46,119
feel the same way plants uptake co2 and

877
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:48,519
release oxygen so we have to think about

878
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,679
where we're getting fresh co2 from and

879
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,809
as the plants function they release

880
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,450
water vapor that increases the relative

881
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,059
humidity of our gross space so we have

882
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:01,630
to have a plan to get rid of that excess

883
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:03,460
humidity now as we remove the old air we

884
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,010
need to replace it with fresh air in

885
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,990
most small groves you'll be able to

886
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:09,519
replace the air probably with just the

887
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,380
airflow that flows from underneath the

888
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,329
door if you've got a closet grow or a

889
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,309
very small bedroom grow you'll get

890
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:17,259
enough air coming in through passive

891
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:19,659
vents like underneath the door most of

892
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:22,330
your grow tents will have passive vents

893
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,760
built into the bottom utilize those if

894
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:26,980
you're using a powerful enough blower

895
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,260
to extract the warm humid air from the

896
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,380
top of a grouse bass you may need to add

897
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,649
a passive intake to allow enough fresh

898
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:38,440
air to flow into your space so the major

899
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,710
consideration is airflow can you get air

900
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,289
in and out of your gross space don't

901
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,269
plan on leaving the door open as part of

902
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:48,309
your plan because what about the dark

903
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:50,679
cycle you can't leave the door open

904
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:52,570
during the dark cycle and also what

905
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,159
about those days whether you're not home

906
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,019
or what about that night when you get

907
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,599
too stoned and fall asleep and forget

908
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:01,929
don't rely on just leaving the door open

909
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:04,019
as part of your HVAC plan that is not

910
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:06,909
going to work that it's not sufficient

911
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:09,670
set yourself up for success give your

912
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:11,259
garden a chance and it will be so much

913
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,570
more enjoyable don't make it stressful

914
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,950
make it something you enjoy starting off

915
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,330
with a shitty plan like trying to

916
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:18,519
remember to close the door every night

917
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:19,319
at 9:30 that's gonna frustrate you in

918
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,429
two weeks

919
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,110
alright so I've stressed the importance

920
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:25,649
of airflow let's move forward and talk

921
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,840
about electricity and power consumption

922
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,210
can you safely provide electricity to

923
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,510
your grow area without causing a fire

924
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,429
hazard don't be that guy that burned

925
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,530
down your house with a poorly designed

926
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:40,419
to grow that makes the whole grove

927
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:43,720
movement look bad and sets us all back

928
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,720
five years so please be careful

929
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:49,269
can you power a grow light a fan an

930
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,589
exhaust fan maybe an air conditioner and

931
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:53,469
whatever else you need for the gross

932
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:55,930
space you choose don't pull too many

933
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:58,480
amps from one breaker for too long

934
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:02,589
because eventually something will melt

935
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,809
and you will have a fire if you flip a

936
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:07,600
breaker more than two times a day it is

937
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:10,900
time to reconsider your electrical plan

938
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,900
also be prepared to pay for your

939
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,269
electrical use you won't have a crop for

940
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,280
a few months but you're going to have

941
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:21,190
lights to pay for at the end of the

942
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,650
first month so be prepared for that bill

943
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,950
that's something a lot of young and new

944
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,960
growers forget to plan ahead for you

945
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:30,939
hang up your grow light you plug it in

946
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,250
you get [ __ ] run and you think yeah I'm

947
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,349
like 90 to 120 days I'm gonna harvest

948
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,139
and have a bunch of money and then in

949
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:40,538
about 35 days the bill comes and you

950
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:42,250
oh [ __ ] I gotta pay a hundred extra

951
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,079
dollars cuz I'm learning this bro light

952
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,838
and I didn't consider that plan ahead

953
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,089
there's a bill coming every month now

954
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,858
you've got a new bill to pay for that

955
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:53,380
bro keep that in mind

956
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:56,798
also if you are going to pull a lot of

957
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,869
extra electricity have a plan to tell

958
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:02,528
the electric company why you need an

959
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:05,588
excuse they may ask sometimes they call

960
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:07,630
sometimes they send a letter sometimes

961
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:11,139
they show up and walk around the house

962
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:14,380
to check for inefficiencies be very

963
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:17,159
careful also law enforcement can use

964
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,750
your electric bill as probable cause

965
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,058
with the new smart meters they can

966
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,548
probably tell exactly how many kilowatts

967
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,319
you're using and exactly which point of

968
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:29,230
the day so they can probably tell that

969
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:31,690
at 9 a.m. you start pulling 4000 watts

970
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,519
worth of extra power until 9 p.m. and

971
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,559
then it turns off they probably know

972
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:38,078
when you're in Flour they probably know

973
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,819
when you're in veg keep that sort of

974
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,068
stuff in mind when you're building and

975
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:43,750
designing your grow and also when you're

976
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:45,338
selecting your lights and equipment and

977
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,920
we'll talk about choosing lighting in a

978
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:50,409
future episode now the next thing we

979
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,838
should consider is water can you get

980
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:55,058
water to your grow area as your gross

981
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,578
space in the Attic how are you going to

982
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:59,500
get water to your attic are you gonna

983
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,390
fill up five gallon water bottles and

984
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,130
hook them up this that ladder or you're

985
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:05,108
gonna run a hose up there and hope you

986
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,528
don't have a catastrophe with that be

987
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:10,659
very careful either way please what if

988
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:12,730
your grows in the basement is there a

989
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:15,068
tap down there in the basement do you

990
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,420
have access to water think about where

991
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:18,818
your water is coming from

992
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,730
also think about runoff water you'll

993
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:23,558
need to dispose of water occasionally

994
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,889
especially if you're running a hydro

995
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:29,650
system does your basement have a floor

996
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:31,389
drain if it's got a floor drain give it

997
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,400
a test before you go pour in a whole

998
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:35,409
bunch of water down there pour a half a

999
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,548
gallon see what happens it doesn't clog

1000
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:41,139
up for a gallon pour to be patient

1001
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:43,239
because sometimes those floor drains

1002
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:44,379
they're backed up way down the line and

1003
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:46,479
you got to pour a bunch of water in

1004
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,680
there and then suddenly it overflows

1005
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,659
into your floor don't think you're gonna

1006
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,009
pour a big reservoir down there don't

1007
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,789
think you're gonna drain your hydro gear

1008
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,889
down there

1009
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:56,559
very careful test that floor drain

1010
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:58,629
before you rely on it too much you may

1011
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,269
also need to think about extra water

1012
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,250
consumption depends on how big your grow

1013
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:05,380
is it depends on how much they're paying

1014
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,150
attention it depends on if you pay the

1015
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,460
water bill or if the landlord pays the

1016
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,980
water bill this just may be something to

1017
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,500
consider since we're talking about water

1018
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,389
I'm gonna mention get a good shot back

1019
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,000
you're gonna have to get water to your

1020
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:22,420
grow on a daily basis I use about five

1021
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,219
gallons of water per light per day maybe

1022
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,710
every other day when the plants are

1023
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:28,239
smaller think about how much water

1024
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,909
you're going to need while you're

1025
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,159
planning your grow space do you really

1026
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:34,929
think you want to hook a five gallon

1027
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,629
container of water up that attic ladder

1028
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:40,149
for nine weeks if you're not a medical

1029
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,090
marijuana patient now you will be by the

1030
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,320
end of that grow cycle

1031
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,590
another thing we really need to think

1032
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,230
about when planning our grow space is

1033
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:53,170
darkness and light control can you make

1034
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,840
your space completely dark during your

1035
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,730
dark cycle I don't mean dark to where

1036
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,019
it's kind of dark I don't mean dark

1037
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,440
where there's a little bit of light I

1038
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:06,369
mean dark to where it is scary dark I

1039
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,800
mean zero light lay in your Dro space

1040
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:10,750
for five or ten minutes with your eyes

1041
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,970
open and let your eyes adjust to that

1042
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,949
total darkness then wave your hand in

1043
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:17,409
front of your face if you can see your

1044
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:19,839
hand at all it is too light in there we

1045
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:22,659
need absolute total darkness any light

1046
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,300
will potentially cause your plants to

1047
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:27,969
have issues if your plants have light

1048
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,740
during their supposed night cycle they

1049
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:31,389
might not even begin to flower you may

1050
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:33,339
think you're in flower and you're still

1051
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:34,989
vegging they may be getting just enough

1052
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,400
lights where they're kind of flowering

1053
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:37,599
but there's still kind of edging and

1054
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,280
they're looking really weird and they

1055
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,110
start taking on weird shapes and their

1056
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,540
leaves get strange you could have that

1057
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,670
or if you've got a very small light leak

1058
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:47,440
the area that is getting hit by that

1059
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,930
light will make hermaphrodite flowers

1060
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,639
and that will pollinate little sections

1061
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:55,119
of the room and you'll have little seeds

1062
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:58,509
in your buds so we need an area that we

1063
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,920
can keep absolutely dark during our dark

1064
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,930
cycles something that won't get

1065
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,519
interrupted by somebody needing to use

1066
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:05,719
the bathroom something that won't get

1067
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,130
interrupted by somebody needing to do

1068
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,689
three something that won't get

1069
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,210
interrupted by somebody going out to the

1070
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:13,490
garage to do something think ahead of

1071
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,130
all of the reasons somebody may need to

1072
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,649
go in your girl area that's why I like a

1073
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,630
little crow tent or isolated room or the

1074
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,720
back corner of the basement where nobody

1075
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:26,390
ever goes so those are the major things

1076
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:29,059
to think about when building your grow

1077
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:31,429
and selecting your grow space you want

1078
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:33,650
some more discreet and secure you need

1079
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:37,460
to be able to control temperature and

1080
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:40,730
humidity within a very tight range we

1081
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,119
want to get about 77 degrees with about

1082
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,460
40% humidity in our flower rooms you

1083
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,019
want to be able to dial that in you need

1084
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,929
some more with adequate power and

1085
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:54,800
available water you also may need an

1086
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:56,809
excuse for the extra consumption another

1087
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,000
very important factor we keep talked

1088
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:01,400
about is light control we can't have

1089
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,280
light interruptions in our grow we need

1090
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,380
to keep our light scheduled perfectly

1091
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,150
the dark cycle is super critical during

1092
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,039
flowering you guys it cannot be

1093
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,160
interrupted by the tiniest amount of

1094
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,750
light I can't stress that enough like I

1095
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,399
said earlier grow tents work great

1096
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,380
because somebody can't walk into the

1097
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,338
room and flip on the switch for the

1098
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,800
light that's in the room and

1099
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:23,960
accidentally get light in that grow tent

1100
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,210
if you've got it closed up properly

1101
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,650
don't leave it open for air flow like I

1102
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,659
talked about leaving the grow room door

1103
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,210
open earlier don't leave your grow tent

1104
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:34,579
open and get too stoned or get way too

1105
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,019
into a game of fork knife and totally

1106
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:37,880
forget that those lights went off at

1107
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:40,009
7:00 and you left that room open and now

1108
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,390
it's 8:30 and you're freaking out don't

1109
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,369
let that [ __ ] happen as long as you

1110
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:46,549
close the grow tent you should be safe

1111
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:49,220
from light interruptions I feel like I

1112
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,170
covered a lot of the basics of selecting

1113
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:53,239
your grow space think about your needs

1114
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,970
and your goals and try to find a space

1115
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,858
that works the best for you as long as

1116
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:00,829
you can provide the essentials you can

1117
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:02,630
make any space work I've grown in that

1118
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:05,150
little mini closet underneath the stairs

1119
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,269
in an apartment I've grown in a sketchy

1120
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:10,579
attic in a garage in Kansas I've grown

1121
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:12,349
in a spare bedroom in bessemer and I've

1122
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:14,480
busted out basements with somewhere

1123
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:17,240
between two and twelve lights depending

1124
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,590
on the basement I've also grown in giant

1125
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:19,869
where

1126
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:22,450
houses and I've done a lot of growing in

1127
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:24,219
growth hence the needs are the same in

1128
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:26,529
all of those spaces and a little

1129
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:28,619
planning and thought can make your tiny

1130
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:32,170
space produce the same quality as

1131
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:35,230
commercial grows if done wisely

1132
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:38,170
don't let anybody talk down to you for

1133
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,059
growing in a grow tent set your finished

1134
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,700
product next to their finished product

1135
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:45,159
and ask them if it was grown in a big

1136
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:46,839
room in a warehouse or in a tent it

1137
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,849
doesn't matter as long as you were

1138
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,910
producing a product that makes you happy

1139
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:53,529
and meets your demands that's the

1140
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:54,819
important part don't let anybody talk

1141
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,830
[ __ ] to you about the way you grow like

1142
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,680
we said last time you're only doing it

1143
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:01,599
wrong if the plants die now let's move

1144
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,000
forward a little bit something I want to

1145
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,639
mention is cleanliness if you set up in

1146
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,800
a basement or a spare room try to get

1147
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,190
anything not grow related out of that

1148
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,530
space I would recommend a solid cleaning

1149
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,840
of any space before setting up and if

1150
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,070
the space has a funky dingy smell like

1151
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,250
if you're in a basement it's got that

1152
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,170
basement smell try to find the cause of

1153
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,539
that what's down there making it funky

1154
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,400
can you get rid of it and then maybe get

1155
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:29,079
a bunch of fresh air through that space

1156
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,059
for a little while before you set up

1157
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:31,569
maybe open some windows get some fans

1158
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,909
going

1159
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:37,300
spray some ozium in there just try to

1160
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:39,369
get rid of that funky smell because that

1161
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,410
smell could stick to your buds you don't

1162
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:43,210
want to grow in a funky space and then

1163
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:45,250
you don't want your product to end up

1164
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,800
smelling like funky basement and it will

1165
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:50,139
if your space has that funk especially

1166
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,420
if you're going to dry and cure in a

1167
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:53,920
funky basement so try to get rid of that

1168
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,470
funky basement smell you can do that

1169
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,539
just by getting air into the room get a

1170
00:44:56,469 --> 00:45:00,429
little airflow going get that old funky

1171
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,710
air out of there that'll really help you

1172
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:05,589
out earlier I said to clean the room

1173
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:08,079
everything in a room is a spot for a

1174
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:10,420
spider mite or a pest to hang out and

1175
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,949
hide every little spot if you got some

1176
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,450
clothes in there that's a beautiful spot

1177
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:15,519
for a bunch of bugs just to hang out

1178
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:17,649
just try to clean up the space and have

1179
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,420
a nice tidy gross space it'll help you

1180
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,910
keep everything organized and it will

1181
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,639
help you keep bugs away to find a good

1182
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:27,250
space make sure it's safe make sure you

1183
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,349
can get a lot of airflow to the area

1184
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,480
make sure you can get water to the area

1185
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:34,449
if you're going to provide supple

1186
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,519
little co2 to your grow space make sure

1187
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:40,089
you can carry co2 tanks to the area

1188
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,889
those tanks are heavy make sure that you

1189
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:44,320
can control the lights in your grow

1190
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:46,750
space and also the darkness in your grow

1191
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,750
space and be sure that you can control

1192
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,699
the flow of human traffic in your girl

1193
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,530
area also you don't want your pets down

1194
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:55,059
there I do not encourage people taking

1195
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,530
their animals to the girl I see it a lot

1196
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,869
if you want your pet in the girl that's

1197
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,490
on you I do not encourage it they go

1198
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,260
play in the yard they're picking up

1199
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:04,029
pests probably from every plant in the

1200
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,400
yard or bringing it right into your girl

1201
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,320
I don't encourage that but you do what

1202
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,500
makes you happy like I said you're only

1203
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,000
doing it wrong when the plants die so

1204
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,460
the next step is to make sure this is

1205
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,108
something you want to do and then we

1206
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,530
will talk about selecting specific

1207
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:23,500

1208

00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:41,570
off by letting you know what I'm smoking

1270

citron fam Broza

1272
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,450
from our friends at apothecary farms on

1273
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:50,269
the last episode I described the flavour

1274
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:52,849
as oranges rolled in sugar with a hint

1275
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:55,190
of purple Laffy Taffy's I really enjoy

1276
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:56,839
this concentrate I've got a lot of it so

1277
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,269
we'll be smoking this for a couple of

1278
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,940
episodes this is going to be the third

1279
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:04,550
episode in my long series of grow

1280
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,869
lessons in the past two episodes we

1281
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,510
talked a little bit about setting goals

1282
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:10,730
and planning your grow then we talked

1283
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,070
more specifically about selecting and

1284
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,380
planning your space now in this episode

1285
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,700
we're going to focus more in on the

1286
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,460
equipment and choosing the appropriate

1287
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:21,169
equipment for your grow we need the

1288
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,970
right equipment for the size of your

1289
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,740
grow we need the right equipment to meet

1290
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:27,109
your goals and we need the right

1291
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,929
equipment to meet our power consumption

1292
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:32,150
limits so let's get into a podcast all

1293
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:35,089
about selecting equipment for your new

1294
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:37,190
grow now in a previous episode we talked

1295
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,500
about selecting your space and thinking

1296
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,840
about your goals now your space is

1297
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,059
really going to dictate how much light

1298
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,100
you can put in there your amount of

1299
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:48,860
electricity available is really going to

1300
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:50,960
dictate how much gear we put in there

1301
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,910
try to keep these things in mind and

1302
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,500
have realistic expectations of your

1303
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:57,019
garden while we're designing and

1304
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:59,219
building your new grow now let's talk

1305
00:49:57,019 --> 00:50:01,320
about selecting lighting light

1306
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:03,989
is probably the number one decision to

1307
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,180
make when designing a new grow if you've

1308
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:09,299
got a small closet or a very small

1309
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:11,399
cupboard area your lighting options are

1310
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,320
going to be limited to smaller lower

1311
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,108
powered lights that don't put off a lot

1312
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,450
of heat but that's okay as long as they

1313
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:20,969
like your small space appropriately

1314
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:23,789
you don't need a gigantic light in there

1315
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:25,469
for a small closet or a cupboard or

1316
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:27,480
something that's been converted into a

1317
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:29,969
grow space like a dresser or an armoire

1318
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,159
or a storage cabinet or something that's

1319
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:33,299
kind of incognito something like our

1320
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,339
friends that love for the plant would

1321
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,250
create if you're running a small space

1322
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,590
maybe a t5 light would work in there if

1323
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:44,369
you want to upgrade from a t5 your next

1324
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:46,980
best option is an LED LEDs are great for

1325
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:50,010
small spaces LED technology has come a

1326
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,710
long way I do not have a lot of personal

1327
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:55,410
experience with LEDs I also don't have a

1328
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:58,530
lot of experience in small spaces I have

1329
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:00,989
seen LEDs kill it in little spaces they

1330
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:02,580
do very well for a small home grows if

1331
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:03,868
you've done an apartment or somewhere

1332
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:06,569
where you can't take up a lot of power

1333
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:09,300
an LED is a great option and it works

1334
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:11,220
great in a closet in a cupboard or in a

1335
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,859
small piece of furniture that has been

1336
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:15,838
converted into your little secret home

1337
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:18,750
grow space that's hidden right there in

1338
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,699
plain sight so a t5 light is probably

1339
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,838
like your beginner light your lowest

1340
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:23,879
power light that I would recommend

1341
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,829
growing cannabis with then you've got

1342
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,559
your LED lights so if you've got a small

1343
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:31,049
space a t5 or an LED may work for you

1344
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,480
then we work our way into something like

1345
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,640
a tent or a small enclosure that we have

1346
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,559
built or maybe a mini room that we have

1347
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:40,348
sectioned off that's when you can work

1348
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:43,500
your way into either more or larger t

1349
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:44,880
fives more or larger LEDs you can buy

1350
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,420
more of them or you can get higher

1351
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,849
powered LEDs or there are also ceramic

1352
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,769
metal halide lights ceramic metal

1353
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:54,809
halides are great in the same way that

1354
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:57,389
LEDs are because they don't put off a

1355
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:59,699
lot of heat the t5 LEDs in the ceramic

1356
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:01,920
metal halides are going to be fairly low

1357
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:03,539
heat there is heat but not as much as

1358
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,579
you're gonna get from the high-intensity

1359
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:07,739
discharge lighting that we're gonna talk

1360
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,569
about here in just a minute so the t5

1361
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,098
LED in the ceramic metal halide are

1362
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,600
great for a tent they don't put off a

1363
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,250
lot of heat

1364
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,619
also do not consume a lot of electricity

1365
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,150
so if you are limited on electrical

1366
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:21,869
consumption those are great options

1367
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:23,970
another advantage of the t5 the LEDs and

1368
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,619
the ceramic metal halide is since they

1369
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:27,809
don't put off so much heat on their own

1370
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,909
you don't have to buy more cooling

1371
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:32,009
equipment to plug in and use even more

1372
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:34,230
electricity so it's kind of a win-win

1373
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:36,570
with those however I don't feel like

1374
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:38,550
they put out the same harvest weight

1375
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,160
that a high-intensity discharge light

1376
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:43,590
will put out but if you're limited on

1377
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,299
space and limited on electrical

1378
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,850
consumption and you're not able to cool

1379
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,400
it those smaller lights are absolutely

1380
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:52,650
the way to go so now let's talk a little

1381
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,510
bit about high intensity discharge

1382
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,670
lighting and I'm not gonna focus too

1383
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:58,800
much on any specific kind of lighting or

1384
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:01,320
brand because I'm not here to really

1385
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,630
sell you any type of product I want to

1386
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,400
give you guidance on the things that you

1387
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,260
may want to pay attention to while

1388
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,809
you're thinking about building your grow

1389
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,490
I'm not gonna pitch you specific stuff

1390
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:13,380
because that's up to you to decide I

1391
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,119
want you to customize your grow but I'm

1392
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,760
gonna give you a really good blueprint

1393
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,099
and a really good idea of how to get to

1394
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,690
your goal so let's talk more about

1395
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,639
high-intensity discharge lighting

1396
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,070
high-intensity discharge lighting is

1397
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,900
like a high pressure sodium or a metal

1398
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,090
halide bulb they are powered by a

1399
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,309
ballast that you plug into the wall that

1400
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,769
ballast generates more power to power

1401
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:38,190
that large high intensity discharge bulb

1402
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:42,059
they put off a lot of light and a lot of

1403
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:43,679
heat as well I've seen 250 watt high

1404
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:45,779
pressure sodium bulbs I'm sure they make

1405
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,669
smaller but I've never seen it offered

1406
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:50,850
in a gross store or anything I've never

1407
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:53,280
looked for it I have used and seen a 250

1408
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:55,829
400 watt high-pressure sodium and metal

1409
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,170
halides are very common six hundreds are

1410
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:59,639
fairly common and thousands are the

1411
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,950
industry standard if you're using

1412
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,719
high-intensity discharge lighting in a

1413
00:54:01,949 --> 00:54:05,899
commercial facility there are probably

1414
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,309
thousand watt lights they're probably

1415
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,559
double-ended Kavita's which is a whole

1416
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:12,360
step up we'll talk about that a little

1417
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,539
bit later when we get into the warehouse

1418
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,559
environment but if you've been you can

1419
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,570
use the t5

1420
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,610
you can use LEDs you can use ceramic

1421
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:23,309
metal halides or you can work your way

1422
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,849
into a small play intensity discharge

1423
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:28,340
light you can use the 250 in a small

1424
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:31,099
ten maybe a 3x3 I wouldn't go any larger

1425
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:33,260
you can use anything from a four hundred

1426
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:35,900
to a thousand watt high intensity

1427
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,090
discharge light any 5x5 ten and you

1428
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,860
should be okay if you learn how to

1429
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,420
control the temperature properly you're

1430
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,340
going to need to duck to the light and

1431
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,110
in a moment we will talk about ducted

1432
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:48,140
lighting so if you're going with the

1433
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:50,000
tent you can use t5 lights t5 you gotta

1434
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:51,980
get them real close to the plant to get

1435
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,289
a lot of real productive growth and it

1436
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,300
takes a lot of them t5 I wouldn't

1437
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:58,279
recommend it unless you absolutely are

1438
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:02,990
on a low budget for lights and power

1439
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:05,300
consumption LEDs are very brand and

1440
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:07,039
style specific you have to learn the

1441
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,450
light you've got and the plants you've

1442
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,429
got together I don't have enough

1443
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:12,769
experience with the LEDs but I've seen

1444
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:14,659
some kickass product come from LED

1445
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:16,219
lighting they also don't put out a lot

1446
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:18,289
of heat and they don't use up a lot of

1447
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:20,209
electricity so that's great in a tent or

1448
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:22,699
a small room environment the ceramic

1449
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,740
metal halides are very similar to the

1450
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:26,329
LEDs they don't use a lot of power they

1451
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,789
don't put off a lot of heat and you get

1452
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:31,219
a quality product that should make you

1453
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:33,980
happy those are gonna be fairly easy to

1454
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:36,199
cool in a small space in a small tent

1455
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,780
then if we work our way into the small

1456
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,149
high-intensity discharge lighting that's

1457
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,070
when you have to start thinking about

1458
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,240
cooling the room much more efficiently

1459
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,160
you have to think about getting that

1460
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,750
heat out and getting fresh air into the

1461
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,029
room that's when you start thinking

1462
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,199
about ducted lights or open lights and

1463
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,660
we're gonna talk about that more in a

1464
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,879
second but just keep in mind for now

1465
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:57,440
that the bigger light we use the more

1466
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,300
cooling we're gonna have to focus on

1467
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,889
which will be more electricity so you're

1468
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,900
pulling a bigger light and now you're

1469
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:04,879
adding more cooling so you're doubling

1470
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,639
up your electrical load keep that in

1471
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,099
mind now let's move from a larger space

1472
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:12,379
from a one light situation to maybe a

1473
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:14,329
two or four light situation where we've

1474
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,280
got a larger tent or maybe a dedicated

1475
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,349
room let's talk about our lighting

1476
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,420
options there this is where I would move

1477
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:22,759
away from the t5 I wouldn't consider a

1478
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,930
t5 if you're doing this much you're just

1479
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,060
wasting light you're wasting electricity

1480
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:27,289
you're not gonna see production if

1481
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:29,000
you've got four lights you need

1482
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:30,529
production let's hang up some real

1483
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,019
lights you can go with LEDs get a

1484
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:34,850
quality LED something with high output

1485
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:36,519
not a little starter LED you need a good

1486
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,230
one if you're going this route or

1487
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,679
multiple ceramic metal halide lights you

1488
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,088
can place

1489
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,338
them closer together because they don't

1490
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:45,078
take as much electricity you can have

1491
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:47,630
more of them you can cover more of a

1492
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:51,559
footprint I think they cover about a 3x3

1493
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:53,930
maybe a 4x4 area for the 315 ceramic

1494
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,420
metal halide your LED light is going to

1495
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:57,739
be very light and brand specific it

1496
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,260
should tell you what the footprint

1497
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:03,019
covers on there go a little smaller than

1498
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,540
that and I think you'll be happy so for

1499
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:07,759
a room step away from the t5 s maybe get

1500
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:10,670
a high powered LED may be multiple

1501
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,579
ceramic metal halides or in a room this

1502
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:15,470
is where we can start using multiple 600

1503
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:18,440
and or multiple thousand watt

1504
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:19,879
high-intensity discharge lights I think

1505
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,920
I've kind of covered the pros and cons

1506
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,300
of the LEDs and the ceramic metal

1507
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,619
halides they don't use a lot of

1508
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,420
electricity they don't make a lot of

1509
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:28,608
heat but they also don't put out like a

1510
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,380
high-intensity discharge light so now

1511
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:32,808
let's talk about the differences between

1512
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,059
eight six hundred and a thousand watt

1513
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:37,910
high pressure sodium bulb for flowering

1514
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:40,579
with two six hundreds you can cover a

1515
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:43,759
little more space with less shadow with

1516
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:46,490
1000 watt you can cover a really nice

1517
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,900
space with a whole lot of light so it's

1518
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:50,689
kind of up to you do you want to run two

1519
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:53,180
sixes or do you want to run one thousand

1520
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,950
keep in mind the height how much height

1521
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:56,598
you've got if your ceiling is low go

1522
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:58,578
with the six hundreds if you're not able

1523
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,740
to do a lot of cooling go with the six

1524
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:02,240
hundreds think about six hundred watt

1525
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:04,399
lights or a thousand watt lights when

1526
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,048
you're planning your grow the six

1527
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,180
hundred watt high pressure sodium light

1528
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:10,009
will be more efficient if you're trying

1529
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:12,649
to decide between a six hundred and a

1530
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:14,740
thousand but the thousand is going to

1531
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:17,180
push your plants just a little bit more

1532
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:19,548
earlier what I said about shadows what I

1533
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:21,230
mean is if you've got 1,000 watt bulb

1534
00:58:19,548 --> 00:58:23,239
coming from right above all of your

1535
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,829
plants you've got one source of light

1536
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:26,389
you're going to create shadows because

1537
00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:28,970
you only have light coming from one

1538
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:30,529
direction if you have two sixes that are

1539
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:32,750
just a little bit apart you've got light

1540
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,970
coming from two directions so that will

1541
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,679
give you less shadows more of your buds

1542
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:38,929
will get light and that is actually a

1543
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,009
little more efficient than one bulb and

1544
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:42,469
a bunch of shadows

1545
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:45,410
now is probably a good time to start

1546
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:48,048
thinking about open or ducted light

1547
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:49,759
reflectors just to be clear about what

1548
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:51,829
I'm talking about when we hang up our

1549
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,450
grow lights that enclosure is known as

1550
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:56,060
the reflector then we

1551
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:58,460
screw the bulb into the socket or and

1552
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:00,980
cord set that runs to the ballast the

1553
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:03,019
ballast plugs into I've got another cord

1554
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:06,679
that plugs into the wall so that

1555
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:08,960
reflector they are available in tons of

1556
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:12,049
different styles at this point right now

1557
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,088
let's think about vented or open do you

1558
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,310
want a light that's got glass between

1559
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:17,750
your grow and the bulb so that it keeps

1560
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:19,400
that heat in there and we can set up

1561
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,070
ducting to move that heat out of the

1562
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,320
room or do you want to allow that heat

1563
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:27,170
from the bulb to enter the grow room and

1564
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,900
combat that with air conditioning both

1565
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,930
are reasonable options both have their

1566
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:35,329
pros and cons not ducting your lights

1567
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:37,578
means that you've got to cool that room

1568
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:39,710
that means you've got to add air

1569
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:41,300
conditioning we'll talk about air

1570
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:44,240
conditioning options in just a minute

1571
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,579
now if you do choose to vent your lights

1572
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:49,039
make sure you run the ducting to where

1573
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:51,710
none of the odor from your grow is going

1574
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,199
to make it out of wherever that air is

1575
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:56,210
being expelled from your area we don't

1576
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,309
need to blow that hot cannabis aroma

1577
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,019
right into the neighbor's bedroom window

1578
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:01,849
so think about that when you're setting

1579
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:03,800
up your grow we'll talk about carbon

1580
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:05,960
filters and odor control here in just a

1581
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,880
minute so think about if you want a duct

1582
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,679
and have cooled lights or if you want to

1583
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,358
have open lights if you've got duct

1584
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,190
Advantage lights there will be a piece

1585
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,159
of glass between the bulb and your

1586
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,750
plants that needs to stay clean also

1587
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,429
that means more equipment that means we

1588
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,050
need a powerful blower we need some

1589
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:23,480
ducting and we need something running

1590
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,220
out of the grow space possibly out of

1591
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,318
the house which is going to need to be

1592
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:29,868
camouflaged and taken care of discreetly

1593
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:31,940
the advantage deducting your lights is

1594
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:33,588
less cooling you're not going to need as

1595
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,599
much air conditioning you're going to

1596
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:37,789
need one blower to blow over the lights

1597
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,280
to get that hot air out of there if that

1598
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:42,019
hot air is going out of the house or out

1599
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,550
of your building you need carbon

1600
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:46,429
filtration which we're gonna talk about

1601
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:48,800
in just a minute so back in the day most

1602
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:51,440
home growers were designed with ducted

1603
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:54,079
lights most commercial grows however do

1604
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,510
not use vented or ducted lights we use

1605
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,339
go Vitas which are hung really high

1606
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:00,410
because we need them about three feet

1607
01:00:58,338 --> 01:01:02,449
maybe more from the canopy because they

1608
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:04,309
do get really hot they are so intense

1609
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:06,259
not just from heat but so intense from

1610
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:07,349
light that they can cause burn and

1611
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,120
wrinkle and bleed

1612
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:12,000
on the tips of the plants so in a

1613
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,159
commercial environment we use non-ducted

1614
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,579
lighting in a home grow it is very

1615
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,960
common to see the ducted lighting a lot

1616
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,369
of home grows now a lot of guys are

1617
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,349
going hard and they're actually hanging

1618
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:24,449
up the lower wattage kavita's they're

1619
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:26,849
hanging up the Gavita 750s and i'm

1620
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:28,649
seeing great success with that you will

1621
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,509
need to know how to trellis and control

1622
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,789
the height of your canopy if you plan on

1623
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:35,130
using DeVita's in a basement or in a

1624
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:37,559
bedroom unless you've got extremely high

1625
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:39,090
ceilings so for a homegirl here's a

1626
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:41,309
quick just a quick breakdown of how I

1627
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:42,780
would do it it would go carbon filter

1628
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:45,000
and I would have the appropriate carbon

1629
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,190
filter for the size of my room then I

1630
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,110
would have a blower and I would have an

1631
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:51,659
appropriate blower to go with that

1632
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:53,579
carbon filter either a six inch or 8

1633
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:55,079
inch maybe a 10 maybe a 12 depending on

1634
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:58,529
the size of the girl and how many lights

1635
01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:00,360
then possibly a why I'd have a piece of

1636
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:04,560
ducting that sits on my blower that

1637
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:06,800
maybe goes to a Y if I'm running 4 or 6

1638
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,179
lights I will do the Y and I will run

1639
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,470
three lights parallel or two lights

1640
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:13,739
parallel to where it goes

1641
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:15,239
carbon filter blower Y duct then coming

1642
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:17,069
off of each side of the Y we've got a

1643
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:19,139
little ducting then we've got a vented

1644
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:21,480
light a little more ducting a vented

1645
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:23,159
light then those two ducts sometimes

1646
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,659
they come together sometimes I don't put

1647
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,269
them back together depending on where

1648
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:30,059
I'm exiting with that ducting then they

1649
01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:31,530
go out of the grow area whether out of

1650
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:33,299
the house whether out of the building

1651
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,220
just depends on where I am a because out

1652
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,440
of the room into another room or it's

1653
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:41,250
taken care of there but it goes carbon

1654
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,380
filter blower maybe a Y maybe not and

1655
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:45,389
then lights and then maybe back together

1656
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,250
maybe not and then out and then at the

1657
01:02:45,389 --> 01:02:49,409
end there it's always a good idea to

1658
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,179
have something to prevent other things

1659
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:52,799
from climbing into the grow you don't

1660
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:54,059
want to get a mouse that feels a bunch

1661
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,200
of warm air coming out of there in the

1662
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,909
middle of the night he's like oh look a

1663
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,949
little warm duct and a mouse or a lizard

1664
01:02:56,909 --> 01:03:00,359
or somebody possibly a snake climbs

1665
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:02,549
right into your ducting ends up in your

1666
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,260
grow light cooks itself maybe makes it

1667
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,000
all the way to the blower shreds itself

1668
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,770
I don't know what can happen put

1669
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,570
something on the end there it may sound

1670
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:12,090
crazy a pair of pantyhose works

1671
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:13,710
beautifully goes the local Walgreens or

1672
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,329
whatever you may look like a weirdo if

1673
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,159
you're a big dude but buy a couple of

1674
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:18,809
pair of black panties OHS and then just

1675
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:20,679
like a condom stretch them over the end

1676
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:22,480
of your ducting secure it with some duct

1677
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,608
and that way nothing can climb up in the

1678
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,809
end there they do sell more expensive

1679
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:27,909
options to put at the end of your

1680
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:30,548
ducting but pantyhose will work just

1681
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:32,858
fine if you use a couple of layers and

1682
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:34,028
here's a really random piece of advice

1683
01:03:32,858 --> 01:03:37,739
while I'm thinking about it

1684
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:40,269
if you have got that end going outside

1685
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:41,949
you're going to have to put some bends

1686
01:03:40,269 --> 01:03:45,219
in your ducting to prevent light from

1687
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:47,889
coming down that ducting during your

1688
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:49,959
dark cycle if there is light outside so

1689
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:52,210
you've got that ducting that goes it's a

1690
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,088
carbon filter blower ducting light

1691
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:57,400
ducting maybe another light maybe more

1692
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:59,440
ducting then out of the house right now

1693
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,480
imagine the Sun comes up and your lights

1694
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,220
aren't on yet if that sun is shining

1695
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,139
toward the direction of that duct it'll

1696
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:06,578
shine light right down that ducting and

1697
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:07,719
it's reflective on the inside so it's

1698
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:09,490
gonna bounce through there and end up

1699
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,139
into your grow room and it will come out

1700
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:12,578
of the lights looking just like a grow

1701
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:14,259
light it'll be a low-power girl light

1702
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:16,298
but will be coming out and the plants

1703
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,760
will think it's daytime because that Sun

1704
01:04:16,298 --> 01:04:20,889
is awesome that subtle tongue wake up

1705
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,690
little ladies and they will so you've

1706
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:25,629
got to prevent that put some sort of a

1707
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:28,088
light baffle outside and also bend the

1708
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:29,829
ducting on the inside to prevent that go

1709
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:32,440
in there and turn off the lights in your

1710
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:33,880
grow and just hang out and see if it is

1711
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,500
totally dark in there we talked about

1712
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,088
this in another episode if you can see

1713
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:39,639
your hand in front of your face at all

1714
01:04:37,088 --> 01:04:42,909
it is too dark we need absolute darkness

1715
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:46,179
in the grow so that's a lot of talk

1716
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:48,670
about ducted or vented lights and non

1717
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:50,409
vented or open lights they've both got

1718
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:53,619
their pros and cons but the lighting you

1719
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:55,118
decide may dictate a lot of the rest of

1720
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:57,430
your setup so be careful when you choose

1721
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:00,190
your lighting now let's talk about

1722
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:02,558
moving into larger spaces if you've got

1723
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:04,480
a barn or an outbuilding with high

1724
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,490
ceilings and a lot of electrical

1725
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,778
availability then I would recommend

1726
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:12,729
moving into double-ended bulb technology

1727
01:05:09,778 --> 01:05:15,039
there are much more high output they do

1728
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:16,929
put off a lot more heat but the plants

1729
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,569
will definitely show you the difference

1730
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:21,788
I can pull about 3 pounds per light

1731
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:23,949
consistently from a double-ended bulb

1732
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:25,390
now I know earlier I said I would try

1733
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:27,608
not to talk about brands and pitch

1734
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,808
brands to you but the industry standard

1735
01:05:27,608 --> 01:05:30,969
the double-ended

1736
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:33,369
horticultural bulb in a colorado

1737
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,539
commercial grow facility is of course

1738
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:36,340
the Gavita so

1739
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:37,509
I try not to recommend too many brands

1740
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,940
to you but I'll tell you straight up I

1741
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:42,340
would use the kavita's if I were going

1742
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,590
to build a large bro right now as many

1743
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:47,470
of them as I can fit I want about one

1744
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,930
Gavita per four by four or five by five

1745
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:51,759
foot space so for a warehouse or a

1746
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:53,469
commercial environment or maybe a large

1747
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,140
barn with high ceilings I would always

1748
01:05:53,469 --> 01:05:57,459
recommend the double-ended technology of

1749
01:05:56,139 --> 01:06:00,369
course I would recommend a Gavita

1750
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,800
however they do produce a lot of heat

1751
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:05,049
you're going to need more cooling if

1752
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,600
you're using kavita's also you need

1753
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:10,810
those high ceilings I recommend you keep

1754
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,029
your Gavita lights about three feet

1755
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:14,949
maybe more from the top of your plants

1756
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:17,260
unless you've got some serious cooling

1757
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:19,329
you want those lights about three feet

1758
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,010
away from the top of your canopy so

1759
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:22,210
think about that by the end of flower if

1760
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,160
you've got big giant buds

1761
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:26,199
you still need three foot of space or

1762
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:29,319
you're gonna start burning and bleaching

1763
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:31,000
the tips of your plants now for veg you

1764
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,430
can use whatever kind of light you're

1765
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,800
comfortable with vegging c-5s work for

1766
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:38,049
small plants LEDs and ceramic metal

1767
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,820
halides will definitely work for veg for

1768
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,860
smaller plants if you're gonna get into

1769
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:43,960
a commercial grow I would recommend for

1770
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:46,720
hundreds six hundreds if you can or even

1771
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,849
just veg under your thousands or in a

1772
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,649
commercial environment try to veg under

1773
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:52,690
Gavita as they make metal halide and

1774
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:55,000
high pressure sodium bulbs for your

1775
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,880
DeVita's and just cuz they know somebody

1776
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,619
is gonna ask for vegging we prefer metal

1777
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,690
halide bulbs you want more of the blue

1778
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:03,519
spectrum for veg that keeps your plants

1779
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:05,829
shorter and helps them root for

1780
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,469
flowering we want high pressure sodium

1781
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:10,360
that's more of a orange and red spectrum

1782
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:13,569
that's going to give you bigger fruits

1783
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:16,510
and more growth so metal halide for veg

1784
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:17,650
high pressure sodium for flower way

1785
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:19,690
different spectrums are going to be

1786
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:21,940
available for your LED lighting check

1787
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:24,039
out your specific light manufacturers

1788
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:26,470
options there are so many options for

1789
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:30,309
LEDs that I cannot even get specific you

1790
01:07:26,469 --> 01:07:31,959
guys so let's quickly recap lighting if

1791
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:34,960
you're in a tent or a small space

1792
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,670
two-fives are a good option LEDs will

1793
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,750
work for you you could work with a small

1794
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:42,309
ceramic halide or maybe a very small 250

1795
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:44,139
watt high pressure sodium but I wouldn't

1796
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:45,769
go much more than that when you start

1797
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:47,569
working into the smaller tents

1798
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:49,369
or a small broom that's when you can

1799
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:52,369
start introducing the bigger lights the

1800
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:54,410
small HIDs the 250 or a 400 if you get

1801
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:56,210
yourself a 5 by 5 10 that's when you can

1802
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:57,980
step up to a six hundred or a thousand

1803
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:59,599
watt light when you start working on a

1804
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:02,179
production grow you're busting out a

1805
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,769
whole room a dedicated space or maybe a

1806
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:06,169
larger tent that's when you can work

1807
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:08,000
your way into multiple six hundreds or

1808
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,470
multiple thousand watt lights and of

1809
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,659
course if you're gonna run a warehouse I

1810
01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:13,759
highly recommend double-ended bulb

1811
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:16,039
technology again I recommend the

1812
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,720
kavita's and they do not pay me now keep

1813
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:18,680
in mind that your lights are going to

1814
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,390
heat the room

1815
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,460
very quickly you're going to need

1816
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:25,520
appropriate air-conditioning and you're

1817
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,079
going to need appropriate air flow so

1818
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,540
let's talk about air conditioning and

1819
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:32,109
then we will work our way into air flow

1820
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:35,778
and odor control air conditioning

1821
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:37,430
cooling in a small grill environment you

1822
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:40,250
can probably get away with a small

1823
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:41,990
window air conditioner now maybe you

1824
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:44,479
don't have the option of installing a

1825
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:46,670
small window air conditioner you can

1826
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,709
also use those portable air conditioners

1827
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:50,329
they're on wheels and they have ducting

1828
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,220
they have a duct that brings the air in

1829
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:55,250
and a duct that shoots the old hot air

1830
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:57,650
out I like to use those but I do not use

1831
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,750
the in duct I only use the duct that

1832
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:01,639
shoots the heat out I keep the air from

1833
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,319
my grow room being recycled in the grow

1834
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,838
so I'm not bringing out that air from

1835
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:06,289
outside and introducing it into the grow

1836
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:08,449
room

1837
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:10,880
there's no filtration in that air

1838
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:12,528
conditioner before that air gets into my

1839
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,539
growth so I don't want to suck in some

1840
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:16,910
weird stuff and bring it into the gross

1841
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:18,798
light don't use that duct I only use the

1842
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:20,809
out duct on a portable air conditioner

1843
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,640
now those portable air conditioners are

1844
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:24,380
very inefficient they cost a lot of

1845
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,630
money to buy and they cost a lot of

1846
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:29,270
money to run but they are very discreet

1847
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,920
they are very portable and they work

1848
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,810
very well they'll cool the room down

1849
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,980
very quickly you can kind of roll it

1850
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:36,410
right to where you need it

1851
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:37,818
those are always an option something to

1852
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:39,798
think about with air conditioning is

1853
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:43,190
you've got air going out of your grow

1854
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:45,769
room now it is not filtered if your room

1855
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:48,199
with your grow is right up against your

1856
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,000
neighbors house also putting that air

1857
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:51,769
conditioner in that window may not be an

1858
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,779
option because you might start blasting

1859
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,980
that sweet ganja smell right into your

1860
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:56,090
neighbors bedroom and they're gonna be

1861
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:57,429
trying to sleep and they're just going

1862
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,920
to be dreamed about smoking

1863
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:02,920
and a fishpond sir so be careful where

1864
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,390
you duck your air conditioning air now

1865
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:08,140
another really important thing to think

1866
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:10,930
about is how much air conditioning do we

1867
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,420
need and a small grow and a residential

1868
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:15,430
grow not a warehouse type of environment

1869
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,149
if you're using thousand watt high

1870
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:21,340
pressure sodium lights I recommend about

1871
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:24,369
three thousand BTUs of cooling per

1872
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:28,449
thousand walk light I'll say that again

1873
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:31,329
for you I recommend three thousand BTUs

1874
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:33,729
of cooling for every thousand watt light

1875
01:10:31,329 --> 01:10:35,350
so if you've got two lights you want six

1876
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,059
thousand watts of air-conditioning if

1877
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:38,800
you've got four lights you want twelve

1878
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,680
thousand watts of air-conditioning I

1879
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,750
also recommend go a little extra because

1880
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,060
it's been hot lately every summer it

1881
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:48,100
gets hotter and hotter and I don't want

1882
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,810
you to struggle in your grow with heat a

1883
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,570
lot of the companies that make the

1884
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:55,570
portable air conditioners make a 14,000

1885
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:58,000
BTU unit that is just about perfect for

1886
01:10:55,569 --> 01:11:00,340
a 4000 watt light setup which is

1887
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,470
beautiful for a spare bedroom so that's

1888
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,420
something to think about now if you're

1889
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:06,250
in a tiny grow like a closet or maybe a

1890
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,750
space that you've built I understand

1891
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,130
that you can't install an air

1892
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,050
conditioner the way you're gonna have to

1893
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:13,600
cool that is by putting a blower

1894
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:16,390
somewhere in there and exhausting the

1895
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,579
heat out of that enclosure into the main

1896
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:20,950
room and then pulling air in through

1897
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:22,390
maybe a passive duct from the room

1898
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:23,500
that's already got nice fresh air if

1899
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,090
you're in the room it's probably

1900
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,529
comfortable for the plants so if your

1901
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,970
ducting out that hot air and just

1902
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:30,009
pulling in fresh air through a past

1903
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:32,020
event and like a small enclosure that

1904
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:34,180
will work perfectly just make sure

1905
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:36,460
you've got enough power to suck the air

1906
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:38,409
out of that enclosure often enough and

1907
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,510
also make sure you put a carbon filter

1908
01:11:38,409 --> 01:11:42,699
on there so that you don't snitch on

1909
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:44,350
yourself and blow that fresh ganja

1910
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,939
scented air right into the living room

1911
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:47,260
where everybody's hanging out you think

1912
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:49,210
you've got this little enclosure it's

1913
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,590
all smooth you've got a fish tank set up

1914
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:52,149
next to it so that all that noise is

1915
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:54,340
covered and all the plugins are covered

1916
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:55,689
you've got an excuse for everything but

1917
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,819
every time they walk past it they just

1918
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:59,679
get blown with wind that smells like

1919
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:01,389
ganja pay attention to that sort of

1920
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,890
stuff you guys so in a small enclosure

1921
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:04,570
you're gonna have to use a blower to

1922
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:07,240
close it or to cool it and you're gonna

1923
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:08,949
have to use passive air from the room to

1924
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:10,449
cool that and like I said if you're in

1925
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:10,840
the room that's where you live if that's

1926
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:12,789
for your

1927
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,739
it's probably comfortable for the plants

1928
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:16,510
it's not gonna be perfect but in a small

1929
01:12:14,738 --> 01:12:19,629
enclosure that may be the best you can

1930
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:22,480
do now let's talk about cooling a giant

1931
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:25,090
facility a warehouse or maybe a small

1932
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:26,979
barn when it comes to cooling

1933
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,719
Gavita lighting it is a totally

1934
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:31,089
different ballgame this is when we move

1935
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,730
into industrial cooling this is when we

1936
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:35,800
move into rooftop units we can't use

1937
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,368
little wall units and portable units

1938
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,010
anymore

1939
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:42,039
we have to get big boy air conditioning

1940
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:43,960
and HVAC setups so if you're setting up

1941
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:47,349
an industrial grow and you're gonna hang

1942
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:52,689
a vides I will recommend between four

1943
01:12:47,349 --> 01:12:55,239
and six thousand BTU per Gavita or one

1944
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:58,029
ton of cooling for every two Gavita

1945
01:12:55,238 --> 01:13:00,158
fixtures in the room another thing I

1946
01:12:58,029 --> 01:13:02,859
will recommend is instead of one large

1947
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,719
rooftop unit so let's say you need 30

1948
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:07,420
tons of cooling in your room I would

1949
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:09,579
recommend that you break that 30 tons up

1950
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:11,859
amongst multiple units so that if you

1951
01:13:09,579 --> 01:13:15,010
have a failure in one unit you can still

1952
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:16,929
run at 3/4 or half of your capacity and

1953
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:19,150
not have to shut down the room if you

1954
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:21,158
can keep it just cool enough to survive

1955
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:22,779
with 3 but you've got for most of the

1956
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:24,879
time one breaks you've still got three

1957
01:13:22,779 --> 01:13:26,408
run and strong if they can push it and

1958
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,810
keep the room cool you're still in

1959
01:13:26,408 --> 01:13:30,129
business if you've got 130 ton unit and

1960
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:31,210
it dies you're [ __ ]

1961
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,800
the lights are gonna turn off because

1962
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,020
it's a hundred degrees in there in no

1963
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:38,349
time so that is my suggestion to you

1964
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:40,270
divide your HVAC into multiple units so

1965
01:13:38,349 --> 01:13:42,670
that when one of your units fails you've

1966
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:46,119
got a major backup plan and trust me

1967
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:48,279
your HVAC units will fail that is my

1968
01:13:46,118 --> 01:13:50,500
number-one complaint in a commercial

1969
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:52,059
facility the HVAC it always takes a

1970
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,069
shift there's always an HVAC issue

1971
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,230
somewhere that I've got to deal with

1972
01:13:54,069 --> 01:13:58,479
that is never a surprise I know a lot of

1973
01:13:56,229 --> 01:14:00,428
HVAC guys on a first name basis I've got

1974
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,738
their name and number right on my phone

1975
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:06,039
a lot of them are on speed dial Siri is

1976
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:07,689
familiar with the HVAC crew so really

1977
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:09,219
don't be a cheap ass when it comes to

1978
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:10,839
HVAC you guys if you're building a home

1979
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:13,779
grow if you're building a commercial

1980
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,090
grow I really recommend you get a good

1981
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:17,920
air conditioner and keep that room nice

1982
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:20,920
and cool your plants will be really

1983
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,529
happy if you get them in the low 70s or

1984
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,699
the high 70s low 80s they will really

1985
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:26,559
show you a difference from what

1986
01:14:24,698 --> 01:14:28,899
had them in the mid-80s you'll see a

1987
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:31,150
huge difference in your production the

1988
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:33,248
quality the terpenes the weight

1989
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:35,439
everything will be better when you cool

1990
01:14:33,248 --> 01:14:37,179
them down a little bit so in a really

1991
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,189
small space you're just gonna have to

1992
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:41,260
use air exchange for cooling that's not

1993
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:43,299
gonna work in a larger space you'll have

1994
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,280
to figure out air conditioning if it's a

1995
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,170
window unit if you're cutting a hole in

1996
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:48,880
the wall and creating a window for a

1997
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:50,260
window unit that's always an option but

1998
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,609
keep in mind it's gonna blow heat out

1999
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:53,889
the other side so you're heating up the

2000
01:14:51,609 --> 01:14:55,179
other side of that wall maybe you've got

2001
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:57,699
yourself one of those portable air

2002
01:14:55,179 --> 01:14:59,800
conditioners I really like those that

2003
01:14:57,698 --> 01:15:01,419
thing has a duct that goes outside do

2004
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,458
the same thing to that duct that I

2005
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,989
recommend you did to your light duct put

2006
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,279
a little panty hose over it to work as a

2007
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:08,319
condom so that you don't get a mouse

2008
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:09,880
climbing up in a gnat or a lizard climb

2009
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,288
it up into that when it's kind of cool

2010
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,550
outside and they feel that warm air

2011
01:15:11,288 --> 01:15:14,469
coming out there like that feels cozy

2012
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:16,840
they just climb right up in there put

2013
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:18,969
something over it to prevent that then

2014
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,760
once we move into a larger grow you may

2015
01:15:18,969 --> 01:15:23,679
need more window units or more portable

2016
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,659
ACS and if those don't cut it there's

2017
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,609
always the mini-split option I kind of

2018
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:30,069
skipped over the mini split a mini split

2019
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:32,018
is a big unit that sits outside and then

2020
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:34,569
it runs conduit through the wall and the

2021
01:15:32,019 --> 01:15:36,400
mini split hangs on the wall you've seen

2022
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:37,929
them it's about three feet long and it

2023
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:39,638
just looks like a vent on the wall and

2024
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:42,038
it is an air conditioner vent that's

2025
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:44,800
part of a mini split I think those run

2026
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:46,478
about 30,000 BTUs of cooling so if

2027
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,389
you've got about eight to ten lights a

2028
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,909
mini split may be ideal and I'm sure

2029
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:53,559
they do make them in stronger models so

2030
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:54,748
then we move up into an industrial dro

2031
01:15:53,559 --> 01:15:57,279
and that's where we start recommending

2032
01:15:54,748 --> 01:16:00,849
rooftop units and again I'm gonna

2033
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:03,969
recommend four to six thousand BTUs of

2034
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:06,130
cooling per Gavita or one half ton of

2035
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:08,050
cooling per Gavita fixtures so for every

2036
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:10,779
two kavita's you hang you do need one

2037
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:12,489
ton of cooling all right so now we know

2038
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,988
how to light the room and get it real

2039
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:15,848
hot and now we've talked about a few

2040
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:18,848
ways to cool the room let's talk a

2041
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:22,150
little bit about air flow and odor

2042
01:16:18,849 --> 01:16:24,309
control if you decide to run ducted

2043
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:26,888
lights or if you decide to run an

2044
01:16:24,309 --> 01:16:29,679
exhaust vent in your room to expel

2045
01:16:26,889 --> 01:16:32,229
humidity or stale air every so often I

2046
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:35,109
would highly recommend you add a carbon

2047
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:37,090
filter to that extraction fan you don't

2048
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:37,939
need to send unfiltered air out of your

2049
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:41,060
grow

2050
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:43,729
most of the cannabis busts happening in

2051
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:46,789
my city are based on a neighbor

2052
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:48,679
complaining of odor a neighbor says hey

2053
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:50,300
that smell is too strong they decide

2054
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,980
which house it's coming from they call

2055
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,260
the cops the cops come they knock on

2056
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:56,119
your door they show up and knock they

2057
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,619
say hey the neighbors say it smells too

2058
01:16:56,119 --> 01:17:00,140
strongly if cannabis here do you have

2059
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:01,430
aggro you either say yes or no that's

2060
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,619
when they make their next move if you

2061
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:04,789
say yes they say can we look did they

2062
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,409
come in and take a look if you've got

2063
01:17:04,789 --> 01:17:08,300
the right amount of plants if you're not

2064
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:09,829
over your account they high-five you and

2065
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,060
they say sorry to bug you and they leave

2066
01:17:09,829 --> 01:17:12,380
and they tell your neighbor shut the

2067
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,140
[ __ ] up he's got enough plants and he's

2068
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,909
ok if you've got too many plants [ __ ]

2069
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,470
goes wrong that's when you probably say

2070
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:20,000
no you can't come in that's when they go

2071
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:22,369
yeah cuz you got so many plants [ __ ]

2072
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,640
and then that's when things escalate so

2073
01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:27,800
my point is odor control don't get

2074
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,480
yourself in trouble by growing stinky

2075
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,539
weed and advertising it to the

2076
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:35,059
neighborhood get a carbon filter get the

2077
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:37,430
appropriate size carbon filter and

2078
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:39,440
blower for your grow space what's your

2079
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:41,390
goal are you blowing it over the lights

2080
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:43,399
to try to cool the lights are you also

2081
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:45,740
using that carbon filter blower and

2082
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:48,170
ducting system to pull air in through

2083
01:17:45,739 --> 01:17:49,670
passive vents in that room while cooling

2084
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,199
those lights because yes that will work

2085
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,609
for you but at the same time you're

2086
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,319
sucking your air conditioning cooling

2087
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:55,639
out of the room at the same time but

2088
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:57,199
also my theory is if that air

2089
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,940
conditioning cooling is also helping

2090
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,319
cool the bulbs as it passes over there I

2091
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:01,669
don't know if that's real or not that's

2092
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,099
kind of the way I have one grow set up

2093
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:06,109
anyway do you need to move a whole bunch

2094
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,970
of air over lights do you need to move

2095
01:18:06,109 --> 01:18:09,799
in a long distance or do you just need

2096
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,020
to run that air through a carbon filter

2097
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,340
and out of the room to get rid of excess

2098
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,780
humidity and if you're gonna do that

2099
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,430
hang your carbon filter up as high as

2100
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:17,659
you can in the middle of the room that's

2101
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,430
where the humidity is hidden that's

2102
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:22,670
where I always recommend the carbon

2103
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:24,500
filter up high but think about your use

2104
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:27,500
of that carbon filter and that blower

2105
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,539
and get the appropriate set up she's got

2106
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,859
a huge blower and a small filter you're

2107
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:32,720
gonna suck a whole bunch of air through

2108
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:34,099
a filter and it's not gonna get filtered

2109
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,990
appropriately and you're gonna blast

2110
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,880
that stank right to the neighborhood

2111
01:18:35,989 --> 01:18:40,550
don't do that so get the appropriate

2112
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:44,060
blower and carbon filter for anything

2113
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:46,190
that is going to exit your grow I can

2114
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,530
recommend the fat filter and the fresh

2115
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:50,929
filter because I have used both of them

2116
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:51,529
they're very similar they both work very

2117
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,289
well

2118
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:56,569
for me they both last about 18 to 24

2119
01:18:54,289 --> 01:18:59,119
months I really didn't see a difference

2120
01:18:56,569 --> 01:19:01,340
in either brand so I only recommend them

2121
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:03,050
because I was satisfied with both of

2122
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:06,110
them they were both affordable and they

2123
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:08,570
both did what I needed them to do so

2124
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:11,119
that's odor control let's talk about

2125
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:12,920
intake we're forcing a bunch of air out

2126
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,989
of this grow room the air conditioner is

2127
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,090
going to send air out of the grow we've

2128
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:19,429
probably got an extractor fan blowing

2129
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:22,130
humidity out of the grow so now we need

2130
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:23,930
to replace some of that air are you

2131
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:26,900
going to do that through a pass event

2132
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:29,510
are you going to use a powered fan to do

2133
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:31,670
that most of your small enclosures your

2134
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,350
closets and probably your small spare

2135
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:36,529
bedrooms are going to have enough

2136
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:38,840
passive vents to allow enough air to get

2137
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:40,729
into that room to replace that air we're

2138
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,710
pulling out it'll probably come in

2139
01:19:40,729 --> 01:19:45,259
through under the door that's a lot more

2140
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:47,779
space than you realize if you calculated

2141
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:49,850
that half inch depth by 3 feet that's a

2142
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:51,649
lot of space so a lot of air can flow

2143
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:54,350
through there so we are replacing a lot

2144
01:19:51,649 --> 01:19:56,599
of that air through there if you want to

2145
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:58,400
replace the air much more quickly you

2146
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,900
can make a hole if you feel like you are

2147
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,949
getting a whistle from under that door

2148
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:02,809
and it's trying to pull the door off

2149
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:04,159
when the air conditioner comes on if

2150
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:05,570
you've got pressure in there or if it's

2151
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,760
trying to blow the door off one or the

2152
01:20:05,569 --> 01:20:10,189
other you may need to relieve some

2153
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,470
pressure one way or another so a past

2154
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:14,149
event may be the way to go just start

2155
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:16,670
with the three inch hole or maybe a four

2156
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:19,369
inch hole somewhere low on the wall I

2157
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:21,380
like to make my intake vents low and my

2158
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:24,529
outtake vents high because the lower air

2159
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:25,940
or the cooler air is lower so just make

2160
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:27,979
a couple of holes and of course you're

2161
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:29,869
gonna have to make that light proof also

2162
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:32,359
so think of a way to make it white proof

2163
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:34,789
and also maybe consider stapling one of

2164
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:37,069
those HEPA filters over it to prevent

2165
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:39,560
any bugs or anything from traveling from

2166
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:41,539
room to room so a past event is really

2167
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,980
easy to do I just put a dryer vent over

2168
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:44,510
it once I've made I think it's a four

2169
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:46,129
inch hole fits perfectly for a dryer

2170
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:47,930
vent so you can just put a little dryer

2171
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:49,100
vent over it and that way no light will

2172
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,180
shine through there and it's also real

2173
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,730
low to the ground so you don't have as

2174
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:54,079
much light risk coming in but put it low

2175
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:55,579
to the ground put the dryer vent over it

2176
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:58,100
you'll be cool at the four inch past

2177
01:20:55,579 --> 01:21:00,050
event into the room so now when the air

2178
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,240
conditioner is blowing out all that

2179
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:03,770
stale air and while your exhaust fan is

2180
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,550
sucking out humidity up top you've got

2181
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,920
some passive

2182
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:08,779
coming in through that hole in the wall

2183
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,219
it doesn't take any electricity or

2184
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:12,170
equipment now if you really want to

2185
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:14,029
blast more air in there get one of those

2186
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:15,770
squirrel cage fans cut a hole in the

2187
01:21:14,029 --> 01:21:17,238
wall about that squirrel cage fan in

2188
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,040
there you can run ducting or however you

2189
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,689
want to do that and just blast more air

2190
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,689
in the room if that's something you want

2191
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:25,578
to do it's probably not necessary now

2192
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:29,000
let's talk a little bit about air flow

2193
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:31,009
we do need to move the air around we

2194
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,770
want air exchange and air flow in the

2195
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:35,329
room at all times we don't need a giant

2196
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:37,130
tornado and they're beating our plants

2197
01:21:35,328 --> 01:21:40,340
up but we do need air movement

2198
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:42,440
constantly in a small drone I like to

2199
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,719
put one fan per light so if you've got a

2200
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:46,279
small bedroom with four lights why not

2201
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,809
hang up four fans

2202
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:49,460
that way you get plenty of airflow you

2203
01:21:47,809 --> 01:21:51,559
don't get any hot spots in there in a

2204
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:53,510
larger grow I understand that is not

2205
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:57,230
reasonable it would not make any sense

2206
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:59,809
to hang a hundred fans in one room I try

2207
01:21:57,229 --> 01:22:01,968
to place a fan about every six to eight

2208
01:21:59,809 --> 01:22:04,039
feet on the wall and depending on the

2209
01:22:01,969 --> 01:22:06,260
height of my tables or my benches or my

2210
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:08,779
canopy that decides where I place my

2211
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,940
fans they're definitely lower than the

2212
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:12,948
lights they'll be just between hopefully

2213
01:22:10,939 --> 01:22:15,078
they'll be between the lights and where

2214
01:22:12,948 --> 01:22:16,729
the top of my canopy ends so if I'm

2215
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:18,649
using a vides I've got a three-foot

2216
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:20,750
space between the light and the top of

2217
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:22,368
the plants some more in that three-foot

2218
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,109
space that's probably where I would have

2219
01:22:22,368 --> 01:22:25,759
my fans probably right at the bottom of

2220
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:28,189
that three-foot space you got kavita's

2221
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,050
three feet and then a fan in another

2222
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:31,908
environment you're probably gonna have a

2223
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:34,099
light and then maybe like a foot maybe

2224
01:22:31,908 --> 01:22:36,109
two and then your fans and then the top

2225
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:37,849
of your plants right there so that's

2226
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:39,618
where you want to hang your fans in a

2227
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:42,650
small environment like I said about one

2228
01:22:39,618 --> 01:22:44,269
fan per light in a larger environment I

2229
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:46,848
know that's not reasonable you're gonna

2230
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:48,739
want to go about one fan every six feet

2231
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:50,690
on the wall and then if you can attach

2232
01:22:48,738 --> 01:22:52,308
fans somewhere in the middle of the room

2233
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:53,118
to some poles or something that will

2234
01:22:52,309 --> 01:22:55,219
always help

2235
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:56,779
we just want airflow we don't need to

2236
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:58,489
beat the plants to death we don't need a

2237
01:22:56,779 --> 01:23:00,229
hurricane in there we just want to move

2238
01:22:58,488 --> 01:23:02,629
that air around we want to rustle the

2239
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:04,308
leaves nice and gently recently I

2240
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:06,770
discovered some fans that mount to the

2241
01:23:04,309 --> 01:23:09,110
ceiling and they actually pull air from

2242
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:11,690
the ground up and they've got a louver

2243
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:13,670
that spreads the air outward so the air

2244
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:15,649
comes from the ground up and then it

2245
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:17,510
spreads it across the ceiling and then

2246
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:18,479
that falls back down I think those are

2247
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:21,050
great fans

2248
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:24,029
for any facility that is using co2

2249
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:25,920
augmentation it'll bring that unused co2

2250
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:27,719
up off the floor and redistribute it

2251
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,670
back amongst the canopy and it also

2252
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,220
creates a lot of airflow in the grow

2253
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:34,380
without excessive wind so look into

2254
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:36,420
those fans if you need more airflow in

2255
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,859
your garden and of course if you're in a

2256
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:39,569
home grow you can get those fans that

2257
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:42,210
are on a stand at Walmart just basic

2258
01:23:39,569 --> 01:23:43,679
stand fans those work great buy them

2259
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,180
right at the start of winter when they

2260
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,409
go on sale go to Lowe's and clean them

2261
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,760
out because they'll be on sale don't try

2262
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:49,739
to buy your fans at the start of summer

2263
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,289
get them in the winter and they are on

2264
01:23:49,739 --> 01:23:55,170
sale in summer they are sold out that's

2265
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:57,539
a grower trick I also like to put fans

2266
01:23:55,170 --> 01:24:00,270
low in the room it wouldn't be odd to

2267
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:02,489
see a fan on the floor in my grow room I

2268
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:04,170
buy those square box fans and just set

2269
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:05,760
one on the floor in the corner blowing

2270
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:07,020
right toward the other corner that's

2271
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,970
just gonna help a little bit more

2272
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:11,400
airflow and airflow is always your

2273
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:13,079
friend also it will help if you spill

2274
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:14,969
some water if you need the floor to dry

2275
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:17,729
a fan is always your friend to help you

2276
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:20,010
dry up a spill alright now we've covered

2277
01:24:17,729 --> 01:24:22,349
lighting we have covered HVAC and

2278
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:23,940
cooling and air flow let's get into the

2279
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:26,120
next couple of details we should think

2280
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:28,109
about humidification and

2281
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:28,890
dehumidification depending on your

2282
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:31,199
location

2283
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:34,289
these may be crucial elements for your

2284
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,809
grow in Colorado we use both I've talked

2285
01:24:34,289 --> 01:24:39,689
about this a lot we have days where it

2286
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:42,150
will be 95 and it will be hot and dry

2287
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:45,299
and then in the night it'll drop to the

2288
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:47,489
high 50s and it will rain we use every

2289
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:49,739
piece of equipment in our HVAC Arsenal

2290
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:51,840
in one day in a commercial grow in

2291
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:53,969
Colorado we will use the heater in the

2292
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,430
morning we will use the air conditioner

2293
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:58,320
all day we will use the dehumidifier all

2294
01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:01,710
night and we will use the humidifier all

2295
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:03,689
day so think about those items if you've

2296
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:06,029
got a small space maybe you can get by

2297
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:07,349
with just a small humidifier like you

2298
01:25:06,029 --> 01:25:09,479
would use for when you're sick or just

2299
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:11,190
to humidify the baby's bedroom or

2300
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:13,289
something like that just get a small one

2301
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:15,089
from Walmart and maybe that'll work for

2302
01:25:13,289 --> 01:25:17,310
like a small tent or maybe a small

2303
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:19,710
bedroom grow when you're moving into a

2304
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:22,789
bigger environment you do need a larger

2305
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:26,850
industrial size industrial use

2306
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:28,529
humidifier or dehumidifier I always say

2307
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:30,450
I don't like to recommend brands but

2308
01:25:28,529 --> 01:25:32,109
when you're entering into the commercial

2309
01:25:30,449 --> 01:25:33,988
dehumidification game

2310
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:36,880
of course going to recommend a quest

2311
01:25:33,988 --> 01:25:39,729
dehumidifier the units on wheels are

2312
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,710
great they are very expensive and very

2313
01:25:39,729 --> 01:25:43,750
inefficient the units that hang from the

2314
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:46,210
ceiling are what I would recommend I

2315
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:48,399
like to set my dehumidifier up on

2316
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:49,779
something like a smart B or a PL girl

2317
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:51,460
unit and have something like that

2318
01:25:49,779 --> 01:25:54,189
trigger it so that you can dial in that

2319
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:55,689
room perfectly do you made a fire knob

2320
01:25:54,189 --> 01:25:58,719
it's got a knob on it turn that almost

2321
01:25:55,689 --> 01:26:00,488
all the way up plug that into a trigger

2322
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,100
that is triggered by another monitoring

2323
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:05,079
device and when you hit the appropriate

2324
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,119
humidity level that thing will trigger

2325
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:08,948
on for you I love setting up a

2326
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:09,908
dehumidifier on some sort of a

2327
01:26:08,948 --> 01:26:12,488
triggering device

2328
01:26:09,908 --> 01:26:14,259
it keeps the rooms dialed in so well you

2329
01:26:12,488 --> 01:26:17,138
need some more to run that water off a

2330
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,260
lot of people say you can use that water

2331
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:21,489
that's collected from a dehumidifier I

2332
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:24,100
stopped doing it because after a while

2333
01:26:21,488 --> 01:26:26,289
the coils and that dehumidifier gather

2334
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:29,409
funk and that funk ends up in your water

2335
01:26:26,289 --> 01:26:31,448
also funky [ __ ] ends up in the tube that

2336
01:26:29,408 --> 01:26:33,039
drains from the dehumidifier into

2337
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:34,719
whatever you're catching it in I've seen

2338
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,460
weird [ __ ] come out of that dehumidifier

2339
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,529
water I don't know what it was we

2340
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:41,109
stopped using it I found it to be unsafe

2341
01:26:38,529 --> 01:26:43,630
and like I said about your HVAC units I

2342
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:45,819
would recommend buying multiple small

2343
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:48,310
dehumidifiers if your budget works for

2344
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:50,979
that instead of one large dehumidifier

2345
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:53,739
for what might be humidifier breaks then

2346
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:55,448
you have a back-up plan you can still at

2347
01:26:53,738 --> 01:26:58,000
least control the humidity a little bit

2348
01:26:55,448 --> 01:27:00,399
with unit number two also make sure you

2349
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,698
keep the filters on your dehumidifiers

2350
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:05,589
clean in a small unit or a large unit it

2351
01:27:03,698 --> 01:27:07,809
will make a huge difference

2352
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,779
so my recommendation for humidification

2353
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:13,119
and dehumidification is to find a unit

2354
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:15,158
that is appropriate for the size space

2355
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:18,039
you are trying to humidify or

2356
01:27:15,158 --> 01:27:20,349
dehumidifier find something that fits

2357
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:22,658
your budget and don't worry too much

2358
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:24,789
about the controls on the unit as long

2359
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:26,289
as it's got an off-and-on we can plug it

2360
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:28,479
into something that will trigger it and

2361
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:30,670
that will help us dial in our humidity

2362
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:32,468
levels right where we want them and if

2363
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:34,420
you want more guidance on humidity

2364
01:27:32,469 --> 01:27:35,980
levels and vapor pressure deficit I

2365
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:38,260
would recommend listening to the vapor

2366
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:42,009
pressure deficit episode that I did a

2367
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:44,560
while back and that is episode 314 vapor

2368
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:45,489
pressure deficit bug poops and testing

2369
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,320
samples coach

2370
01:27:45,488 --> 01:27:48,908
that one out all right you guys I've

2371
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:50,618
been going for about 40 minutes I feel

2372
01:27:48,908 --> 01:27:52,839
like I have given you a lot of

2373
01:27:50,618 --> 01:27:54,939
information to absorb when it comes to

2374
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:57,038
selecting equipment for your new bro

2375
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:58,839
there are still a few details I would

2376
01:27:57,038 --> 01:28:01,210
like to cover but I think I'm going to

2377
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,699
save that for the next episode in the

2378
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,480
next episode we'll talk more about

2379
01:28:02,698 --> 01:28:06,189
controllers what are you gonna plug

2380
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,259
everything into what are we gonna use to

2381
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:10,299
monitor the environment in your room

2382
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:12,940
what are we going to use to trigger your

2383
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,980
humidifier your fans your dehumidifiers

2384
01:28:12,939 --> 01:28:16,388
your extraction fans what are we gonna

2385
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:19,209
use for that sort of stuff we'll also

2386
01:28:16,389 --> 01:28:21,069
talk about pots soil then we'll talk

2387
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:22,960
about nutrients and then we will talk a

2388
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:24,698
little bit about integrated pest

2389
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,069
management and how all of these things

2390
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:28,629
need to work together so I'm gonna start

2391
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:30,788

2442
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,810
somebody has been smoking all of my

2443
01:30:16,409 --> 01:30:19,710
concentrates but I'm pretty sure it was

2444
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,480
me

2445
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,460
I've been going pretty quickly through

2446
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:25,909
this blueberry citron fan brochure this

2447
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,010
stuff is delicious I've described it as

2448
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:31,559
oranges coated in sugar with a hint of

2449
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:33,630
the purple Laffy Taffy maybe a hint of

2450
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,100
blueberry in there it is blueberry and

2451
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:37,680
Clementine so that would make total

2452
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,600
sense it gives me a really nice head

2453
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,579
buzz it keeps me nice and energized and

2454
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,320
it certainly makes me nice and talkative

2455
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:45,269
so it's great podcast dabs

2456
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:47,340
the only bad part is it tastes really

2457
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:49,380
good so I always want to dab more of it

2458
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:51,659
so it's almost gone the good part about

2459
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,550
that is I'll open a fresh concentrate on

2460
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:55,139
the next episode and we will get to talk

2461
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:57,510
about a brand new flavor

2462
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:59,760
all right in this episode we're gonna

2463
01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:01,890
get back on track with the grow lessons

2464
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,079
this will be the fourth episode in a

2465
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:05,850
long series of grow lessons that will

2466
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:08,399
take us from the beginning of the grow

2467
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:10,200
all the way to the end we've already

2468
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,210
done planning your grow we've worked on

2469
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:13,679
selecting your gross space we also

2470
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:15,300
talked a lot about planning your

2471
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,130
equipment we talked a lot about planning

2472
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,230
your lighting your air conditioning and

2473
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:21,270
how to handle air flow now in this

2474
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:22,979
episode we're gonna talk a little bit

2475
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,870
about how to control all of that stuff

2476
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:27,959
and what to plug all of those things

2477
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:30,809
into so let's jump right into selecting

2478
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,310
your equipment part two the first thing

2479
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,500
we'll probably need to think about is

2480
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,150
what are we going to plug the light into

2481
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:38,789
sure you can plug it directly into the

2482
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:41,939
wall now it's gonna be on 24 hours a day

2483
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:44,399
don't rely on yourself or your high

2484
01:31:41,939 --> 01:31:47,849
roommate or maybe your girlfriend

2485
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:49,738
don't rely on anybody but technology to

2486
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:51,780
turn that light off and on at the same

2487
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:54,718
time every day we need consistent light

2488
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:57,329
control so let's talk about a controller

2489
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,789
for that light the easiest route to go

2490
01:31:57,329 --> 01:32:01,859
is just a basic on/off timer that you

2491
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:05,429
can program to be on from a certain time

2492
01:32:01,859 --> 01:32:07,529
and off at another time I recommend

2493
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:09,748
digital timers I like a timer with the

2494
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:12,658
battery backup think about this you've

2495
01:32:09,748 --> 01:32:14,488
got an analog timer an analog timer you

2496
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:16,259
plug it in and you spin it to the

2497
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:18,149
correct time and then he pushed pins

2498
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:19,800
down for when he want the light to come

2499
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:21,929
on and then you leave pins up for when

2500
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,489
you want the light to go off now you set

2501
01:32:21,929 --> 01:32:26,130
it to the correct time and while it's

2502
01:32:23,488 --> 01:32:27,958
plugged in that dial spins and then when

2503
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:29,429
the time comes it clicks the lights to

2504
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:31,679
be appropriate on or off and then he

2505
01:32:29,429 --> 01:32:34,529
keeps spinning if you have a power

2506
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:37,408
interruption that timer stops spinning

2507
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:39,090
so whatever time the power goes out that

2508
01:32:37,408 --> 01:32:40,828
timer thinks it's that time if it goes

2509
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:42,479
out at 3 o'clock it's always three

2510
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:44,969
o'clock until the electricity comes back

2511
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,050
then it starts back up at 3 o'clock the

2512
01:32:44,969 --> 01:32:48,269
lights will come on and they'll run

2513
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:51,059
until they're programmed off cycle if

2514
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:53,489
you have a digital timer with a battery

2515
01:32:51,059 --> 01:32:56,309
backup if you have a power failure the

2516
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:58,169
power goes out at 3 your clock and your

2517
01:32:56,309 --> 01:33:00,360
timer keeps ticking so when the lights

2518
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:02,788
come back on your grow room is still on

2519
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:04,469
the regular schedule and your lights yes

2520
01:33:02,788 --> 01:33:06,328
you did get that dark period from the

2521
01:33:04,469 --> 01:33:08,069
light interruption but you were now back

2522
01:33:06,328 --> 01:33:09,538
on your regular gross ichael so you're

2523
01:33:08,069 --> 01:33:11,788
not gonna throw your whole grow system

2524
01:33:09,538 --> 01:33:13,768
off so I recommend if you're going to

2525
01:33:11,788 --> 01:33:15,958
buy a basic plug-in timer

2526
01:33:13,769 --> 01:33:18,630
I recommend a digital timer with the

2527
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:20,969
battery backup also make sure you get a

2528
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:23,130
timer that is rated to support enough

2529
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:25,948
amperage or voltage for your grow light

2530
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:27,719
so for one light a small plug in timer

2531
01:33:25,948 --> 01:33:29,669
it goes straight into the wall you set

2532
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:31,859
the time on that timer you set your off

2533
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:33,989
and on scheduled times and the light

2534
01:33:31,859 --> 01:33:36,208
will go off and on when you expect it to

2535
01:33:33,988 --> 01:33:39,238
for one light that's a really easy basic

2536
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:42,328
setup you can plug 1,000 watt into that

2537
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:44,848
with no problem in most homes or they do

2538
01:33:42,328 --> 01:33:47,099
make another timer that has two outlets

2539
01:33:44,849 --> 01:33:50,248
on it with that timer you can plug in

2540
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:52,800
probably two 600 s definitely - for

2541
01:33:50,248 --> 01:33:55,139
hundreds maybe in a 4 and a 6 but I

2542
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,659
would not recommend attempting to plug

2543
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:59,400
in 2,000 watts unless you've done some

2544
01:33:57,658 --> 01:34:01,649
electrical upgrades in that home that

2545
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:03,839
will flip the breaker if you try to plug

2546
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:06,029
in 2000 watt lights into one outlet

2547
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,170
without any upgrades you're gonna flip

2548
01:34:06,029 --> 01:34:08,670
the break right now I've said that a

2549
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,899
couple of times in these episodes but I

2550
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:11,219
want you to keep that in mind when

2551
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:13,589
you're thinking about building your grow

2552
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:15,300
a lot of people say no my house will

2553
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:17,189
probably be able to do it no it won't do

2554
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:19,289
your house isn't special you don't have

2555
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:21,030
magic breakers you didn't buy a magic

2556
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:22,949
ballasts you're probably gonna flip

2557
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:25,199
breakers if you put too much electricity

2558
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:27,149
through them and you also start running

2559
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:29,159
a risk of fire everything starts getting

2560
01:34:27,149 --> 01:34:30,599
weak or the more time you flip that

2561
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:31,680
breaker the weaker it's getting which

2562
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,030
also means you're heating up the

2563
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,380
receptacles which also means you're

2564
01:34:33,029 --> 01:34:37,439
heating up the wires you're stressing

2565
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:38,940
everything over time that equals fire so

2566
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,889
just put press in your luck

2567
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:42,989
reduce your amount of lights settle for

2568
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:44,430
having less lighting or pay for the

2569
01:34:42,989 --> 01:34:46,500
electrical upgrades that are required

2570
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:48,450
and here's another idea that people get

2571
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,979
they plug in the timer then they plug in

2572
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:51,899
the power strip and then they plug in

2573
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:53,489
their light and other accessories into

2574
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:55,439
that power strip make sure if you're

2575
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:58,170
gonna do that if that power strip is

2576
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,179
strong enough and rated to support the

2577
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:01,890
voltage and amperage for all of the

2578
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:04,170
electronics you're plugging into there

2579
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:05,670
also you can't plug in another light

2580
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:07,529
despite doing that you're gonna blow up

2581
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:09,300
that timer it's gonna short out or

2582
01:35:07,529 --> 01:35:10,319
you're gonna short out the receptacles

2583
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,779
I've already talked about the things

2584
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,909
that are gonna happen you can plug in an

2585
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:16,979
extension cord or a power strip into

2586
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:18,930
your timer and provide multiple plug in

2587
01:35:16,979 --> 01:35:21,929
spots so they all come on at the same

2588
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:24,300
time but do not overload that power

2589
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:25,800
strip maybe have the light and a fan

2590
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,360
come on at the same time with the power

2591
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,039
strip that's not a bad idea maybe a

2592
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,500
light and too small fans would work for

2593
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,300
you maybe a light a blower and a fan but

2594
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,520
don't think you can outsmart electricity

2595
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,750
don't think you got smart by plugging in

2596
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,090
a power strip and then you were able to

2597
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:40,470
overload that that timer that timer will

2598
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:42,480
just crap out on you and then it'll be

2599
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:44,310
dark or it'll catch on fire they may

2600
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:46,259
just melt all right so let me get back

2601
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:48,600
on track for one light a timer plug

2602
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,250
directly into the wall then the light

2603
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,440
plugged in the back that is perfect for

2604
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:54,180
one light you can also possibly run two

2605
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:56,369
lights if you're running for 600 watt

2606
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:58,230
lights with a dual timer they do make

2607
01:35:56,369 --> 01:35:59,789
that it is available at your gross store

2608
01:35:58,229 --> 01:36:01,229
it may be available at your local

2609
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:02,789
hardware store I'm not sure what's

2610
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:05,369
available to you it is certainly

2611
01:36:02,789 --> 01:36:07,769
available on Amazon of course we always

2612
01:36:05,369 --> 01:36:09,569
recommend you shop locally at a mom and

2613
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:11,880
pop shop avoid those big box stores

2614
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:13,799
recently I've said things like Lowe's

2615
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,630
and Walmart I say that because I know

2616
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,690
you guys have those but if you have a

2617
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:20,699
smaller local shop go there that does

2618
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:22,619
help out all right now we know how to

2619
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:24,989
control one or two lights we just use a

2620
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:26,250
basic horticultural timer plug it into

2621
01:36:24,989 --> 01:36:28,050
the wall plug your light into there

2622
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:30,420
that's real easy now what if we want to

2623
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:31,890
run three maybe four maybe six or eight

2624
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,720
lights what do we do

2625
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:35,400
the first step to that is electrical

2626
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,539
upgrades I'm gonna talk about that a lot

2627
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:38,460
what do we talk about these lessons

2628
01:36:36,539 --> 01:36:40,800
because I don't want you to put yourself

2629
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,390
or your house in danger so electrical

2630
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,250
upgrades if you're gonna do four lights

2631
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:46,410
in a room you will need electrical

2632
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:48,180
upgrades now when you're doing the

2633
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:50,159
electrical upgrades is the time to start

2634
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:52,800
thinking about your lighting controllers

2635
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:54,750
some of them have a plug it looks like

2636
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,909
the plug that plugs into the dryer some

2637
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:58,800
of them are sold with just bare wires at

2638
01:36:56,909 --> 01:37:00,720
the end that you have to hardwire in

2639
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,840
keep that in mind when you're designing

2640
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,280
your space and selecting your controller

2641
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,869
do you want to hardwire your controller

2642
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,969
in is this going to be a permanent

2643
01:37:06,869 --> 01:37:11,460
fixture or do you want something you can

2644
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:13,140
plug into a dryer type plug in and then

2645
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:15,149
maybe you can upgrade or downgrade or

2646
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,350
replace that unit in the future think

2647
01:37:15,149 --> 01:37:17,969
about this now while you're planning

2648
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:20,130
your growth so let's talk about lighting

2649
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:22,530
controllers while we're here what do I

2650
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:24,659
mean by a lighting controller a lighting

2651
01:37:22,529 --> 01:37:26,729
controller is basically a large timer

2652
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:28,769
but like I said it either plugs into the

2653
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:31,139
dryer plug or it's hardwired right in

2654
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:33,720
and it's got multiple plugins on it

2655
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:36,150
where you can plug in four six eight

2656
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,190
I've seen 12 lights on one of these

2657
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:40,649
devices I've seen 24 lights on a flip

2658
01:37:38,189 --> 01:37:42,479
box on lighting controllers a Gavita

2659
01:37:40,649 --> 01:37:44,849
master controller will run forty-eight

2660
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:47,129
lights at one time I believe let's focus

2661
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:49,680
more on something you may find in a home

2662
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:53,130
grow now for a lighting controller any

2663
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:55,170
small home grow you may find a box with

2664
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:57,840
the timer in it with a bunch of plugins

2665
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:59,550
in it with a cord that comes out like I

2666
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,039
said that plugs into the 240 or it's

2667
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:04,739
hardwired in now that one timer will

2668
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:06,960
function all of the plugins on that box

2669
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:09,179
there may also be a switch it will allow

2670
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,949
a couple of those plugins to operate

2671
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:12,900
independently so they can stay on all

2672
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:14,670
the time or you can flip a switch and

2673
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:16,529
they work with the timer some of the

2674
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:18,119
boxes have that some of them don't the

2675
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:20,789
power box is what I'm speaking of

2676
01:38:18,119 --> 01:38:22,890
specifically so basically instead of

2677
01:38:20,789 --> 01:38:24,449
plugging a bunch of timers in and trying

2678
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:26,610
to sync them up and plugging all your

2679
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:28,439
lights into for individual timers you

2680
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:30,210
put up a light controller you set the

2681
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:31,949
timer on that you set the light schedule

2682
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,539
you want on that you either hardwire

2683
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:35,729
that in or you plug it into the dryer

2684
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:38,670
fixture then you plug your grow lights

2685
01:38:35,729 --> 01:38:40,439
into that controller and then when the

2686
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:42,300
scheduled lighting cycle comes on all

2687
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:44,159
four lights come on at once when it goes

2688
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,090
off all four lights go off at once you

2689
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:45,750
don't have to deal with a bunch of

2690
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,130
timers

2691
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,359
you don't have to try to sync up four

2692
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,340
different timers you don't have to try

2693
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:52,469
to fit four timers in one spot and plug

2694
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:54,600
lights into them it's all easy to

2695
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:57,149
program with one unit with one timer

2696
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,060
there are a lot of different brands of

2697
01:38:57,149 --> 01:39:02,519
lighting controllers available earlier I

2698
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:04,620
recommended a digital timer with the

2699
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,380
battery backup I would also recommend

2700
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:10,170
something similar with your controller

2701
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:12,390
they do offer a light controller that

2702
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:14,730
has a timer with the battery in it so if

2703
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:16,829
the power does go out that timer stays

2704
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:19,799
on the same cycle that is always

2705
01:39:16,829 --> 01:39:21,689
advantageous so whether it's digital or

2706
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,699
it's analog on your lighting controller

2707
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:26,099
try to look for one with the battery

2708
01:39:23,698 --> 01:39:28,198
backup so if you do have a power failure

2709
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:30,930
it doesn't throw everything off schedule

2710
01:39:28,198 --> 01:39:32,939
for a home grow or maybe a small garage

2711
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:35,520
grow or something like a shed grow I

2712
01:39:32,939 --> 01:39:38,189
would probably recommend a power box or

2713
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,989
a titan lighting controller I know I

2714
01:39:38,189 --> 01:39:41,339
don't recommend a lot of brands I try to

2715
01:39:39,988 --> 01:39:42,929
stay away from brands but those are

2716
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:45,029
gonna be the two that are most

2717
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:48,300
affordable for somebody trying to get

2718
01:39:45,029 --> 01:39:50,039
into a medium sized grow I often talk

2719
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,440
about a four light room that I work in

2720
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:56,369
in that room it is controlled by a power

2721
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:59,309
box DPC 7500 that's got the dryer plug

2722
01:39:56,369 --> 01:40:01,349
that plugs into a dedicated dryer type

2723
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:04,140
plug in that room then the unit has

2724
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:05,880
spots for four plugins that are synced

2725
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:08,430
up with the timer then there are two

2726
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,319
plugins you have the option of pressing

2727
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:12,810
a switch and those plugins either work

2728
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:15,059
with the timer or they are on continuous

2729
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:16,739
which means they never turn off so in

2730
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:18,989
those four main plugins that work with

2731
01:40:16,738 --> 01:40:21,238
the timer I plug in four lights and

2732
01:40:18,988 --> 01:40:22,889
those other two plugins I've got a fan

2733
01:40:21,238 --> 01:40:24,569
and might may an extraction blower

2734
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:28,199
running so it's all operating off of

2735
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:30,479
that one unit there are a lot of options

2736
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:32,549
when it comes to lighting controllers so

2737
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:34,919
start thinking about that as we design

2738
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:36,600
our grow room we've got to plug our

2739
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,430
lights into something and we've also got

2740
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,380
to keep our lights on as scheduled so a

2741
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:42,780
lighting controller will be a huge

2742
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,369
decision in designing your grow now

2743
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:47,250
let's talk a little bit about your air

2744
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:49,229
conditioner how are you going to control

2745
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:51,119
your air conditioner are you going to

2746
01:40:49,229 --> 01:40:52,279
plug it directly into the wall are you

2747
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,659
gonna plug it into one of those

2748
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:56,579
accessory switches on the power box that

2749
01:40:54,659 --> 01:40:59,458
is constantly on and then at that point

2750
01:40:56,579 --> 01:41:01,439
are you going to use the thermostat

2751
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:03,779
on the air-conditioner and rely on that

2752
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,579
or are we going to plug the

2753
01:41:03,779 --> 01:41:08,069
air-conditioner into another trigger

2754
01:41:05,578 --> 01:41:09,599
device that has a sensor that hangs in

2755
01:41:08,069 --> 01:41:11,728
the middle of the room and pays

2756
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:14,519
attention to the temperature there those

2757
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:16,260
are a few things to think about so when

2758
01:41:14,519 --> 01:41:18,449
you are buying your air conditioner if

2759
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:21,329
you plan on plugging it into another

2760
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:24,268
triggering device make sure you buy an

2761
01:41:21,328 --> 01:41:26,429
analog air conditioner with analog

2762
01:41:24,269 --> 01:41:28,829
controllers like a knob that clicks like

2763
01:41:26,429 --> 01:41:31,349
a high medium low some of your digital

2764
01:41:28,828 --> 01:41:34,380
air conditioners won't work if you try

2765
01:41:31,349 --> 01:41:35,849
to trigger them with another device so

2766
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:38,519
here's how it will work you will have a

2767
01:41:35,849 --> 01:41:40,949
switch that plugs into the wall that

2768
01:41:38,519 --> 01:41:42,900
switch will have a setting that says I

2769
01:41:40,948 --> 01:41:45,538
want this device to come on when the

2770
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:47,429
temperature gets this high I want this

2771
01:41:45,538 --> 01:41:49,198
device to go off when the temperature

2772
01:41:47,429 --> 01:41:51,420
gets this low so it's just a little

2773
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:53,308
range that you said then that thing has

2774
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:55,380
a cord that hangs in the center of the

2775
01:41:53,309 --> 01:41:56,820
room with a thermometer so now we're

2776
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:58,769
getting the temperatures from the center

2777
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:01,228
of the room instead of where that air

2778
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:02,729
conditioner is located now we can

2779
01:42:01,229 --> 01:42:05,010
actually take a reading from the plant

2780
01:42:02,729 --> 01:42:06,809
area instead of that one wall where the

2781
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:08,248
air conditioner is sitting so now the

2782
01:42:06,809 --> 01:42:09,748
air conditioner is plugged into this cap

2783
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:11,279
switch the switch is reading from the

2784
01:42:09,748 --> 01:42:13,469
middle of the room now what's gonna

2785
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:15,029
happen it's gonna say oh it's reached

2786
01:42:13,469 --> 01:42:16,559
the temperature we want let's turn it

2787
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:18,090
off it doesn't reach up and hit the off

2788
01:42:16,559 --> 01:42:19,920
switch on the air conditioner it simply

2789
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:22,469
cuts off the power so now there's no

2790
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,809
power everything has reset on your

2791
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:27,059
digital device when it comes back on is

2792
01:42:24,809 --> 01:42:29,010
that digital air conditioner gonna come

2793
01:42:27,059 --> 01:42:30,510
back on in the previous setting or is it

2794
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,130
just gonna come back on and blink and

2795
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:34,170
wait for human interaction to tell it

2796
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:37,078
what to do that's the downfall of

2797
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:39,179
digital devices if you only plan to

2798
01:42:37,078 --> 01:42:41,549
trigger your air conditioner with the

2799
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:44,038
air conditioners onboard controls you

2800
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:45,989
can get a digital air conditioner if you

2801
01:42:44,038 --> 01:42:49,109
plan to run your air conditioner through

2802
01:42:45,988 --> 01:42:51,718
another triggering device I recommend an

2803
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:53,728
analogue air conditioner I will make the

2804
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:57,239
same recommendation when it comes to

2805
01:42:53,729 --> 01:42:59,159
humidifiers and dehumidifiers if you

2806
01:42:57,238 --> 01:43:01,049
want to plug them into the wall and let

2807
01:42:59,158 --> 01:43:03,268
them work off their own functions off

2808
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:05,699
their own settings you can do that and

2809
01:43:03,269 --> 01:43:08,248
that will be just fine for a tent or a

2810
01:43:05,698 --> 01:43:11,308
small room if you really want to dial it

2811
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:13,170
in I recommend something that can take a

2812
01:43:11,309 --> 01:43:15,239
humidity measurement from the middle

2813
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,980
of the room like I talked about earlier

2814
01:43:15,238 --> 01:43:18,718
with the air conditioner

2815
01:43:16,979 --> 01:43:20,369
you would have a cap switch that plugs

2816
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,859
into the wall this would have a

2817
01:43:20,369 --> 01:43:24,269
humidistat controller on it it would say

2818
01:43:22,859 --> 01:43:27,210
when the humidity gets to this point

2819
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,230
activate this power this device it

2820
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,429
doesn't even know it's plugged into

2821
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:31,559
there it just knows that it needs to

2822
01:43:29,429 --> 01:43:34,469
power that switch when the humidity gets

2823
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:37,410
below here turn that switch off that cap

2824
01:43:34,469 --> 01:43:38,939
switch then has a humidistat on a cord

2825
01:43:37,409 --> 01:43:41,279
that we can hang in the center of the

2826
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:42,960
room that way we can get our humidity

2827
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:44,939
measurement from a more appropriate

2828
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,500
place instead of down on the corner on

2829
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:49,259
the floor where the humidifier or

2830
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:50,850
dehumidifier is located so we've got a

2831
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:53,100
cap switch it's plugged into the wall

2832
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:55,920
it's got settings on it it's got a

2833
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:58,380
courted humidity reader on it that hangs

2834
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,840
in the center of the room then we plug

2835
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:03,210
our humidifier or dehumidifier into that

2836
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:05,310
cap switch and it is activated by the

2837
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:07,469
readings from the center of the room

2838
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:09,660
these extra controllers are not

2839
01:44:07,469 --> 01:44:12,630
necessary but if you really want to dial

2840
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:14,789
in your room to a precise humidity range

2841
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:17,250
and a temperature range and get that

2842
01:44:14,789 --> 01:44:19,500
vapor pressure deficit dialed in for

2843
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:21,869
your plants these types of devices are

2844
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:24,060
what you're going to need they may cap

2845
01:44:21,869 --> 01:44:26,340
switches to trigger everything you can

2846
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:28,380
trigger your fans your blowers you can

2847
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:31,380
set up cap switches to trigger any type

2848
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:33,600
of grow room equipment if your equipment

2849
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:36,390
is compatible you need the type of

2850
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,610
air-conditioner dehumidifier and/or

2851
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:40,619
humidifier that has a knob where you can

2852
01:44:38,609 --> 01:44:42,599
set too high and then you can plug those

2853
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:44,609
into other devices that will control

2854
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,679
them that way when they're necessary

2855
01:44:44,609 --> 01:44:47,880
they just come on at their highest and

2856
01:44:46,679 --> 01:44:49,920
they activate and then when you reach

2857
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,130
the parameters you need they turn off

2858
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,960
for that to work we need devices that

2859
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:57,239
can handle power interruptions that

2860
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,310
won't reset their settings when they

2861
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:02,389
come back on now that's the basic

2862
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:05,100
equipment to set up an analog grow room

2863
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:06,690
now let's talk about automating things a

2864
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:09,630
little more and also giving ourselves

2865
01:45:06,689 --> 01:45:12,599
the ability to make adjustments from a

2866
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:15,270
remote location and also turn off and on

2867
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:17,070
equipment from remote locations we'll be

2868
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:19,410
able to monitor our grow and make

2869
01:45:17,069 --> 01:45:21,149
changes on the fly with some of the

2870
01:45:19,409 --> 01:45:23,159
advanced technology that is available

2871
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:25,559
for our grow room let's talk a little

2872
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:26,609
bit about that stuff there are several

2873
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,830
options for

2874
01:45:26,609 --> 01:45:32,039
setting up a more automated grow room

2875
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:34,529
through technology I'm trying to avoid

2876
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:37,019
pitching specific brands and specific

2877
01:45:34,529 --> 01:45:39,569
products here but for this example I'm

2878
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:41,429
going to use a specific piece of

2879
01:45:39,569 --> 01:45:43,948
equipment and a specific brand of

2880
01:45:41,429 --> 01:45:46,440
equipment to paint a picture of how we

2881
01:45:43,948 --> 01:45:48,388
can set up an automated grow room I have

2882
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:50,189
a lot of experience with this device and

2883
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:52,739
with this equipment so it makes it easy

2884
01:45:50,189 --> 01:45:54,839
for me to draw the plan in my head which

2885
01:45:52,738 --> 01:45:57,689
makes it easier for me to kind of convey

2886
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,880
the idea to you this is an example of

2887
01:45:57,689 --> 01:46:02,099
how I set up the automation at a recent

2888
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:04,679
facility I worked with and I'm gonna try

2889
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:07,139
to stay away from mentioning brand names

2890
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:09,510
and proprietary specific names of their

2891
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:11,789
devices but this is how we do it

2892
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:14,460
this brand comes with their product

2893
01:46:11,789 --> 01:46:17,789
comes with a brain that brain syncs up

2894
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:20,130
through Wi-Fi to your cell phone you set

2895
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:22,859
up an account you create a password then

2896
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:25,170
you design your grow rooms if you've got

2897
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:27,509
a bedroom just go bake bedroom if you've

2898
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:30,239
got two bedrooms make two bedrooms give

2899
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:32,909
them a name then you enter your flower

2900
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:34,229
rooms flower a flower B flower C however

2901
01:46:32,908 --> 01:46:38,069
you want to do it you just type them in

2902
01:46:34,229 --> 01:46:40,079
and you create the rooms then you select

2903
01:46:38,069 --> 01:46:41,639
a room on the application if you're

2904
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:43,260
doing a small home grow it's probably

2905
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:45,389
just the flower room the one room that

2906
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:47,489
you've got now that's where the next fun

2907
01:46:45,389 --> 01:46:49,380
piece of equipment comes in the next

2908
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:51,149
piece of equipment looks like a basic

2909
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:53,550
power strip it's got a plug that plugs

2910
01:46:51,149 --> 01:46:56,460
into the wall and then it has four

2911
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:58,800
available plug in spots it plugs into

2912
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:01,739
the wall and now it connects wirelessly

2913
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:04,860
to that brain unit that is connected to

2914
01:47:01,738 --> 01:47:07,079
your phone now that power strip has four

2915
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:10,439
slots in it that are numbered one two

2916
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:12,510
three and four now you open up the

2917
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:13,769
application on your phone and it will

2918
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,780
show you that you have plugged in that

2919
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:17,969
power strip it knows it's there the app

2920
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:19,529
is found at the brain says hey this is

2921
01:47:17,969 --> 01:47:21,779
here what do you want me to do with it

2922
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:23,670
you add it you say that is in room one

2923
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:25,380
you assign it to a room number now

2924
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:27,420
you're already got a room started with a

2925
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:29,760
piece of equipment in there now it's got

2926
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:32,039
four slots on it you can assign each of

2927
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,469
those four slots to be a different piece

2928
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:37,079
of equipment so I would say slot one is

2929
01:47:34,469 --> 01:47:38,368
my lights and now you just it's really

2930
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:39,658
easy to scroll through there's a little

2931
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:42,089
dial it says what is

2932
01:47:39,658 --> 01:47:44,009
plugged into slot one is an HVAC is it a

2933
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:46,078
light is an irrigation it's real easy

2934
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:47,789
it's a light cool no problem

2935
01:47:46,078 --> 01:47:49,438
you just hold it slot number one is

2936
01:47:47,788 --> 01:47:51,509
light slot number two is an air

2937
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:53,579
conditioner slot number three is the

2938
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:55,168
blower and slot number 4 is a

2939
01:47:53,578 --> 01:47:57,448
dehumidifier we're just being

2940
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:59,908
hypothetical here so once you've got all

2941
01:47:57,448 --> 01:48:02,219
of the devices assigned to that power

2942
01:47:59,908 --> 01:48:04,799
strip you go to the room and set

2943
01:48:02,219 --> 01:48:06,840
settings for the room so our light is

2944
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,279
plugged into spot number one you just go

2945
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,248
to lighting and you set a lighting

2946
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:14,069
schedule and you hit save and now slot 1

2947
01:48:11,248 --> 01:48:15,929
will act accordingly to the schedule you

2948
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:18,658
have just set so the air conditioner is

2949
01:48:15,929 --> 01:48:20,279
slot 2 you just go to HVAC then you tell

2950
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:22,498
it I want it to stay this temperature in

2951
01:48:20,279 --> 01:48:25,050
here so if it gets too hot it'll fire up

2952
01:48:22,498 --> 01:48:27,389
slot number 2 on that power strip and

2953
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:31,320
each spot on that power strip will act

2954
01:48:27,389 --> 01:48:33,300
as program how does it know what to do

2955
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:35,488
because there's another device in the

2956
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:38,369
box that hangs in the very center of the

2957
01:48:35,488 --> 01:48:40,888
room and this device has a light

2958
01:48:38,368 --> 01:48:44,458
temperature and humidity sensor that

2959
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:46,739
takes reading every 15 seconds so every

2960
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:48,809
15 seconds it takes a fresh reading and

2961
01:48:46,738 --> 01:48:51,978
it sends the information back to the

2962
01:48:48,809 --> 01:48:54,809
brain unit and the brain says ok so it's

2963
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:56,849
9 a.m. which means the lights need to be

2964
01:48:54,809 --> 01:48:58,650
on so I'll keep that switch on it's

2965
01:48:56,849 --> 01:49:00,208
gotten up to 84 degrees in here so I

2966
01:48:58,649 --> 01:49:02,158
need to turn on the air conditioner and

2967
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:03,538
let's check on the humidity humidity is

2968
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:05,368
cool so we don't need to turn on that

2969
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:06,719
device and the fan that goes with the

2970
01:49:05,368 --> 01:49:09,238
air conditioner so that came on to

2971
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:10,979
probably so now your lights are on their

2972
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:13,168
conditioners on the fans blown around

2973
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:15,059
that dehumidifier doesn't need to be on

2974
01:49:13,168 --> 01:49:16,979
so it's just chilling and every 15

2975
01:49:15,059 --> 01:49:18,900
seconds that units gonna keep taking

2976
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:20,458
measurements and then once it sees that

2977
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:22,529
we've gotten down to the parameters

2978
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:24,359
we've programmed in then it will turn

2979
01:49:22,529 --> 01:49:26,248
off that air conditioner that fan will

2980
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:28,168
turn off the lights will stay on and

2981
01:49:26,248 --> 01:49:30,809
that dehumidifier will be right there on

2982
01:49:28,168 --> 01:49:32,760
standby for when we need it the unit I'm

2983
01:49:30,809 --> 01:49:35,248
talking about also has the ability to

2984
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,958
measure the moisture content in your

2985
01:49:35,248 --> 01:49:38,698
medium if you're running rock wool cubes

2986
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:40,738
if you're running cocoa if you're

2987
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:43,109
running soil whatever type of medium

2988
01:49:40,738 --> 01:49:45,388
you're working in this device has the

2989
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:48,898
ability to measure the moisture content

2990
01:49:45,389 --> 01:49:51,239
in your medium that means you can set up

2991
01:49:48,899 --> 01:49:53,139
automated irrigation when the plants

2992
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:56,089
reach a certain dry

2993
01:49:53,139 --> 01:49:57,618
how does that work it's fairly easy you

2994
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,659
put these little sticks in your medium

2995
01:49:57,618 --> 01:50:02,208
and you calibrate them they link up to

2996
01:49:59,658 --> 01:50:04,578
the water content sensor controller

2997
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:07,760
which wirelessly hooks up to the brain

2998
01:50:04,578 --> 01:50:09,469
which wirelessly relays to your phone so

2999
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:12,199
that moisture content meter is

3000
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:14,208
constantly every 15 seconds taking a

3001
01:50:12,198 --> 01:50:16,069
moisture meter in your medium it's

3002
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:17,689
sending that reading up to the little

3003
01:50:16,069 --> 01:50:19,219
brain which is sending it back to the

3004
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:21,078
main brain which is sending it to your

3005
01:50:19,219 --> 01:50:23,269
phone now if you have the equipment

3006
01:50:21,078 --> 01:50:25,488
installed you can go to that room you

3007
01:50:23,269 --> 01:50:27,679
can open the irrigation tab on your

3008
01:50:25,488 --> 01:50:30,169
phone and you can tell it to water that

3009
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,940
room when it gets to a certain dryness

3010
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:33,949
and you can tell it to water for a

3011
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:36,049
certain amount of time or until it

3012
01:50:33,948 --> 01:50:37,848
reaches a certain moisture level

3013
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:39,949
basically the way you would do that you

3014
01:50:37,849 --> 01:50:42,050
would plug your irrigation pump into

3015
01:50:39,948 --> 01:50:43,638
that power strip I spoke of earlier or

3016
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:45,590
you can add another one of their

3017
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:47,840
specified power strips that syncs up

3018
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:49,729
wirelessly to the brain which then syncs

3019
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,769
wirelessly to your phone so you plug

3020
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:54,979
your irrigation pump into that you go to

3021
01:50:51,769 --> 01:50:57,260
the irrigation tab in the application

3022
01:50:54,979 --> 01:50:59,030
and you tell it when to water and then

3023
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:01,309
when the plants get dry it simply sends

3024
01:50:59,029 --> 01:51:02,509
electricity to plug number four or

3025
01:51:01,309 --> 01:51:04,880
whichever plug you assigned as

3026
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:06,679
irrigation it'll activate that it will

3027
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,569
start watering once it gets wet enough

3028
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:11,479
it will know because it's got a moisture

3029
01:51:08,569 --> 01:51:13,219
content sensor in your medium and it

3030
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:14,659
will say wet enough and it will send a

3031
01:51:13,219 --> 01:51:16,939
signal to the brain and it will

3032
01:51:14,658 --> 01:51:19,549
discontinue powering your irrigation

3033
01:51:16,939 --> 01:51:21,768
pump now there are a lot of ways to

3034
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:23,510
irrigate your system maybe you're

3035
01:51:21,769 --> 01:51:24,979
running a flood and drain system maybe

3036
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:27,019
that will just tell it when to flood and

3037
01:51:24,979 --> 01:51:28,729
drain maybe you're running pots with an

3038
01:51:27,019 --> 01:51:30,769
automated drip system like we talked

3039
01:51:28,729 --> 01:51:33,380
about in another episode however you do

3040
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:35,599
it basically you are just triggering the

3041
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:37,909
pump to come on and it knows when to

3042
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:40,909
come on because we've got those moisture

3043
01:51:37,908 --> 01:51:43,308
content sensors pressed into our medium

3044
01:51:40,908 --> 01:51:45,138
at specified intervals and the unit I'm

3045
01:51:43,309 --> 01:51:47,599
talking about allows you to have six

3046
01:51:45,139 --> 01:51:49,819
different water probes in different

3047
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:52,309
locations hooked up to one unit so there

3048
01:51:49,819 --> 01:51:54,708
are six wired probes that go back to one

3049
01:51:52,309 --> 01:51:56,748
unit that one unit then wirelessly sends

3050
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:58,819
the data back to the brain that brain

3051
01:51:56,748 --> 01:52:01,010
relays it to your phone so once we've

3052
01:51:58,819 --> 01:52:02,738
dialed in automated lighting automated

3053
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:05,310
air conditioning automated

3054
01:52:02,738 --> 01:52:07,289
dehumidification and humid

3055
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:09,780
and now we've got automated irrigation

3056
01:52:07,289 --> 01:52:13,220
we have almost got a fully automated

3057
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:16,229
grow room with very basic equipment and

3058
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:18,810
honestly not a huge budget if you shop

3059
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:20,189
smart I know it's exciting to get

3060
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:21,900
everything automated you want it all

3061
01:52:20,189 --> 01:52:23,699
dialed in you want it just to happen

3062
01:52:21,899 --> 01:52:25,139
it's fun watching the Machine happen I

3063
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:26,760
would just stand in the corner of the

3064
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:28,560
grow room and look at a timer and go so

3065
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,640
in about 10 seconds and you would know

3066
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:31,560
that that's gonna switch off that

3067
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:33,360
thing's gonna go that's gonna happen all

3068
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,500
the bells are gonna happen the whistles

3069
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:36,229
are gonna happen it's like a big game a

3070
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:39,090
mousetrap it feels really great to watch

3071
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:42,239
with all that being said some of my

3072
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:44,250
favorite advice is keep it simple stupid

3073
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:46,199
I know I'm calling you stupid

3074
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:48,479
but that's the way the saying goes keep

3075
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:50,189
it simple stoner how's that feel better

3076
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:52,889
keep it simple stoner we don't need to

3077
01:52:50,189 --> 01:52:55,409
make everything elaborate a small grow

3078
01:52:52,890 --> 01:52:58,289
does not need a lot of equipment the

3079
01:52:55,409 --> 01:53:01,199
more electronics you have the more knobs

3080
01:52:58,289 --> 01:53:03,810
and dials and bells and whistles you've

3081
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:05,849
got the more [ __ ] can go wrong if you've

3082
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:07,740
got a light and a fan and an air

3083
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:09,900
conditioner and some way to pull stale

3084
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:12,659
air and heat out of that room you have

3085
01:53:09,899 --> 01:53:14,069
got all you need of course it is fun to

3086
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:15,930
trick out the room it's fun to have

3087
01:53:14,069 --> 01:53:18,149
accessories it's fun to have toys and

3088
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:21,420
it's also going to improve your quality

3089
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:23,279
if you dial it in properly don't spend

3090
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:25,440
money on a bunch of toys just to have

3091
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:27,420
them think about what you need think

3092
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,849
about what's necessity and think about

3093
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:32,579
the order in which you need your new

3094
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:34,410
toys I'm gonna kind of skip off of my

3095
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:36,210
notes here and I'm gonna say instead of

3096
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:38,760
spending a whole bunch of money on some

3097
01:53:36,210 --> 01:53:41,159
automation why not buy yourself a better

3098
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:44,340
pH pan who's gonna talk later about pH

3099
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:46,559
pins and EC meters but now's a good time

3100
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,050
instead of spending a lot of money on

3101
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,550
automation you need a quality pH pen

3102
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:52,800
your plants are gonna look like [ __ ]

3103
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:54,390
without proper pH so if you're putting

3104
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,949
together a budget and you're trying to

3105
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:58,800
include Auto watering and you're trying

3106
01:53:55,949 --> 01:54:00,659
to decide between a quality pH pin or

3107
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,630
maybe some fancy auto watering stuff I

3108
01:54:00,659 --> 01:54:05,849
highly recommend you go with a good pH

3109
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:08,430
pen you need that from the beginning

3110
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:10,620
you can add auto watering later you can

3111
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:12,810
buy fancy or toys later if you're on a

3112
01:54:10,619 --> 01:54:15,029
tight budget get the necessities first

3113
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:16,500
and then we can expand in the future if

3114
01:54:15,029 --> 01:54:18,149
you don't have the right stuff you're

3115
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,448
not gonna have a quality product and

3116
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:20,248
it's

3117
01:54:18,448 --> 01:54:22,109
all going to be a giant waste of money

3118
01:54:20,248 --> 01:54:24,448
all right we've talked about controlling

3119
01:54:22,109 --> 01:54:25,799
everything here's something that I want

3120
01:54:24,448 --> 01:54:27,388
to include but I'm not sure where it

3121
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,409
fits in so I'm just gonna tag it in

3122
01:54:27,389 --> 01:54:31,109
right here

3123
01:54:28,408 --> 01:54:33,899
what about co2 augmentation maybe you

3124
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:36,029
want to add co2 to your grow room this

3125
01:54:33,899 --> 01:54:38,698
is probably going to require you making

3126
01:54:36,029 --> 01:54:41,189
extra trips to either the gross store or

3127
01:54:38,698 --> 01:54:43,049
the commercial gas place our local place

3128
01:54:41,189 --> 01:54:45,448
here is called air gas you're gonna have

3129
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:47,550
to buy or rent a container you're gonna

3130
01:54:45,448 --> 01:54:49,138
have to get that refilled as frequently

3131
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:51,538
as you need it I don't know how often

3132
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:52,979
it's going to need to be refilled in

3133
01:54:51,538 --> 01:54:55,109
your environment I don't know how well

3134
01:54:52,979 --> 01:54:57,059
sealed your room is I don't know how

3135
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:58,679
much co2 your room starts with I don't

3136
01:54:57,059 --> 01:55:00,630
know how much co2 you're trying to get

3137
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:02,819
it to I don't know how often you'll need

3138
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:05,279
your containers filled but for co2

3139
01:55:02,819 --> 01:55:08,429
augmentation you're going to need either

3140
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:10,408
those big tanks or a co2 burner which

3141
01:55:08,429 --> 01:55:13,349
will have to be hardwired into your

3142
01:55:10,408 --> 01:55:15,058
natural gas lines so tanks are probably

3143
01:55:13,349 --> 01:55:17,429
the easiest way to go you'll have to get

3144
01:55:15,059 --> 01:55:19,708
the tanks get them to the room if you're

3145
01:55:17,429 --> 01:55:21,479
not an able-bodied person this could be

3146
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:24,029
challenging the larger tanks are hard

3147
01:55:21,479 --> 01:55:26,039
for me to move the smaller tanks are not

3148
01:55:24,029 --> 01:55:28,139
light either so once you've got the

3149
01:55:26,038 --> 01:55:30,630
tanks to the room now you require a

3150
01:55:28,139 --> 01:55:32,190
regulator that screws on to the nozzle

3151
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:33,929
on the tank it'll be obvious when you've

3152
01:55:32,189 --> 01:55:35,969
got the tank and the regulator you will

3153
01:55:33,929 --> 01:55:37,769
see where that goes you screw on the

3154
01:55:35,969 --> 01:55:40,109
regulator there are a couple of knobs

3155
01:55:37,769 --> 01:55:42,389
you've got to turn be you've got to open

3156
01:55:40,109 --> 01:55:43,408
the tank turn the gas onto the tank now

3157
01:55:42,389 --> 01:55:45,900
it's gonna be flowing through the

3158
01:55:43,408 --> 01:55:47,998
regulator that regulator has a valve you

3159
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:50,429
can turn it will allow gas to flow

3160
01:55:47,998 --> 01:55:52,859
through the lines there are lines that

3161
01:55:50,429 --> 01:55:55,590
attach to the regulator hang those lines

3162
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:57,868
high in your grow I like to hang them

3163
01:55:55,590 --> 01:56:00,078
right about the height of the lights co2

3164
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:02,518
is a gas that is heavier than oxygen

3165
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:05,009
that co2 is gonna pump through those

3166
01:56:02,519 --> 01:56:07,050
lines and it will fall right down to the

3167
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:09,510
plants and become available for the

3168
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:11,579
plants now how do we know how much co2

3169
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:15,119
is in the room that's when co2 gets

3170
01:56:11,578 --> 01:56:17,819
expensive you need a co2 monitor you can

3171
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:19,439
get a standalone co2 monitor or this

3172
01:56:17,819 --> 01:56:21,478
will work right into the automated

3173
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:24,928
system I was talking about earlier there

3174
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:27,329
is a tab for co2 so we need a co2

3175
01:56:24,929 --> 01:56:29,010
monitor whether a standalone unit or

3176
01:56:27,328 --> 01:56:31,408
unit that's combined with our other

3177
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:32,250
monitoring and triggering system now

3178
01:56:31,408 --> 01:56:34,609
you're more expensive

3179
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:37,949
co2 monitors will also have a co2

3180
01:56:34,609 --> 01:56:40,439
controller these co2 controllers work

3181
01:56:37,949 --> 01:56:42,659
very similarly to the cap controllers I

3182
01:56:40,439 --> 01:56:44,399
talked about earlier there are a lot of

3183
01:56:42,659 --> 01:56:46,289
different brands and styles available

3184
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:48,899
most of them will have a screen on that

3185
01:56:46,289 --> 01:56:51,840
screen you can set the level that you

3186
01:56:48,899 --> 01:56:53,670
want the co2 to reach in that room some

3187
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,159
of the more advanced models will also

3188
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:57,840
give you the option to set a schedule so

3189
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:59,670
that it comes on only when the lights

3190
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,199
are on and it does not come on when the

3191
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:03,659
lights are off we don't need to add co2

3192
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:05,250
when the lights are off so you'll be

3193
01:57:03,659 --> 01:57:07,019
able to set the level you want the co2

3194
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:10,289
to reach and you'll be able to set a

3195
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:12,240
schedule now this co2 monitor has a cord

3196
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:14,729
hanging off of it which plugs into the

3197
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:17,279
wall or your power source now the plug

3198
01:57:14,729 --> 01:57:19,739
that plugs into the wall has a piggyback

3199
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,439
that you can just plug your co2

3200
01:57:19,739 --> 01:57:24,389
regulator directly into so now that

3201
01:57:22,439 --> 01:57:26,460
thing's going to monitor the level of

3202
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:28,590
co2 in the room and when it needs

3203
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:31,079
electricity triggered to the co2

3204
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:33,360
regulator it will just fire up and let

3205
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:35,369
the co2 regulator know to come on the

3206
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:36,929
co2 regulator will pump gas down those

3207
01:57:35,369 --> 01:57:39,090
lines that you've got hung above the

3208
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:40,890
canopy and then once that co2 regulator

3209
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:42,869
says oh it's enough it'll turn that

3210
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:45,570
right off for you so that is the best

3211
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:48,329
way in my opinion to set up co2 in a

3212
01:57:45,569 --> 01:57:50,069
small grow that's very similar to the

3213
01:57:48,329 --> 01:57:52,140
way it's done in a large commercial grow

3214
01:57:50,069 --> 01:57:54,029
we do the same lines above the canopy of

3215
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:55,289
course the lines are much longer and of

3216
01:57:54,029 --> 01:57:57,509
course we're not running to the gross

3217
01:57:55,289 --> 01:57:59,460
store to refill our canisters all the

3218
01:57:57,510 --> 01:58:01,920
time we have a truck that comes and they

3219
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:03,930
actually link up to a giant set of

3220
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,600
canisters outside there are about a

3221
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:08,430
dozen six-foot-tall canisters outside

3222
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,980
that the truck fills for us that lasts

3223
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:12,480
about half a week maybe a little less

3224
01:58:10,979 --> 01:58:15,419
depending on how many of the rooms are

3225
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:16,769
in full flower but it's very similar to

3226
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:19,289
the way it's done in a commercial

3227
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:21,390
facility now if you don't want to use

3228
01:58:19,289 --> 01:58:24,420
the co2 monitor I understand they're

3229
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:24,960
expensive you can put the regulator on a

3230
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,359
timer

3231
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:30,149
but when you do that how do you know how

3232
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:32,549
much co2 is in that room how do you know

3233
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:34,289
if you even need to add co2 how do you

3234
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:36,239
know if you haven't overdone it and

3235
01:58:34,289 --> 01:58:38,880
you're not wasting co2 at this point I

3236
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:40,260
think the co2 monitor is really worth

3237
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,900
the money you're gonna spend because

3238
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:45,210
then you can save on co2 in the long run

3239
01:58:42,899 --> 01:58:46,189
you won't be overdoing it you won't be

3240
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:48,170
wasting sea

3241
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:49,819
you you want to be blasting co2 into the

3242
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:51,859
room and wondering what's in there I

3243
01:58:49,819 --> 01:58:53,479
like knowing what's happening in my grow

3244
01:58:51,859 --> 01:58:55,819
rooms if they're big if they're small

3245
01:58:53,479 --> 01:58:57,529
it's always better to take good notes

3246
01:58:55,819 --> 01:58:59,689
and understand what is happening in

3247
01:58:57,529 --> 01:59:00,979
there instead of just blasting something

3248
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,839
that you're paying a lot of money for

3249
01:59:00,979 --> 01:59:05,448
and not understanding any type of

3250
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:08,390
results so if I'm paying money for co2 I

3251
01:59:05,448 --> 01:59:10,369
would like to have a co2 monitor just to

3252
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:12,350
see some sort of number go up just to

3253
01:59:10,369 --> 01:59:14,149
see my money turn into something even if

3254
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:17,120
it's just a number on that monitor I

3255
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:20,029
want to see some kind of result so that

3256
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:22,340
is my quick sidebar on co2 augmentation

3257
01:59:20,029 --> 01:59:23,750
and co2 equipment I feel like that fit

3258
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:26,329
perfectly right there

3259
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:28,850
I feel like this series of grow lessons

3260
01:59:26,329 --> 01:59:30,649
is off to a great start we've got some

3261
01:59:28,850 --> 01:59:32,989
goals in mind for the grow we know what

3262
01:59:30,649 --> 01:59:34,399
to expect from the grow we know where to

3263
01:59:32,988 --> 01:59:36,229
put the grow we have a good

3264
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:38,479
understanding of what equipment we need

3265
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:40,189
for the grow we've learned how to set up

3266
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,229
our lighting we've learned how to set up

3267
01:59:40,189 --> 01:59:44,719
our air conditioning we understand what

3268
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:46,129
type of humidifier and dehumidifier we

3269
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:48,409
might need we've got a good

3270
01:59:46,130 --> 01:59:50,779
understanding of how to set up our co2 I

3271
01:59:48,409 --> 01:59:53,539
think we are off to a really good start

3272
01:59:50,779 --> 01:59:56,029
in the next episode I plan to talk about

3273
01:59:53,539 --> 01:59:58,550
selecting the appropriate pots soil and

3274
01:59:56,029 --> 02:00:01,250
nutrients for your grow and after that

3275
01:59:58,550 --> 02:00:03,529
we'll work our way into integrated pest

3276
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:04,880
management before I start wrapping up

3277
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,679

3307
02:01:07,389 --> 02:01:12,130
I am dabbing I just took a big fat dab

3308
02:01:09,578 --> 02:01:14,469
of some coffee nectar from our friends

3309
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:17,109
at Green Dot labs this is alien cush and

3310
02:01:14,469 --> 02:01:19,599
alien og it's described as dark roast

3311
02:01:17,109 --> 02:01:21,098
coffee and watermelon candy I've talked

3312
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:23,078
about this one on the show before it

3313
02:01:21,099 --> 02:01:25,179
absolutely does have that coffee flavor

3314
02:01:23,078 --> 02:01:27,039
then the lingering aftertaste is a

3315
02:01:25,179 --> 02:01:28,569
little bit of coffee with that sweet

3316
02:01:27,039 --> 02:01:30,698
watermelon flavor that is an accurate

3317
02:01:28,569 --> 02:01:32,380
description there so big shout out to

3318
02:01:30,698 --> 02:01:35,799
our friends at green dot Labs and

3319
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:37,840
excellent work on the coffee nectar this

3320
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,670
episode is going to be another grow less

3321
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,590
and this will be the fifth lesson in a

3322
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:44,230
long series of grow lessons I've got

3323
02:01:41,590 --> 02:01:46,960
planned for you this lesson will be more

3324
02:01:44,229 --> 02:01:48,519
about selecting our equipment so at this

3325
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:50,559
point in the grow lessons we should have

3326
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:52,900
a good goal for our grow we should have

3327
02:01:50,559 --> 02:01:54,579
a good place for our grow planned out we

3328
02:01:52,899 --> 02:01:56,558
should have a good idea of the equipment

3329
02:01:54,578 --> 02:01:58,539
that we need and also you should have a

3330
02:01:56,559 --> 02:02:00,849
good idea of how to set up all of that

3331
02:01:58,539 --> 02:02:03,760
gear now that we've got a good grow room

3332
02:02:00,849 --> 02:02:05,590
running let's talk about pots and soil

3333
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:08,020
and then we'll work our way into our

3334
02:02:05,590 --> 02:02:09,639
nutrient options when it comes to

3335
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:12,280
selecting containers for our plants

3336
02:02:09,639 --> 02:02:15,130
we've got a lot of options we can select

3337
02:02:12,279 --> 02:02:17,859
net pot we can select plastic nursery

3338
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:20,020
pots we can use fabric pots also if

3339
02:02:17,859 --> 02:02:22,420
there are waffle pots also known as root

3340
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:24,849
pots available I've seen people get

3341
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:27,010
various sizes of bags of soil and cut

3342
02:02:24,849 --> 02:02:29,078
the top off a bag of soil you compact

3343
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:30,880
that soil down into the bag really tight

3344
02:02:29,078 --> 02:02:33,308
and you can grow your plant directly in

3345
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,170
there if that's what you want to do all

3346
02:02:33,309 --> 02:02:38,050
of these methods have their pros and

3347
02:02:35,170 --> 02:02:40,840
cons the main thing to focus on when

3348
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:44,380
selecting your pots is drainage your

3349
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:45,760
pots need holes on the bottom we're

3350
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:47,800
going to be watering and feeding our

3351
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,719
plants a lot of water if there's nowhere

3352
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,099
for that excess water to go it's just

3353
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:53,170
gonna build up in your pot you're gonna

3354
02:02:51,099 --> 02:02:55,389
create a mud puddle your plant will

3355
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:58,140
drown the roots will drown in there your

3356
02:02:55,389 --> 02:03:00,000
plant will die we need plenty of hole

3357
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:02,579
for drainage in the bottom of our pot no

3358
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,500
matter what type of pot we select the

3359
02:03:02,579 --> 02:03:06,930
net pots I talked about those are mostly

3360
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:09,420
holes your nursery pots they should come

3361
02:03:06,930 --> 02:03:11,610
with holes already in them the fabric

3362
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:13,680
pots they provide plenty of drainage by

3363
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:15,089
being a fabric pot the waffle pot does

3364
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:16,980
the same thing and you guys won't have

3365
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:18,989
seen a waffle pot I mean those air pots

3366
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:20,849
it looks like a waffle maker with a

3367
02:03:18,989 --> 02:03:22,859
bunch of holes in it and sometimes it's

3368
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:25,020
got rivets that you can undo and you can

3369
02:03:22,859 --> 02:03:27,179
unroll the pot and take the root ball

3370
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:29,520
out and you can manipulate the root ball

3371
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:31,140
and then put the pot back on or you can

3372
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:32,610
up pot it at that time but that's what I

3373
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:35,190
mean what I'm saying the waffle pots

3374
02:03:32,609 --> 02:03:37,139
their air pots they looks like somebody

3375
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:38,909
rolled them out with a waffle maker and

3376
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:40,230
they made a pot out of it you'll see

3377
02:03:38,909 --> 02:03:41,519
those when you go to the gross door and

3378
02:03:40,229 --> 02:03:43,649
you go shopping for pots you'll know

3379
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,510
what I'm talking about you can use

3380
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:47,729
whatever container you've got available

3381
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:49,800
to you a lot of people like to go buy a

3382
02:03:47,729 --> 02:03:51,539
bunch of five-gallon buckets a lot of

3383
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:53,489
people like to recycle some sort of

3384
02:03:51,539 --> 02:03:55,949
container that they use frequently that

3385
02:03:53,489 --> 02:03:58,710
is fine as long as you make some

3386
02:03:55,949 --> 02:04:00,809
drainage holes quite often I start my

3387
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:03,569
baby plants whether seeds or clones in

3388
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:05,670
beer cups when football season starts or

3389
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:08,519
during the Super Bowl those beer cups go

3390
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:10,890
on sale super cheap stock up get

3391
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:12,630
yourself a few bags of beer cups then I

3392
02:04:10,890 --> 02:04:14,670
stack them up about eight or ten tall

3393
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:16,470
and I use a drill and I take a power

3394
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:17,909
drill with the long bit and I poke a

3395
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:20,449
hole right through the bottom of the

3396
02:04:17,909 --> 02:04:22,829
center of eight to ten cups at a time I

3397
02:04:20,449 --> 02:04:24,689
just did 20 cups and they've got holes

3398
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:26,519
in them they've got one big drainage

3399
02:04:24,689 --> 02:04:28,079
hole they'll also go through and make

3400
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,730
one or two more holes on the side of

3401
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:31,680
each cup after that so I've got three

3402
02:04:29,729 --> 02:04:33,299
solid drainage holes and a beer cup that

3403
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:34,860
has plenty of drainage you're not gonna

3404
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,480
get any root rot you're not gonna get

3405
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:39,089
stagnant water in the bottom there so

3406
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:41,039
that's a great way to segue what are we

3407
02:04:39,090 --> 02:04:43,980
going to segue into let's work our way

3408
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:45,840
into pot sides we've got plenty of

3409
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:48,569
drainage now we need a pot that is the

3410
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,670
appropriate size for our plant I talked

3411
02:04:48,569 --> 02:04:53,099
about beer cups I like to start small

3412
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:55,440
plants in small pots either a beer cup

3413
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:57,780
maybe a four maybe a six inch net pot

3414
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,669
the reason for that why do you want to

3415
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:02,159
put a little tiny plant with a little

3416
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:03,779
tiny root zone in a big pot let's say

3417
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:05,789
you put it in a three gallon pot you've

3418
02:05:03,779 --> 02:05:07,349
got all that extra space in there for

3419
02:05:05,789 --> 02:05:09,269
those roots to just swim around in

3420
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:11,280
that's extra space that you need to

3421
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:13,530
water that's going to require more water

3422
02:05:11,279 --> 02:05:14,939
which will require more nutrients also

3423
02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:16,409
you're going to have to spread the

3424
02:05:14,939 --> 02:05:18,599
plants out more if they're in larger

3425
02:05:16,409 --> 02:05:20,939
pots which means you may require more

3426
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:22,740
light by keeping them in smaller pots

3427
02:05:20,939 --> 02:05:24,269
it keeps the garden more efficient and

3428
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:26,760
keeps things more cost effective and

3429
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:28,650
it's easier to maintain so I start my

3430
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:30,869
babies off in a little tiny pot and when

3431
02:05:28,649 --> 02:05:33,420
it's time I transplant them into a one

3432
02:05:30,869 --> 02:05:35,640
or three gallon pot sometimes I'll

3433
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:37,920
finish my plants in that one or three

3434
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:39,570
gallon pot other times I will either

3435
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:42,539
skip the three gallon and go straight

3436
02:05:39,569 --> 02:05:45,090
into a seven gallon pot or I'll go from

3437
02:05:42,539 --> 02:05:47,430
the cup into a three gallon into a seven

3438
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:49,650
gallon pot now let's talk about deciding

3439
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:52,590
which size pot to use how do I know

3440
02:05:49,649 --> 02:05:54,809
which size pot to transplant into that

3441
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:57,180
all depends on how long that plant is

3442
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:59,370
going to live it all depends on how big

3443
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,289
that plant is going to be in the end of

3444
02:05:59,369 --> 02:06:04,380
its life cycle how long are you going to

3445
02:06:01,289 --> 02:06:06,180
veg how long are you going to flower the

3446
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:08,699
pot size will also play a huge factor

3447
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:10,710
into how frequently you need to water

3448
02:06:08,699 --> 02:06:12,420
your garden if you're running little one

3449
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:14,130
gallon pots and you've got semi large

3450
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:16,350
plants you're gonna have to water every

3451
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:17,970
day if you've got semi large plants but

3452
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:20,010
you're running seven or ten gallon pots

3453
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:22,140
you can go in dump a bunch of water in

3454
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:24,180
there you can leave those four to three

3455
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:26,100
sometimes four or five days depending on

3456
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:27,930
how far under your cycles you are so the

3457
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:30,090
pot size is going to make a huge

3458
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:31,890
difference on how frequently you water

3459
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:34,350
now let's talk about the size of the

3460
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:36,300
plant and the size of our container when

3461
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:39,210
growing vigorous cannabis plants I would

3462
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:42,840
suggest approximately a two to three

3463
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:44,189
gallon pot for every 12 inches of plant

3464
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,100
growth so if you've got a twelve inch

3465
02:06:44,189 --> 02:06:48,539
tall plant you want about a two or three

3466
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:50,460
gallon pot and I'm talking about your

3467
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:52,590
finished plant size so if your plants

3468
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,300
gonna finish about twelve maybe 18

3469
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:55,829
inches tall that's when you want a two

3470
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:58,050
or three gallon pot sometimes I'll get

3471
02:06:55,829 --> 02:06:59,789
them about 24 inches tall and that 3

3472
02:06:58,050 --> 02:07:02,010
gallon pot but that's really pushing it

3473
02:06:59,789 --> 02:07:03,899
then I'm watering every single day and

3474
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:05,970
they're thirsty at the start of every

3475
02:07:03,899 --> 02:07:09,149
day so if your plants are gonna finish

3476
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:11,730
around 12 18 maybe 24 inches at the

3477
02:07:09,149 --> 02:07:13,769
maximum height then you can go any 2 to

3478
02:07:11,729 --> 02:07:16,139
3 gallon pot if you want to grow bigger

3479
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:18,060
plants you need bigger pots if you want

3480
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:19,490
to go to like a two foot tall plant

3481
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:22,620
that's when I would definitely recommend

3482
02:07:19,489 --> 02:07:24,149
three to five gallon pots I like a 5

3483
02:07:22,619 --> 02:07:25,260
gallon pot a 5 gallon pot is very

3484
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:26,759
versatile

3485
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:29,099
now if we want bigger plants we

3486
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:31,860
obviously need to move into bigger pots

3487
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:33,480
if you want about a 36 inch to a 42 inch

3488
02:07:31,859 --> 02:07:35,250
plant maybe just a little bit bigger

3489
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:37,288
that's when you need to work with the

3490
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:39,029
five to seven gallon pots now once you

3491
02:07:37,288 --> 02:07:40,828
start going past five feet in an indoor

3492
02:07:39,029 --> 02:07:42,210
grill it starts kind of becoming a pain

3493
02:07:40,828 --> 02:07:44,368
in the ass unless you're in a commercial

3494
02:07:42,210 --> 02:07:46,198
grow with kavita's up on the ceiling

3495
02:07:44,368 --> 02:07:48,210
you've got all that ceiling height but a

3496
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:49,738
five or six foot tall plant is really as

3497
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:51,420
tall as I would recommend in an indoor

3498
02:07:49,738 --> 02:07:53,279
grow unless you're really pushing it if

3499
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:54,989
you're gonna push out a big six-foot

3500
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:56,639
monster in the garage or something

3501
02:07:54,988 --> 02:07:59,129
that's when you want to push into a ten

3502
02:07:56,639 --> 02:08:01,139
maybe a 12 gallon pot we just need to be

3503
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:02,909
sure to have enough root space to

3504
02:08:01,139 --> 02:08:05,130
support these giant plants we're trying

3505
02:08:02,908 --> 02:08:07,500
to grow so try to select the appropriate

3506
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:09,538
container for the appropriate plant size

3507
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:11,340
are going to work with also keep in mind

3508
02:08:09,538 --> 02:08:14,099
that you can start small and you can

3509
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:15,989
always pot that plant I don't recommend

3510
02:08:14,099 --> 02:08:17,760
up potting during flower if it's

3511
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:20,038
critical you can do that I would like to

3512
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,650
see you transplant probably 10 days

3513
02:08:20,038 --> 02:08:24,840
maybe 710 days maybe five days before

3514
02:08:22,649 --> 02:08:26,308
you put it in the flower but you can if

3515
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:28,170
you're good at it you're not gonna shock

3516
02:08:26,309 --> 02:08:30,179
the plant at all you can transplant it

3517
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:31,590
the day you flip into flower and you can

3518
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:32,880
put it in the flower that day as long as

3519
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:34,440
you don't disrupt anything as long as

3520
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,719
you don't piss that plant off you will

3521
02:08:34,439 --> 02:08:37,919
be okay if you've given it any shock if

3522
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,868
you're not experienced with

3523
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:41,880
transplanting I would certainly give it

3524
02:08:39,868 --> 02:08:43,439
a few days to recover that way it's not

3525
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,788
getting transplanted and triggered in

3526
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:47,098
the flower and trying to figure life out

3527
02:08:44,788 --> 02:08:49,439
all at the same time give that plant a

3528
02:08:47,099 --> 02:08:51,659
chance so we've talked about drainage we

3529
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:53,399
have talked about the height and size of

3530
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:56,069
a plant in a pot now let's talk about

3531
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:59,729
the pros and the cons of small pots

3532
02:08:56,069 --> 02:09:02,130
versus large pots small pots let's talk

3533
02:08:59,729 --> 02:09:04,259
about the advantage of using small

3534
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:06,420
containers in our garden with a smaller

3535
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:07,920
container you don't need as much water

3536
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:10,889
which means you don't need as much

3537
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,170
nutrient the downside to that is you may

3538
02:09:10,889 --> 02:09:15,090
need to water more frequently once the

3539
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:17,099
plants get a little larger you may be in

3540
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:19,369
there watering twice a day if your pots

3541
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:22,590
are too small for your plant sides

3542
02:09:19,368 --> 02:09:24,389
another advantage of small pots is that

3543
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:26,788
you can fit the plants closer together

3544
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:28,920
they don't take up as much space the

3545
02:09:26,788 --> 02:09:30,719
downfall to that is you don't have as

3546
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:33,000
much space for branching if you're

3547
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:34,349
running a strain it just does one stick

3548
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,448
straight up and doesn't have a lot of

3549
02:09:34,349 --> 02:09:38,199
side branching maybe smaller pots are

3550
02:09:36,448 --> 02:09:40,509
ideal because you can get them closer

3551
02:09:38,199 --> 02:09:43,420
together another advantage to smaller

3552
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:45,159
pots are mobility some people aren't

3553
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:47,319
able-bodied some people need some

3554
02:09:45,159 --> 02:09:49,630
assistance and large pots may not be

3555
02:09:47,319 --> 02:09:51,789
ideal for them these small pots may be

3556
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:54,069
the way to go for people who aren't

3557
02:09:51,789 --> 02:09:56,680
physically able to manage a five or

3558
02:09:54,069 --> 02:09:58,449
seven gallon pot once these plants once

3559
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:59,770
these pots are filled with medium if

3560
02:09:58,449 --> 02:10:01,539
we're gonna put cocoa if we're gonna put

3561
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:03,310
soil we're gonna put a soilless mix

3562
02:10:01,539 --> 02:10:05,680
whatever we put in there then you add a

3563
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:07,360
plant in there then you add a gallon of

3564
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,530
water to a five-gallon pot that's got

3565
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:10,539
quite a bit of weight to it if you're

3566
02:10:08,529 --> 02:10:12,460
not an able-bodied person or if you've

3567
02:10:10,539 --> 02:10:14,649
got anything slowing you down that pot

3568
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:17,529
may not move it may be stuck right there

3569
02:10:14,649 --> 02:10:20,439
so one of the advantages of smaller pots

3570
02:10:17,529 --> 02:10:22,449
is mobility now let's talk about larger

3571
02:10:20,439 --> 02:10:24,639
pots as we work our way into larger pots

3572
02:10:22,449 --> 02:10:27,550
we do have different advantages and

3573
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:30,610
disadvantages one advantage of larger

3574
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:33,190
pots is less frequent watering the

3575
02:10:30,609 --> 02:10:35,259
disadvantage to that is it takes more to

3576
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:37,479
water at one time let's say we've got a

3577
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:39,670
seven gallon pot and the plants in about

3578
02:10:37,479 --> 02:10:41,529
week three a flower and we've given that

3579
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:43,149
plant a chance to dry out a little bit

3580
02:10:41,529 --> 02:10:45,759
and it's actually thirsty and it's prime

3581
02:10:43,149 --> 02:10:48,000
time for water that plant may take at

3582
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:51,190
least a gallon maybe a gallon and a half

3583
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,079
possibly two full gallons of water so

3584
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:55,539
it's gonna take a lot more water to

3585
02:10:53,079 --> 02:10:57,850
water that larger pot but we're not

3586
02:10:55,539 --> 02:11:00,970
going to need to water it for probably

3587
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:03,010
three days now my favorite advantage to

3588
02:11:00,970 --> 02:11:05,619
running large seven gallon pots is

3589
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:08,110
bigger plants in a bigger pot you can

3590
02:11:05,619 --> 02:11:09,760
get a bigger plant there are a lot of

3591
02:11:08,109 --> 02:11:11,829
things to consider when thinking about

3592
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:14,380
pot size the main thing to think about

3593
02:11:11,829 --> 02:11:16,479
is how big will your plant be in the end

3594
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:18,550
you need a big enough home for your

3595
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:19,959
plant at its finished size that's

3596
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:22,869
something to help you kind of think

3597
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:24,939
about pot size is plant count in

3598
02:11:22,869 --> 02:11:27,279
Colorado we are strictly limited by the

3599
02:11:24,939 --> 02:11:29,710
amount of plants we grow it doesn't

3600
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:32,439
matter how big those plants are but the

3601
02:11:29,710 --> 02:11:34,359
number is what they go by so somewhere

3602
02:11:32,439 --> 02:11:36,609
like Colorado with a limited plant count

3603
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:38,529
that's where we start growing gigantic

3604
02:11:36,609 --> 02:11:40,599
plants instead of having a whole bunch

3605
02:11:38,529 --> 02:11:42,909
of little plants under one light we just

3606
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:44,920
put one plant under a light and veg it

3607
02:11:42,909 --> 02:11:46,869
for a long time and then flower that out

3608
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:49,390
and we try to get one to two pounds out

3609
02:11:46,869 --> 02:11:51,579
of one plant under one light so plant

3610
02:11:49,390 --> 02:11:53,980
count is a huge factor of the

3611
02:11:51,579 --> 02:11:55,720
in mind when thinking about pot size now

3612
02:11:53,979 --> 02:11:58,329
if you don't have a plant count your

3613
02:11:55,720 --> 02:12:01,240
options are limitless you can run little

3614
02:11:58,329 --> 02:12:04,210
4 inch by 4 inch rock wool cubes you can

3615
02:12:01,239 --> 02:12:06,250
put 64 of those on a 4 by 4 tray and you

3616
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:08,649
can absolutely pull easily a pound

3617
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:11,199
underneath one light with 64 little

3618
02:12:08,649 --> 02:12:13,269
plants and very little bench time or if

3619
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:14,889
you want bigger plants you can do 9 3

3620
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:17,110
gallon pots under a thousand watt light

3621
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:18,910
or if you want to go bigger that's when

3622
02:12:17,109 --> 02:12:20,739
I would start recommending like 4 7

3623
02:12:18,909 --> 02:12:22,720
gallon pots under a thousand or if you

3624
02:12:20,739 --> 02:12:25,539
want to go even bigger maybe do one or

3625
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:27,550
two 10 gallons or maybe just one 12

3626
02:12:25,539 --> 02:12:29,829
gallon pot underneath a thousand watt

3627
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:32,350
light those are some of the pros and

3628
02:12:29,829 --> 02:12:34,750
cons or the advantages and disadvantages

3629
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:36,430
of larger and smaller pots I talked

3630
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:38,050
about different types of pots let's go

3631
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:41,230
over some of the types of pots that are

3632
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:43,539
available I talked about net pots net

3633
02:12:41,229 --> 02:12:45,099
pots are usually available in 4 or 6

3634
02:12:43,539 --> 02:12:46,989
inch diameters they aren't very deep

3635
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:49,150
they're only about 3 or 4 inches deep

3636
02:12:46,989 --> 02:12:51,699
they look like somebody took a pot and

3637
02:12:49,149 --> 02:12:53,710
then just cut a bunch of holes out of it

3638
02:12:51,699 --> 02:12:56,079
to make it more like a mesh more like a

3639
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:58,390
spaghetti strainer that is a net pot the

3640
02:12:56,079 --> 02:13:00,550
advantage to that is that it gets a lot

3641
02:12:58,390 --> 02:13:02,590
of air flow so you don't ever over water

3642
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:05,140
the plants and you get plenty of wet and

3643
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:07,750
dry cycling and you get a lot of oxygen

3644
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:09,820
to your root zone the downfall with the

3645
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:11,409
net pots is being so small and allowing

3646
02:13:09,819 --> 02:13:13,779
all that airflow they do require

3647
02:13:11,409 --> 02:13:16,420
frequent watering once the plants start

3648
02:13:13,779 --> 02:13:18,429
building a good root system in there the

3649
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:20,590
next pots I talked about were our basic

3650
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:22,690
nursery pots they're the plastic pots we

3651
02:13:20,590 --> 02:13:24,460
are all familiar with they come in a lot

3652
02:13:22,689 --> 02:13:26,319
of different sizes they're usually round

3653
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:28,420
some of them are square they are

3654
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:30,699
available in black or white if you're

3655
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:32,380
growing outdoors I may recommend a white

3656
02:13:30,699 --> 02:13:34,449
pot if it's available in the size you're

3657
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:36,970
looking for indoors I don't think it

3658
02:13:34,449 --> 02:13:38,439
makes a difference those pots are great

3659
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:40,690
there's a reason why they are the

3660
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:42,579
industry standard they come in any size

3661
02:13:40,689 --> 02:13:45,159
and volume you need and they are also

3662
02:13:42,579 --> 02:13:47,979
very affordable so those are your basic

3663
02:13:45,159 --> 02:13:50,139
nursery pots the advantage to those is

3664
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:52,299
they don't dry out as quickly as a root

3665
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:54,670
pot or an air pot so you'll have more

3666
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:57,550
time between waterings the disadvantage

3667
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:59,529
is less root growth and slower root

3668
02:13:57,550 --> 02:14:02,050
growth because that restricted air flow

3669
02:13:59,529 --> 02:14:02,739
more air flow allows more root growth

3670
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:04,810
and also

3671
02:14:02,739 --> 02:14:06,519
allows the plants to dry more quickly so

3672
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:09,160
there's a balance there between plastic

3673
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:12,010
pots and fabric pots that's a great way

3674
02:14:09,159 --> 02:14:14,260
to segue into fabric pots fabric pots

3675
02:14:12,010 --> 02:14:16,090
are available in many sizes I've seen

3676
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:18,100
them as small as a half gallon and I've

3677
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:20,560
seen them as big as 200 gallons and

3678
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:23,530
everything in between let's talk about

3679
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:26,500
the advantages of the fabric pots there

3680
02:14:23,529 --> 02:14:28,539
is a lot of air flow to your root zone I

3681
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:31,600
talked about it earlier the roots love

3682
02:14:28,539 --> 02:14:34,210
air flow this also helps us prevent

3683
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:36,160
over-watering even if you do over water

3684
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:37,810
that pots not going to hold it because

3685
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:39,880
it is fabric that water will just run

3686
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:42,070
right off so that's really advantageous

3687
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:44,890
with the large pot something I should

3688
02:14:42,069 --> 02:14:46,989
mention here's the disadvantage your air

3689
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:49,450
pots your fabric pots are going to dry

3690
02:14:46,989 --> 02:14:51,069
out much more quickly than a plastic pot

3691
02:14:49,449 --> 02:14:53,349
because of all that air flow

3692
02:14:51,069 --> 02:14:55,449
I would suggest buying a little larger

3693
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:57,850
pot if you're going to run fabric pots

3694
02:14:55,449 --> 02:15:01,269
if you want to run 5 gallon plastic pots

3695
02:14:57,850 --> 02:15:02,800
consider 7 gallon fabric pots for that

3696
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:04,840
extra time so that you don't have to

3697
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:06,670
water and your roots are just gonna grow

3698
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:08,739
more quickly with those air pots so I

3699
02:15:06,670 --> 02:15:11,260
would recommend that extra space just to

3700
02:15:08,739 --> 02:15:13,899
be safe so the advantage to fabric pots

3701
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:15,699
is faster growing more productive roots

3702
02:15:13,899 --> 02:15:18,129
the disadvantage is you're going to have

3703
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:20,199
to water more frequently now let's talk

3704
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:22,239
about those air pots or the waffle pots

3705
02:15:20,199 --> 02:15:24,340
I talked about what are those things all

3706
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:26,170
about those are great for the same

3707
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:28,500
reason as the fabric pots because your

3708
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:31,329
roots get oxygen from all directions

3709
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:33,880
another great thing about them is they

3710
02:15:31,329 --> 02:15:36,010
have got rivets on them when it's time

3711
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:38,170
to up pot your pot you don't have to

3712
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:40,900
lift that root ball up out of that pot

3713
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:43,090
you can undo the rivets and that pot

3714
02:15:40,899 --> 02:15:44,920
unwraps off of your root ball then you

3715
02:15:43,090 --> 02:15:47,890
can gently pick that root ball up and

3716
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:49,840
set it into your pot container and once

3717
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:51,789
your plant is potted all you have to do

3718
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:54,100
is pop the rivets back in and you can

3719
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:55,420
reuse that pot so it is reusable you

3720
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:56,860
didn't have to destroy it to get the

3721
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:58,329
plant out of there and the plant didn't

3722
02:15:56,859 --> 02:16:00,359
have to get destroyed to get out of

3723
02:15:58,329 --> 02:16:03,609
there so that's the advantage to those

3724
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:06,639
the disadvantage is the same as the

3725
02:16:03,609 --> 02:16:09,250
fabric pots they require more frequent

3726
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:10,960
watering so that's a basic breakdown of

3727
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:12,520
the three most common types of pots

3728
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,159
you're going to run into when shopping

3729
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:16,060
for pots for your new grow no matter

3730
02:16:15,159 --> 02:16:17,920
what type of

3731
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:20,260
you select you're going to need

3732
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:21,909
something under that to collect the

3733
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:24,250
runoff water keep in mind you'll need

3734
02:16:21,909 --> 02:16:26,199
some sort of saucer or a tray underneath

3735
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:28,449
your pot or maybe you're gonna put all

3736
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:30,189
of your pots on a table just think about

3737
02:16:28,449 --> 02:16:31,689
when you water that's all gonna run off

3738
02:16:30,189 --> 02:16:34,029
you need to collect that water somehow

3739
02:16:31,689 --> 02:16:35,799
it's got to go somewhere even if you're

3740
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:37,750
running it all off into a table it's all

3741
02:16:35,799 --> 02:16:39,309
got to get to a drain somehow if you're

3742
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:41,049
just running it into saucers you may

3743
02:16:39,309 --> 02:16:42,638
need to get a shop vac and suck that

3744
02:16:41,049 --> 02:16:45,099
water out of there don't leave those

3745
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:47,589
plants sitting in stagnant water for too

3746
02:16:45,099 --> 02:16:50,079
long all right that basically covers the

3747
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:52,599
pots and the part that goes on the floor

3748
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:54,190
I've been talking for about 16 minutes I

3749
02:16:52,599 --> 02:16:55,420
throw it's getting a little dry my

3750
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:57,040
head's getting a little clearer I'm

3751
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:58,960
gonna press pause I'm gonna take a

3752
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:01,179
couple of dabs I'm gonna get a drink and

3753
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:04,119
then when we get back we will talk about

3754
02:17:01,179 --> 02:17:06,250
selecting our medium for our new grow

3755
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:08,170
while I'm taking a couple of dabs I'm

3756
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:11,440
going to drop in a quick promotion for

cannabis you can grow so you can provide

3762
02:17:19,299 --> 02:17:24,218
that for yourself and people that rely

3763
02:17:21,159 --> 02:17:26,739
on you there are a few costs involved in

3764
02:17:24,218 --> 02:17:28,209
producing and hosting a podcast if you

3765
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:30,670
would like to help offset those costs

world I am back got all my problem

solved and I'm ready to continue with

3778
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:03,520
this show let's talk about the medium we

3779
02:18:01,718 --> 02:18:05,949
are going to select for our new grow

3780
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:07,750
medium that is what's going to go inside

3781
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:10,000
of our pot that is what our plant is

3782
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:12,520
going to grow out of are you going to

3783
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,649
choose soil a soilless mix are you going

3784
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:16,540
to grow in cocoa are you gonna cook up a

3785
02:18:14,649 --> 02:18:18,069
batch of super soil maybe you want some

3786
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:21,010
living soil maybe you want to do with

3787
02:18:18,069 --> 02:18:23,619
TLO or a no-till sort of system or maybe

3788
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:25,120
you're just going to grow in rock wool

3789
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:26,800
cubes and I know I don't have a lot of

3790
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:28,749
information in this episode for our

3791
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:31,328
hydro friends but I will put together

3792
02:18:28,748 --> 02:18:34,779
an entire hydro segment in the future

3793
02:18:31,328 --> 02:18:37,629
for our waterborne friends but for now

3794
02:18:34,779 --> 02:18:39,578
let's talk about soil and soilless mixes

3795
02:18:37,629 --> 02:18:41,738
a lot of people will tell you that they

3796
02:18:39,578 --> 02:18:44,498
are growing in soil when actually they

3797
02:18:41,738 --> 02:18:46,868
are drawing in a soilless mix let's talk

3798
02:18:44,498 --> 02:18:50,289
about the main differences between soil

3799
02:18:46,869 --> 02:18:53,309
and a soilless mix a soilless mix is

3800
02:18:50,289 --> 02:18:56,409
right between a soil and a hydro grow

3801
02:18:53,308 --> 02:18:59,038
soilless mix looks just like soil or

3802
02:18:56,408 --> 02:19:02,738
dirt the difference is there are no

3803
02:18:59,039 --> 02:19:05,769
nutrients in a soilless mix soilless

3804
02:19:02,738 --> 02:19:08,318
mixes are basically peat or cocoa based

3805
02:19:05,769 --> 02:19:10,689
most of your soilless mixes will have

3806
02:19:08,318 --> 02:19:14,019
plenty of aeration added to them like

3807
02:19:10,689 --> 02:19:15,578
perlite or volcanic rock soilless mixes

3808
02:19:14,019 --> 02:19:17,349
are great because they give us complete

3809
02:19:15,578 --> 02:19:19,898
control over what we are feeding our

3810
02:19:17,349 --> 02:19:21,969
plants now that leads us right into soil

3811
02:19:19,898 --> 02:19:24,478
the main difference between a soilless

3812
02:19:21,968 --> 02:19:27,788
blend and soil is the soil will have

3813
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,558
nutrients most of our store-bought soil

3814
02:19:27,789 --> 02:19:31,840
mixes will have the same things as a

3815
02:19:29,558 --> 02:19:34,028
soilless mix it will have the perlite it

3816
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:36,219
will have the peat moss in there but it

3817
02:19:34,029 --> 02:19:39,309
will also contain organically decomposed

3818
02:19:36,218 --> 02:19:42,188
matter that make the soil rich in micro

3819
02:19:39,308 --> 02:19:43,748
and macro nutrients now the advantage to

3820
02:19:42,189 --> 02:19:45,998
that is that you don't need to feed your

3821
02:19:43,748 --> 02:19:48,549
plants as heavily if at all the

3822
02:19:45,998 --> 02:19:50,078
disadvantage is you don't need to feed

3823
02:19:48,549 --> 02:19:52,208
your plants so you don't have control

3824
02:19:50,078 --> 02:19:54,549
over what you're feeding your plants are

3825
02:19:52,209 --> 02:19:57,220
already nutrients in that medium and you

3826
02:19:54,549 --> 02:19:59,920
may not know exactly what's there also

3827
02:19:57,219 --> 02:20:01,748
eventually those nutrients will be eaten

3828
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:04,029
up and you will need to either re amend

3829
02:20:01,748 --> 02:20:05,978
that soil or start using bottled

3830
02:20:04,029 --> 02:20:08,649
nutrients so that's the main difference

3831
02:20:05,978 --> 02:20:10,898
between soil and a soilless mix most of

3832
02:20:08,648 --> 02:20:13,629
us are going to go with a soilless mix

3833
02:20:10,898 --> 02:20:16,208
most of the soil and soilless mix is

3834
02:20:13,629 --> 02:20:18,549
available at your local grocer tabble

3835
02:20:16,209 --> 02:20:20,439
for you to grow in I really try not to

3836
02:20:18,549 --> 02:20:21,908
recommend specific products and specific

3837
02:20:20,439 --> 02:20:25,148
brands but I want to make this easy for

3838
02:20:21,908 --> 02:20:26,978
everybody Fox farms ocean forest soil is

3839
02:20:25,148 --> 02:20:28,689
available everywhere and it will work

3840
02:20:26,978 --> 02:20:30,010
for you some people are gonna hate me

3841
02:20:28,689 --> 02:20:32,619
for that some people are gonna love me

3842
02:20:30,010 --> 02:20:34,840
for that it works it is fine if that's

3843
02:20:32,619 --> 02:20:36,578
what's available to you get that it will

3844
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:38,680
do a good job also

3845
02:20:36,578 --> 02:20:40,538
roots organics makes a quality soil

3846
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:42,659
again I'm gonna get lovers and haters

3847
02:20:40,539 --> 02:20:45,090
for that I'm trying to make this easy

3848
02:20:42,659 --> 02:20:46,979
for new growers if you want a big bale

3849
02:20:45,090 --> 02:20:49,500
of soil that's going to work very well

3850
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:51,810
for you sunshine makes number four is

3851
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:54,750
very cost-effective and it is a quality

3852
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:56,520
product for a new grower I really try to

3853
02:20:54,750 --> 02:20:58,620
stay away from specific products but

3854
02:20:56,521 --> 02:20:59,989
those will work for a new grower and I

3855
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:03,120
know they are available at most

3856
02:20:59,989 --> 02:21:06,119
reputable grow shops if you choose to

3857
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:09,329
grow in a soil eventually you may need

3858
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:12,090
to re amend that soil or start watering

3859
02:21:09,329 --> 02:21:14,310
with bottled nutrients if you go with

3860
02:21:12,090 --> 02:21:17,159
the soilless mix you do need to start

3861
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:18,209
feeding nutrients right away that's when

3862
02:21:17,159 --> 02:21:21,119
we'll need to start thinking about

3863
02:21:18,209 --> 02:21:23,669
organics or synthetics or boxes or

3864
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:27,750
bottles now that gives us a beautiful

3865
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:29,190
segue into pre-made soil mixes a lot of

3866
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:30,569
people don't want to use bottled

3867
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:32,130
nutrients they want to be more

3868
02:21:30,569 --> 02:21:34,890
sustainable and they want to be more

3869
02:21:32,129 --> 02:21:36,869
organic the best options to do that are

3870
02:21:34,890 --> 02:21:40,829
things like super soil or other living

3871
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:42,811
soils or TLO or a no-till setup when

3872
02:21:40,829 --> 02:21:44,430
you're using these pre-made soils you

3873
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:46,020
don't need to add bottled nutrients

3874
02:21:44,430 --> 02:21:47,729
because everything is already in the

3875
02:21:46,021 --> 02:21:50,101
medium available to the plant as the

3876
02:21:47,729 --> 02:21:52,199
plant needs it now let's talk briefly

3877
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:54,210
about what I mean by super soil or a

3878
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:55,829
living soil they're very similar some

3879
02:21:54,209 --> 02:21:57,359
people are gonna argue with me but we're

3880
02:21:55,829 --> 02:21:59,640
gonna put them in the same category for

3881
02:21:57,360 --> 02:22:02,610
the sake of this talk a super soil or a

3882
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:05,010
living soil is exactly that it is a soil

3883
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:07,170
that is alive it is filled with microbes

3884
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:09,329
and beneficial fungus and bacteria and

3885
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:10,739
all of the macro and micronutrients we

3886
02:22:09,329 --> 02:22:12,899
need to get our plant through the growth

3887
02:22:10,739 --> 02:22:15,149
cycle and a lot of times people add a

3888
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:17,459
few bonus items in there like some

3889
02:22:15,149 --> 02:22:20,100
volcanic rock dust or whatever your

3890
02:22:17,459 --> 02:22:20,640
secret ingredient may be but a super

3891
02:22:20,101 --> 02:22:22,110
soil

3892
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:23,760
you basically gather all of your

3893
02:22:22,110 --> 02:22:25,620
ingredients in the way I would do it I

3894
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:28,021
would throw a large tarp on the ground

3895
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:29,610
in the garage I would mix up all of the

3896
02:22:28,021 --> 02:22:31,980
ingredients together there's gonna be

3897
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:33,870
bags of a base mix which will probably

3898
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:35,939
be a soilless mix that you'll probably

3899
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:38,400
get from a gross store and then a lot of

3900
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:40,079
amendments depending on your style of

3901
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:41,969
growing and what you want to do the

3902
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:43,771
amendments will vary if you've heard

3903
02:22:41,969 --> 02:22:45,449
Sean and Jessi on the show before you

3904
02:22:43,771 --> 02:22:47,670
know we're probably going to put some

3905
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:49,920
alfalfa in there we'll probably put some

3906
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:51,989
karanji in there probably be some neem

3907
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:53,909
cakes in there it all just depends on

3908
02:22:51,989 --> 02:22:56,189
the style of your grow if you want to

3909
02:22:53,909 --> 02:22:57,959
use animal products you can put blood

3910
02:22:56,189 --> 02:23:00,359
miel bone meal and fish meal in there

3911
02:22:57,959 --> 02:23:02,340
you can always put oyster shell stuff in

3912
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:04,649
there you can put kelp meal in there all

3913
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:06,748
that type of stuff will go into a living

3914
02:23:04,648 --> 02:23:09,059
soil or a super soil then it will get

3915
02:23:06,748 --> 02:23:10,799
mixed up and put into a container then a

3916
02:23:09,059 --> 02:23:12,238
little water will be added that will

3917
02:23:10,799 --> 02:23:13,738
make everything come to life in there

3918
02:23:12,238 --> 02:23:15,689
you'll start seeing a little white

3919
02:23:13,738 --> 02:23:17,788
fungus on top of your soil that is a

3920
02:23:15,689 --> 02:23:20,248
good thing that is why we call it living

3921
02:23:17,789 --> 02:23:23,069
soil that's a living soil or a super

3922
02:23:20,248 --> 02:23:25,680
soil idea you can find plenty of recipes

3923
02:23:23,068 --> 02:23:28,469
online a few Google sub pools super soil

3924
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:30,840
recipe you will find it I promise you

3925
02:23:28,469 --> 02:23:32,368
can also go to build a soils website and

3926
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:34,529
I'm sure they will give you plenty of

3927
02:23:32,369 --> 02:23:37,050
information on building a living soil

3928
02:23:34,529 --> 02:23:40,229
now let me talk briefly about the pros

3929
02:23:37,049 --> 02:23:43,139
and cons of a living soil or a super

3930
02:23:40,228 --> 02:23:45,898
soil first it's a lot of ingredients to

3931
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:47,760
gather but they are affordable there are

3932
02:23:45,898 --> 02:23:49,828
probably more cost-effective than buying

3933
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:51,930
a bunch of bottles so you gather your

3934
02:23:49,828 --> 02:23:53,879
ingredients then you've got to mix them

3935
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:55,439
yourself which is kind of fun if you're

3936
02:23:53,879 --> 02:23:57,538
into that if you're not into that it's a

3937
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:59,369
giant pain in the ass I think it's fun

3938
02:23:57,539 --> 02:24:01,470
you lay out a giant tarp in the garage

3939
02:23:59,369 --> 02:24:03,180
you weigh out and measure out your stuff

3940
02:24:01,469 --> 02:24:05,278
you mix it up you put it in containers

3941
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:07,979
it's a good time so there's work to it

3942
02:24:05,279 --> 02:24:09,658
then it's got to cook it needs a

3943
02:24:07,978 --> 02:24:12,778
specified time depending on your

3944
02:24:09,658 --> 02:24:15,238
ingredients it needs about 30 maybe 45

3945
02:24:12,779 --> 02:24:17,939
days so it needs prep time that is the

3946
02:24:15,238 --> 02:24:19,498
downfall another downfall is a lot of

3947
02:24:17,939 --> 02:24:22,139
those organic amendments are not

3948
02:24:19,498 --> 02:24:24,539
completely reliable on their nitrogen

3949
02:24:22,139 --> 02:24:26,219
potassium and phosphorous levels we're

3950
02:24:24,539 --> 02:24:28,350
adding a bunch of things to a bunch of

3951
02:24:26,219 --> 02:24:30,179
other things and cooking it it may come

3952
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:32,309
out a little richer or a little lighter

3953
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:34,648
than we expected if you're not an

3954
02:24:32,309 --> 02:24:36,389
experienced grower a super soil may

3955
02:24:34,648 --> 02:24:38,818
throw your plants off and you will have

3956
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:41,038
no idea how to adjust and correct that

3957
02:24:38,818 --> 02:24:43,528
so that is one of the major downfalls to

3958
02:24:41,039 --> 02:24:45,270
a living soil for a new grower if you

3959
02:24:43,529 --> 02:24:47,130
mix everything properly and you know how

3960
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:49,140
to pay attention to the plants a living

3961
02:24:47,129 --> 02:24:51,719
soil and a super soil can do beautiful

3962
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:52,858
things for your garden now if you really

3963
02:24:51,719 --> 02:24:55,469
want to step your game up

3964
02:24:52,859 --> 02:24:57,449
you can go TLO which means true living

3965
02:24:55,469 --> 02:24:59,698
organics or you can go no-till they're

3966
02:24:57,449 --> 02:25:01,890
both very similar I honestly don't have

3967
02:24:59,699 --> 02:25:03,720
a lot of experience in either one that's

3968
02:25:01,889 --> 02:25:05,309
Sean and Jesse's Department they both

3969
02:25:03,719 --> 02:25:07,108
crush it with the TLO and with the

3970
02:25:05,309 --> 02:25:09,208
living organic stuff but that's when you

3971
02:25:07,109 --> 02:25:09,729
start involving worms into your grow

3972
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:12,250
that's why

3973
02:25:09,729 --> 02:25:14,079
so with the no-till garden were never

3974
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:16,210
taking anything to the trash we're

3975
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:18,250
basically harvesting a plant and then

3976
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:20,020
where the whole from that plant was we

3977
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:21,370
put another plant and then backfill it

3978
02:25:20,021 --> 02:25:23,500
with a little bit of compost that we've

3979
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:26,021
made ourselves it'll waste from the

3980
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:28,360
plant after we harvest it goes back into

3981
02:25:26,021 --> 02:25:30,221
our compost so we reuse almost

3982
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:32,381
everything in a no-till environment

3983
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:34,421
again with the TLO and a no-till

3984
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:37,270
environment it does take some time to

3985
02:25:34,421 --> 02:25:39,341
prepare and set up that soil one good

3986
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:41,261
thing about a no-till all of my notes

3987
02:25:39,341 --> 02:25:43,601
Hill friends tell me it gets better with

3988
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:45,729
every grow they bought everything for

3989
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:47,591
the no-till grow they set it up one time

3990
02:25:45,729 --> 02:25:49,750
and they got it going and they got it

3991
02:25:47,591 --> 02:25:51,761
dialed in and then grew a crop and those

3992
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:53,470
plants came out pretty well they pulled

3993
02:25:51,761 --> 02:25:54,310
out that root ball they put that in the

3994
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:55,539
compost bin

3995
02:25:54,310 --> 02:25:57,431
they put a fresh plant in there they

3996
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:59,080
added some compost they remanded they

3997
02:25:57,431 --> 02:26:01,000
put some cover crop on the plant or on

3998
02:25:59,079 --> 02:26:02,319
the pot and then it grew in there the

3999
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,479
whole plant grew again they said that

4000
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:06,130
second crop was better the last time

4001
02:26:04,479 --> 02:26:08,591
frosty was here I think he said he was

4002
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:09,970
on his seventh run with his no-till crop

4003
02:26:08,591 --> 02:26:12,310
and it is getting better every time

4004
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:15,011
imagine if every time you grew in the

4005
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:17,770
dirt it got better a normal soil or

4006
02:26:15,011 --> 02:26:19,329
soilless mix guy is either throwing that

4007
02:26:17,771 --> 02:26:21,551
away or trying to find some way to

4008
02:26:19,329 --> 02:26:24,399
recycle it and it's a struggle so the

4009
02:26:21,550 --> 02:26:26,591
advantage there of the no-till is you

4010
02:26:24,399 --> 02:26:28,479
were recycling all of your grow to go

4011
02:26:26,591 --> 02:26:31,239
back into your grow it is very

4012
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:34,239
sustainable and it is 100% organic if

4013
02:26:31,239 --> 02:26:36,699
you keep it that way the downfall is it

4014
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:38,530
takes a lot of time to set up and it's a

4015
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:40,811
hundred percent organic so if you have a

4016
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:43,150
problem you have to research a hundred

4017
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:45,579
percent organic methods to correct your

4018
02:26:43,149 --> 02:26:47,890
issues you can't go to the store buy a

4019
02:26:45,579 --> 02:26:49,421
bottle of something shake it up apply it

4020
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:51,761
to your plants and think you've solved

4021
02:26:49,421 --> 02:26:53,950
your problem it's not so easy in a

4022
02:26:51,761 --> 02:26:55,720
no-till environment it looks like it

4023
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:57,761
takes a little more thinking but it also

4024
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:59,261
looks like it is much more rewarding my

4025
02:26:57,761 --> 02:27:02,620
friends they grow the no-till weed it

4026
02:26:59,261 --> 02:27:05,470
really tastes really good so the pros of

4027
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:07,181
the no-till and the TLO grow is it's

4028
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:08,560
organic you know what you're putting in

4029
02:27:07,181 --> 02:27:11,921
there you know that you're gonna have a

4030
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:13,630
clean tasty product also it's being self

4031
02:27:11,921 --> 02:27:15,220
sustained you don't have to introduce a

4032
02:27:13,630 --> 02:27:16,449
bunch of funky [ __ ] you don't have to

4033
02:27:15,220 --> 02:27:19,511
keep buying products there are no

4034
02:27:16,450 --> 02:27:21,280
bottles to throw away the downside is it

4035
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:23,171
takes a little while to get your medium

4036
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,440
started before you can even put a plant

4037
02:27:23,171 --> 02:27:25,450
and

4038
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:27,971
there you guys I honestly don't have

4039
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:30,971
enough experience with the super soil a

4040
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:32,739
living soil at elo or a no-till grow to

4041
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:34,689
talk like I'm an expert I'm trying to

4042
02:27:32,739 --> 02:27:36,280
give you the best of my knowledge from

4043
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:38,230
what I understand I'm sure there is more

4044
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:40,271
to think about when it comes to those

4045
02:27:38,229 --> 02:27:42,430
types of grows those are more advanced

4046
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:44,409
techniques in my opinion now we've

4047
02:27:42,431 --> 02:27:46,301
talked about soil and soilless mixes

4048
02:27:44,409 --> 02:27:48,550
we've talked about living soils let's

4049
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:51,789
talk about the exact opposite let's talk

4050
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:54,671
about cocoa I really like growing in

4051
02:27:51,790 --> 02:27:56,021
cocoa I have a lot of experience growing

4052
02:27:54,671 --> 02:27:57,909
in cocoa if I were to set up a

4053
02:27:56,021 --> 02:27:59,500
commercial growth today and I had a

4054
02:27:57,909 --> 02:28:01,780
budget that I could do whatever I wanted

4055
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:05,171
with we would run a cocoa setup it would

4056
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:07,540
be cocoa with a lot of perlite I like

4057
02:28:05,171 --> 02:28:10,450
cocoa because cocoa doesn't hold on to

4058
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:12,490
any nutrients I also like cocoa because

4059
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:14,860
it is inert it does not contain any

4060
02:28:12,489 --> 02:28:16,869
nutrients when you buy it it is just

4061
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:19,301
clean medium that the plants can hang

4062
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:20,891
out in and the roots really seem to be

4063
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:22,600
comfortable in there so you get to

4064
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:24,431
control everything when it comes to

4065
02:28:22,601 --> 02:28:26,351
cocoa you get to control every nutrient

4066
02:28:24,431 --> 02:28:28,721
that goes in there and I really like the

4067
02:28:26,351 --> 02:28:30,851
wet and dry time with cocoa a well

4068
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:33,640
aerated cocoa wet and dry time is

4069
02:28:30,851 --> 02:28:35,710
beautiful and one thing about cocoa it

4070
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:38,319
kind of works like hydro so I'm able to

4071
02:28:35,709 --> 02:28:40,060
feed my cocoa grow twice a day I can

4072
02:28:38,319 --> 02:28:42,190
pump nutrients through that grow two

4073
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:44,829
times every day which means those plants

4074
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:46,931
are really eating heavily a couple of

4075
02:28:44,829 --> 02:28:49,060
tips if you choose cocoa make sure you

4076
02:28:46,931 --> 02:28:51,730
rinse your cocoa before you put your

4077
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:53,351
plants in it wash it off it is dirty I'm

4078
02:28:51,729 --> 02:28:55,180
not sure where you got your cocoa from

4079
02:28:53,351 --> 02:28:57,159
who knows where they got it from who

4080
02:28:55,181 --> 02:28:58,870
knows where it was stored just rinse it

4081
02:28:57,159 --> 02:29:00,039
if you can just fill a pot with it if

4082
02:28:58,870 --> 02:29:01,900
that's what you need to do put it in a

4083
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:03,131
giant pot and then just run a bunch of

4084
02:29:01,899 --> 02:29:05,229
water through it to where you're running

4085
02:29:03,130 --> 02:29:07,510
the water clean that would really be

4086
02:29:05,229 --> 02:29:10,091
beneficial for you also when you're

4087
02:29:07,511 --> 02:29:12,431
running cocoa you may need more Cal mag

4088
02:29:10,091 --> 02:29:14,560
than you're used to earlier I said

4089
02:29:12,431 --> 02:29:16,060
nothing stays in the cocoa that means

4090
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,979
that the cal mag just falls right out

4091
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:19,720
when you've got runoff water that cal

4092
02:29:17,979 --> 02:29:21,761
mag went right on out with that it's not

4093
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:23,350
hanging out in the median like it would

4094
02:29:21,761 --> 02:29:25,149
if you had soil there's nothing for it

4095
02:29:23,351 --> 02:29:27,310
to hang on to in the cocoa the cocoa

4096
02:29:25,149 --> 02:29:29,591
doesn't grab it like a soil or soilless

4097
02:29:27,310 --> 02:29:31,270
mix wood so a couple of basic tips if

4098
02:29:29,591 --> 02:29:33,370
you choose to go in cocoa would be make

4099
02:29:31,271 --> 02:29:34,841
sure you rinse it it may be salty you

4100
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:36,320
don't want to put your plants in that

4101
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:38,960
salty environment

4102
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:40,819
then increase your Cal mag and possibly

4103
02:29:38,959 --> 02:29:43,459
you may need to increase your overall

4104
02:29:40,819 --> 02:29:45,529
nutrient regimen I recommend feeding

4105
02:29:43,459 --> 02:29:47,659
every day when you're growing in cocoa

4106
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:49,370
if you're in soil or a soilless mix you

4107
02:29:47,659 --> 02:29:52,219
may be only feeding once a week or twice

4108
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:55,070
a week you can feed every single day in

4109
02:29:52,219 --> 02:29:57,020
cocoa every time you water those plants

4110
02:29:55,069 --> 02:29:59,270
put some nutrients in there if you're

4111
02:29:57,021 --> 02:30:00,980
growing in cocoa a lot of times in the

4112
02:29:59,271 --> 02:30:02,930
big grow we would give them a big

4113
02:30:00,979 --> 02:30:04,459
watering a big feeding to start the day

4114
02:30:02,930 --> 02:30:06,470
they would get base nutrients they would

4115
02:30:04,459 --> 02:30:08,419
get cal-mag they'll get a bloom booster

4116
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:09,529
they would get their whatever else we

4117
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:11,389
were feeding in that day we had a whole

4118
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:12,920
list of stuff we'd feed the plants so

4119
02:30:11,389 --> 02:30:14,689
we'd feed them that early in the morning

4120
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:16,729
then right before we leave a lot of

4121
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:19,190
times we would just shoot just a small

4122
02:30:16,729 --> 02:30:20,750
feed of just base nutrients in cal-mag

4123
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:21,980
through at the end of the day just to

4124
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:23,329
make sure the plants were wet by the

4125
02:30:21,979 --> 02:30:25,489
time we got there in the morning and

4126
02:30:23,329 --> 02:30:27,049
they really liked being fed twice a day

4127
02:30:25,489 --> 02:30:29,449
that first time we would feed them a big

4128
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:31,939
fat meal the second time just based

4129
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:33,920
newts and cal-mag so the benefits

4130
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:36,440
growing in cocoa is you get to control

4131
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,360
all of the nutrients in the middle I

4132
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:40,370
don't know if it's a pro or con it dries

4133
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:42,230
up more quickly than soil so you may

4134
02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:44,210
need to water more often I like that

4135
02:30:42,229 --> 02:30:46,639
because that means I get to feed more

4136
02:30:44,209 --> 02:30:49,399
frequently now the con to growing in

4137
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:51,859
cocoa it's not as forgiving as soil or a

4138
02:30:49,399 --> 02:30:54,109
soilless mix it's acting more like hydro

4139
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:55,579
so if you make a mistake you're going to

4140
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:57,920
see it immediately

4141
02:30:55,579 --> 02:31:00,049
there's no buffer to fix your mistakes

4142
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,149
so if you over feed in cocoa those

4143
02:31:00,049 --> 02:31:04,849
plants will show you right away now

4144
02:31:02,149 --> 02:31:06,770
let's move into the last medium that I

4145
02:31:04,850 --> 02:31:09,771
have on my list to talk about and that

4146
02:31:06,771 --> 02:31:11,480
is rock wool rock wool are those cubes

4147
02:31:09,771 --> 02:31:13,640
that you see at the growth store they

4148
02:31:11,479 --> 02:31:15,709
just look like a giant sponge they're

4149
02:31:13,639 --> 02:31:17,840
great for hydro they are great for a

4150
02:31:15,709 --> 02:31:20,059
commercial environment they are very

4151
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:23,000
cost effective they are very easy to

4152
02:31:20,059 --> 02:31:26,270
dispose of they work very much like

4153
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,420
cocoa they do not have any nutrients in

4154
02:31:26,271 --> 02:31:32,450
them they do not hold any nutrients they

4155
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:35,659
also have a very nice wet and dry time

4156
02:31:32,450 --> 02:31:37,640
they come in a very large variety of

4157
02:31:35,659 --> 02:31:39,799
sizes you can get them at a one by one

4158
02:31:37,639 --> 02:31:41,869
cube so you can cut your clone into a

4159
02:31:39,799 --> 02:31:45,349
little one by one then they also make

4160
02:31:41,870 --> 02:31:47,329
them in a 4x4 6x6 just about any size

4161
02:31:45,350 --> 02:31:49,239
you need and you can grow a huge plant

4162
02:31:47,329 --> 02:31:51,370
in a small Rockville

4163
02:31:49,239 --> 02:31:53,500
you can cut your clone into a one-inch

4164
02:31:51,370 --> 02:31:55,270
Rockwell cube and then the 4x4 has a

4165
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:57,040
little spot or that one inch will set

4166
02:31:55,270 --> 02:31:59,380
right into it and then the eighth inch

4167
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,520
has a little slot cut in two or that 4x4

4168
02:31:59,379 --> 02:32:02,170
fits right into it

4169
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:04,510
so you can just keep potting just by

4170
02:32:02,170 --> 02:32:06,579
setting it on top of another one that

4171
02:32:04,510 --> 02:32:09,010
really saves a lot of work any large

4172
02:32:06,579 --> 02:32:11,709
commercial grow and I probably shouldn't

4173
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:13,930
forget that they also offer cocoa in the

4174
02:32:11,709 --> 02:32:15,789
same types of slabs you put your clone

4175
02:32:13,930 --> 02:32:17,710
into a small little cocoa slab and it

4176
02:32:15,790 --> 02:32:19,270
fits right into a larger which fits into

4177
02:32:17,709 --> 02:32:22,000
a larger cocoa slab it kinda looks like

4178
02:32:19,270 --> 02:32:24,360
a volcano I should not forget about that

4179
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,889
those are great for hydro type

4180
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:28,450
applications alright you guys I feel

4181

described as dark roast coffee garlic

4212
02:33:37,569 --> 02:33:42,430
and fuel I would absolutely agree with

4213
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:44,350
that description but I may add a little

4214
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:46,300
bit of underarms and onions to that

4215

after smell to this that I know it

4217
02:33:48,610 --> 02:33:52,630

4218
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:54,010
inviting if I opened up this concentrate

4219

here and stare into the computer screen

4230
02:34:14,890 --> 02:34:18,370
for a couple of seconds before I started

4231

podcast so let's get right to it this is

4236
02:34:27,671 --> 02:34:33,220
going to be the 6th bro lesson in a long

4237
02:34:30,581 --> 02:34:34,751
series of lessons in this lesson we're

4238
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:37,060
gonna talk about selecting your

4239
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:39,101
nutrients if you're a new listener if

4240
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:41,529
you're a new grower I suggest you head

4241
02:34:39,101 --> 02:34:43,271
back to episode 351 and start listening

4242
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:45,251
there that will give you a solid

4243
02:34:43,271 --> 02:34:47,711
foundation on setting goals for your

4244
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:49,630
grow selecting your space and selecting

4245
02:34:47,710 --> 02:34:51,340
your equipment for the grow if you're an

4246
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:53,710
experienced grower or if you've been

4247
02:34:51,341 --> 02:34:57,371
listening let's get right into selecting

4248
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:59,439
nutrients for your new grow selecting

4249
02:34:57,370 --> 02:35:01,870
nutrients or fertilizers for your new

4250
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:04,990
garden can be very challenging it can

4251
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:06,540
also be very intimidating nutrients and

4252
02:35:04,990 --> 02:35:09,190
fertilizers are the most heavily

4253
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:11,649
advertised product in the gross store

4254
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:13,541
after you have the gross setup your

4255
02:35:11,649 --> 02:35:16,029
nutrients will probably be the most

4256
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:18,670
expensive recurring cost you have in

4257
02:35:16,030 --> 02:35:21,190
your grow I'm going to do my best to

4258
02:35:18,671 --> 02:35:23,411
guide you on selecting nutrients without

4259
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:25,271
recommending specific brands without

4260
02:35:23,411 --> 02:35:27,280
recommending specific products I'm

4261
02:35:25,271 --> 02:35:29,261
trying not to pitch anything here I'm

4262
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,240
not trying to steer you any specific

4263
02:35:29,261 --> 02:35:33,819
direction but I want to give you a good

4264
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:35,411
idea and a good understanding of what to

4265
02:35:33,819 --> 02:35:38,351
think about when you are trying to

4266
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:40,451
customize your garden for yourself there

4267
02:35:38,351 --> 02:35:42,851
are thousands of nutrient companies out

4268
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:45,670
there and countless ways to amend and

4269
02:35:42,851 --> 02:35:48,310
fertilize soil it may take a little bit

4270
02:35:45,671 --> 02:35:51,399
of trial and error to dial in what works

4271
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:53,529
best for you don't be afraid to run one

4272
02:35:51,399 --> 02:35:55,120
nutrient brand for your first grow and a

4273
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:57,251
completely different line for your

4274
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:58,750
second grow take notes when you do

4275
02:35:57,251 --> 02:36:00,851
things like that and then you can

4276
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:02,229
compare what you liked better maybe one

4277
02:36:00,851 --> 02:36:04,331
nutrient company will give you better

4278
02:36:02,229 --> 02:36:05,740
flavors one nutrient company is going to

4279
02:36:04,331 --> 02:36:07,899
give you better yields and one will

4280
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:09,610
probably give you better potency if you

4281
02:36:07,899 --> 02:36:11,470
can find the company that does all three

4282
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:14,291
of those and work with your growth style

4283
02:36:11,470 --> 02:36:14,909
that's what you want to do also the

4284
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:17,429
cannabis

4285
02:36:14,909 --> 02:36:19,469
Street is filled with egos don't let

4286
02:36:17,430 --> 02:36:21,180
anybody tell you you were choosing the

4287
02:36:19,469 --> 02:36:23,459
wrong line because it's not what they

4288
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:25,500
choose as long as you are satisfied with

4289
02:36:23,459 --> 02:36:26,969
the outcome and you are okay with the

4290
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:28,979
ethics of the company you are giving

4291
02:36:26,969 --> 02:36:31,469
your money to you can use whatever

4292
02:36:28,979 --> 02:36:34,529
nutrients you want that is the beauty of

4293
02:36:31,469 --> 02:36:36,270
building your own grow now let's talk

4294
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:39,540
about some of the options when it comes

4295
02:36:36,271 --> 02:36:41,340
to selecting nutrients for our grow when

4296
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:42,840
you go to the gross store the number one

4297
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:46,049
thing they're going to pitch to you is

4298
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:48,180
bottled nutrients growth stores love to

4299
02:36:46,049 --> 02:36:49,560
sell bottled nutrients there are

4300
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:52,021
different types of bottled nutrients

4301
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:54,539
available we've got salt based bottled

4302
02:36:52,021 --> 02:36:57,900
nutrients most of your big brand names

4303
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:59,880
are salt based there are also organic

4304
02:36:57,899 --> 02:37:01,469
bottled nutrients available a lot of

4305
02:36:59,879 --> 02:37:03,810
companies boast about having fully

4306
02:37:01,469 --> 02:37:07,109
organic lines that's always an option

4307
02:37:03,810 --> 02:37:09,390
also there are veganic options available

4308
02:37:07,110 --> 02:37:12,450
which means there are no animal products

4309
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:14,819
in an organic lineup and of course we

4310
02:37:12,450 --> 02:37:16,440
can always do a combination of organics

4311
02:37:14,819 --> 02:37:18,090
and synthetics there's always a nice

4312
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:19,920
balance to find there and make sure that

4313
02:37:18,090 --> 02:37:21,780
none of our synthetics all based

4314
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:24,780
nutrients are going to destroy anything

4315
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:26,579
in our organic nutrients but there is no

4316
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:29,280
problem using them together once you

4317
02:37:26,579 --> 02:37:31,351
understand that balance now let's talk

4318
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:34,110
about some of the pros and cons of

4319
02:37:31,351 --> 02:37:36,300
bottled nutrients a moment ago I said

4320
02:37:34,110 --> 02:37:37,829
you can choose whatever brand you like

4321
02:37:36,299 --> 02:37:40,159
as long as you are comfortable with

4322
02:37:37,829 --> 02:37:42,899
their ethics now what do I mean by that

4323
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:45,450
as a consumer it is our responsibility

4324
02:37:42,899 --> 02:37:47,369
to understand what the companies we

4325
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:49,409
support do with the money we give them

4326
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:51,480
if you don't agree with the way a

4327
02:37:49,409 --> 02:37:53,340
company operates if you don't agree with

4328
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:55,500
things that company supports you do not

4329
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:57,960
have to shop with that company you vote

4330
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:59,909
with your dollars try to spend your

4331
02:37:57,959 --> 02:38:02,219
money with a company who supports

4332
02:37:59,909 --> 02:38:04,829
cannabis try to keep your money on our

4333
02:38:02,219 --> 02:38:06,510
team try not to spend your money with

4334
02:38:04,829 --> 02:38:08,069
the company who is unethical but the

4335
02:38:06,510 --> 02:38:09,840
company who is slowly destroying the

4336
02:38:08,069 --> 02:38:12,180
world with the company who is slowly

4337
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,010
poisoning mankind so when it comes to

4338
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:16,050
selecting nutrients do a little bit of

4339
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:18,120
research about the company do research

4340
02:38:16,049 --> 02:38:20,489
about their parent company see who owns

4341
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:22,351
that company and find out who's at the

4342
02:38:20,489 --> 02:38:24,539
top of the food chain and see who you're

4343
02:38:22,351 --> 02:38:26,190
giving your money to I know I just added

4344
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:27,989
a whole new step to your selection

4345
02:38:26,190 --> 02:38:29,880
process but that is my response

4346
02:38:27,988 --> 02:38:31,799
is to make you guys think about stuff

4347
02:38:29,879 --> 02:38:33,420
like that so think about the ethics of

4348
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:35,159
the company you are spending your money

4349
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:37,049
with when you were selecting your

4350
02:38:35,159 --> 02:38:38,789
nutrients now let's talk more about the

4351
02:38:37,049 --> 02:38:41,159
pros and cons of bottled nutrients

4352
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:44,069
specifically before we even get started

4353
02:38:41,159 --> 02:38:46,559
I know the bottled nutrients are not for

4354
02:38:44,068 --> 02:38:48,659
everybody but I also know that amended

4355
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:49,379
soils and living soils are not for

4356
02:38:48,659 --> 02:38:51,389
everybody

4357
02:38:49,379 --> 02:38:53,519
so if you are a living soil guy if

4358
02:38:51,389 --> 02:38:55,108
you're an organic guy I get it you're

4359
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:57,120
probably already pulling your hair out

4360
02:38:55,109 --> 02:38:58,949
saying Jeff don't recommend bottles to

4361
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:01,800
new growers but you've got to keep in

4362
02:38:58,949 --> 02:39:04,649
mind not everybody is able to run a note

4363
02:39:01,799 --> 02:39:07,139
so grow not everybody is able to set up

4364
02:39:04,648 --> 02:39:08,760
a living soil system and also some

4365
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:10,738
people may just want to do bottled

4366
02:39:08,760 --> 02:39:12,930
nutrients if you're a chemistry student

4367
02:39:10,738 --> 02:39:14,698
or your mind thinks that way maybe you

4368
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:16,590
want a measuring device and a bottle of

4369
02:39:14,699 --> 02:39:18,840
liquid to measure and then mix and then

4370
02:39:16,590 --> 02:39:20,579
balance the pH maybe that's fun for you

4371
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,380
if you're more of a biology student

4372
02:39:20,579 --> 02:39:24,209
you're more into horticulture and more

4373
02:39:22,379 --> 02:39:26,938
into the dirt maybe you want to make the

4374
02:39:24,209 --> 02:39:29,159
pre amended soil it's all about doing it

4375
02:39:26,939 --> 02:39:31,470
your way and what makes you happy so I'm

4376
02:39:29,159 --> 02:39:33,889
gonna start with bottled nutrients the

4377
02:39:31,469 --> 02:39:36,148
pros to bottled nutrients are they are

4378
02:39:33,889 --> 02:39:38,129
available you can go to a growth store

4379
02:39:36,148 --> 02:39:40,500
and they are on the Shelf you can go to

4380
02:39:38,129 --> 02:39:42,389
Amazon and they are right there one of

4381
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:44,779
the major advantages to bottled

4382
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:47,430
nutrients is that they are available

4383
02:39:44,779 --> 02:39:50,819
another advantage to bottle nutrients is

4384
02:39:47,430 --> 02:39:53,370
an available nutrient feeding schedule

4385
02:39:50,818 --> 02:39:55,829
most of the reputable nutrient companies

4386
02:39:53,370 --> 02:39:58,350
have a website that includes a nutrient

4387
02:39:55,829 --> 02:40:00,809
calculator or a nutrient feed schedule

4388
02:39:58,350 --> 02:40:02,579
these are really easy to work with you

4389
02:40:00,809 --> 02:40:04,709
type in how many weeks you're going to

4390
02:40:02,579 --> 02:40:06,870
veg you type in how many weeks are going

4391
02:40:04,709 --> 02:40:08,938
to flower and that website makes a

4392
02:40:06,870 --> 02:40:11,370
custom nutrient regimen to fit your

4393
02:40:08,939 --> 02:40:14,100
schedule so week one of veg it will tell

4394
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:16,229
you week one feed this nutrient at this

4395
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:19,710
rate so it'll say week one use your base

4396
02:40:16,228 --> 02:40:22,108
nutrients at 25 mils use cal-mag at five

4397
02:40:19,709 --> 02:40:23,849
mils use whatever else at this many mils

4398
02:40:22,109 --> 02:40:26,370
per gallon of water so you know week one

4399
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:27,988
it's all right here listed out for me we

4400
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:30,689
- what do I need to feed on week two oh

4401
02:40:27,988 --> 02:40:32,189
it says 25 mils of this 10 mils of this

4402
02:40:30,689 --> 02:40:34,109
and 10 mils of this and it'll run you

4403
02:40:32,189 --> 02:40:36,300
all the way through the growth cycle all

4404
02:40:34,109 --> 02:40:38,040
the way up to the time you flush so if

4405
02:40:36,299 --> 02:40:39,719
you select a brand you buy their lineup

4406
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:41,260
you go to their website you've got basic

4407
02:40:39,719 --> 02:40:43,090
instructions on how to make

4408
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:44,739
Brande for optimal results for your

4409
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:46,689
plants now you will need to dial that in

4410
02:40:44,739 --> 02:40:48,639
not all plants are the same but they

4411
02:40:46,689 --> 02:40:50,829
give you a pretty good guideline on how

4412
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:52,358
to get started of course those companies

4413
02:40:50,829 --> 02:40:54,670
want you to buy more bottles more

4414
02:40:52,359 --> 02:40:57,700
frequently so you can always reduce the

4415
02:40:54,670 --> 02:41:00,430
recommended dosage maybe 50% maybe use

4416
02:40:57,700 --> 02:41:02,800
75% but there's no need to start off at

4417
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:04,898
the whole recommended dosage if you need

4418
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:06,699
more you can add more but you can never

4419
02:41:04,898 --> 02:41:08,829
take out once you've burnt the plants

4420
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:10,420
once they're burnt they are burned so

4421
02:41:08,829 --> 02:41:13,120
that's my recommendation start it maybe

4422
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:14,950
50 to 75% of the recommended dosage on

4423
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:17,079
those schedules and then increase as

4424
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:18,609
needed and if you get more experience

4425
02:41:17,079 --> 02:41:20,829
with the plants you will start to see if

4426
02:41:18,609 --> 02:41:22,390
they need less or more nutrients so

4427
02:41:20,829 --> 02:41:25,870
that's a really handy thing they have a

4428
02:41:22,389 --> 02:41:27,398
nutrient calculator on the website so

4429
02:41:25,870 --> 02:41:29,560
learning to grow with bottles can be

4430
02:41:27,398 --> 02:41:32,289
very easy because of the accessibility

4431
02:41:29,559 --> 02:41:34,449
and these websites another great thing

4432
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:37,630
about bottle nutrients is easily

4433
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:39,850
repeatable results we know exactly what

4434
02:41:37,629 --> 02:41:41,889
is in each bottle we know the ratios of

4435
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:44,890
each element in there so if we wrote

4436
02:41:41,889 --> 02:41:47,349
down how much we fed each nutrient each

4437
02:41:44,889 --> 02:41:50,049
feeding time and we also documented the

4438
02:41:47,350 --> 02:41:52,390
pH of those feedings we should be able

4439
02:41:50,049 --> 02:41:54,818
to have repeatable results using the

4440
02:41:52,389 --> 02:41:56,799
same product every time now you will

4441
02:41:54,818 --> 02:41:57,639
need similar environmental factors in

4442
02:41:56,799 --> 02:41:59,469
the room you'll need the same

4443
02:41:57,639 --> 02:42:00,278
temperature in the same humidity and the

4444
02:41:59,469 --> 02:42:02,228
same vbd

4445
02:42:00,279 --> 02:42:04,510
but as long as nothing changed too

4446
02:42:02,228 --> 02:42:05,920
drastically in your grow room you'll be

4447
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:07,779
able to repeat your last feeding

4448
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:10,559
schedule and your crop should come out

4449
02:42:07,779 --> 02:42:13,120
with similar quality to the last harvest

4450
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:15,369
alright those are some of the pros of

4451
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:16,390
working with bottled nutrients they are

4452
02:42:15,370 --> 02:42:18,399
readily available

4453
02:42:16,389 --> 02:42:20,228
there are nutrient schedules available

4454
02:42:18,398 --> 02:42:22,959
there are fairly easy to work with and

4455
02:42:20,228 --> 02:42:25,719
they are reliable we know exactly what

4456
02:42:22,959 --> 02:42:28,889
is in each bottle now let's talk about

4457
02:42:25,719 --> 02:42:31,599
some of the cons to bottled nutrients

4458
02:42:28,889 --> 02:42:34,059
most of the cons to working with bottle

4459
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:37,300
nutrients are all related and they are

4460
02:42:34,059 --> 02:42:39,489
mostly environmental factors first we

4461
02:42:37,299 --> 02:42:42,129
have a bunch of plastic bottles that is

4462
02:42:39,489 --> 02:42:44,439
environmentally unsustainable then we

4463
02:42:42,129 --> 02:42:47,318
are shipping plastic bottles filled with

4464
02:42:44,439 --> 02:42:49,600
water across the country most of the

4465
02:42:47,318 --> 02:42:52,239
nutrients we are buying are 80 to 90

4466
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:53,540
percent water so we are basically paying

4467
02:42:52,239 --> 02:42:55,789
a truck driver

4468
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:58,880
drive his truck across the country to

4469
02:42:55,790 --> 02:43:00,950
haul plastic bottles of water that is

4470
02:42:58,879 --> 02:43:02,539
completely unsustainable then once that

4471
02:43:00,950 --> 02:43:04,579
bottle gets to us we have it for a

4472
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:06,771
couple of weeks then what do we do we

4473
02:43:04,579 --> 02:43:09,079
throw away or recycle that plastic

4474
02:43:06,771 --> 02:43:11,300
bottle the recycling center in my area

4475
02:43:09,079 --> 02:43:13,280
will not take plastic bottles that had

4476
02:43:11,299 --> 02:43:15,170
nutrients or pesticides in them they

4477
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:17,180
cannot do it so they have to be thrown

4478
02:43:15,170 --> 02:43:19,579
away so the downside is that we are

4479
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:21,771
shipping plastic bottles filled with

4480
02:43:19,579 --> 02:43:23,360
water and then we're throwing plastic

4481
02:43:21,771 --> 02:43:26,000
bottles in a landfill it's very

4482
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:27,650
unsustainable so most of the reasons to

4483
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,139
not use bottled nutrients are

4484
02:43:27,649 --> 02:43:33,350
environmentally based and sustainability

4485
02:43:30,139 --> 02:43:35,659
based so most of it comes to working

4486
02:43:33,350 --> 02:43:37,670
with bottle nutrients our environmental

4487
02:43:35,659 --> 02:43:39,469
factors another thing to think about is

4488
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:41,780
are you gonna know how to grow when

4489
02:43:39,469 --> 02:43:44,059
those bottles go away if the gross store

4490
02:43:41,780 --> 02:43:45,800
is too close and society falls apart and

4491
02:43:44,059 --> 02:43:47,809
we have to go back to actually farming

4492
02:43:45,799 --> 02:43:49,909
are you gonna understand how to farm

4493
02:43:47,809 --> 02:43:52,699
your cannabis plants are you gonna be

4494
02:43:49,909 --> 02:43:55,100
stuck reaching for bottles that's where

4495
02:43:52,700 --> 02:43:57,890
the organic and the no-tell guys really

4496
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:59,510
laugh at the bottle growers so those are

4497
02:43:57,889 --> 02:44:02,119
the pros and cons of working with

4498
02:43:59,510 --> 02:44:04,790
bottled nutrients when you're shopping

4499
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:08,210
for bottled nutrients don't be sold by

4500
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:09,860
cool packaging and fancy logos also when

4501
02:44:08,209 --> 02:44:12,139
it comes to selecting nutrients if

4502
02:44:09,860 --> 02:44:14,030
you're a new grower I recommend you

4503
02:44:12,139 --> 02:44:15,920
stick with one brand

4504
02:44:14,030 --> 02:44:18,079
don't try to buy base nutrients from one

4505
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:20,271
company cal-mag from another company a

4506
02:44:18,079 --> 02:44:23,510
bloom booster from another company this

4507
02:44:20,271 --> 02:44:25,310
will lead to problems let me try to

4508
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:26,329
quickly explain why this to become

4509
02:44:25,309 --> 02:44:28,879
problematic

4510
02:44:26,329 --> 02:44:30,979
each company breaks down the required

4511
02:44:28,879 --> 02:44:33,679
elements for your plants in different

4512
02:44:30,979 --> 02:44:35,809
bottles different packages now some of

4513
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:37,550
these elements can be mixed together in

4514
02:44:35,809 --> 02:44:39,199
a bottle and some cannot be mixed

4515
02:44:37,549 --> 02:44:41,659
together in bottles you've got to make

4516
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:44,271
two different products some companies

4517
02:44:41,659 --> 02:44:45,860
want you to buy 30 different bottles so

4518
02:44:44,271 --> 02:44:47,900
that you can dial in that makes to have

4519
02:44:45,860 --> 02:44:50,840
exactly as much nitrogen as you want

4520
02:44:47,899 --> 02:44:52,940
exactly as much phosphorus exactly as

4521
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:55,219
much potassium while other companies

4522
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:57,230
will mix the nitrogen in one bottle and

4523
02:44:55,219 --> 02:44:59,449
the phosphorus and potassium and another

4524
02:44:57,229 --> 02:45:01,789
bottle they do that because it's easier

4525
02:44:59,450 --> 02:45:04,490
than having 30 bottles for your nutrient

4526
02:45:01,790 --> 02:45:06,260
line so each company knows what is in

4527
02:45:04,489 --> 02:45:07,129
each product they are putting out they

4528
02:45:06,260 --> 02:45:09,439
know that if the

4529
02:45:07,129 --> 02:45:11,509
put out a bass any bloom booster and you

4530
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:13,639
use them together they know they did not

4531
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:16,760
double up on any specific element in

4532
02:45:13,639 --> 02:45:18,559
those two bottles now if you grab a bass

4533
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:20,389
nutrient from one brand and a bloom

4534
02:45:18,559 --> 02:45:22,279
booster from another brand may never

4535
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:24,228
spoke to each other you may be doubling

4536
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:26,750
up and adding too much of one element to

4537
02:45:24,228 --> 02:45:28,699
your plants and not even realize it so

4538
02:45:26,750 --> 02:45:30,260
that's why I recommend picking one brand

4539
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:31,729
and sticking with it it has nothing to

4540
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:33,770
do with loyalty it has nothing to do

4541
02:45:31,728 --> 02:45:35,898
with marketing it just has to do with

4542
02:45:33,770 --> 02:45:38,600
making sure you do not double up and

4543
02:45:35,898 --> 02:45:40,670
burn your plants now I've got one more

4544
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:43,370
note about bottled nutrients I want to

4545
02:45:40,670 --> 02:45:46,489
discuss before we move on keep this in

4546
02:45:43,370 --> 02:45:48,710
mind our plant requires 16 elements for

4547
02:45:46,489 --> 02:45:52,159
healthy growth our plants require carbon

4548
02:45:48,709 --> 02:45:54,139
hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen now those

4549
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:56,420
come from the air and the water the

4550
02:45:54,139 --> 02:45:59,329
nitrogen comes from the air and the soil

4551
02:45:56,420 --> 02:46:04,969
also our plants want phosphorus

4552
02:45:59,329 --> 02:46:08,659
potassium calcium magnesium sulfur boron

4553
02:46:04,969 --> 02:46:12,938
chlorine copper iron manganese

4554
02:46:08,659 --> 02:46:15,500
molybdenum and C those are the necessary

4555
02:46:12,939 --> 02:46:17,659
elements as long as the nutrients you

4556
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:20,000
were buying have all of those required

4557
02:46:17,659 --> 02:46:22,579
elements you were covering most of your

4558
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,409
bases of course I would recommend adding

4559
02:46:22,579 --> 02:46:26,239
an enzymatic product some sort of

4560
02:46:24,409 --> 02:46:27,770
enzymes are going to help some sort of

4561
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:30,680
carbs are going to help and I always

4562
02:46:27,770 --> 02:46:33,860
recommend some sort of Route love some

4563
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:35,989
sort of beneficial microbes some mykos

4564
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:38,000
beneficial fungus beneficial bacteria

4565
02:46:35,989 --> 02:46:40,789
for your rhizosphere

4566
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:43,219
now you may also need a PK booster a

4567
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:45,590
bloom booster later in Flour but you

4568
02:46:43,219 --> 02:46:47,750
don't need a whole bunch of unnecessary

4569
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:49,939
ingredients for your plant as long as

4570
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:52,250
you're getting these 16 elements maybe

4571
02:46:49,939 --> 02:46:53,989
some enzymes maybe some carbs and I

4572
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:56,450
would always recommend some sort of a

4573
02:46:53,989 --> 02:46:58,250
root inoculate your plants will be happy

4574
02:46:56,450 --> 02:46:59,930
don't let the guy at the gross store

4575
02:46:58,250 --> 02:47:02,299
sell you stuff because he works on

4576
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:04,189
commission don't let the bottles at the

4577
02:47:02,299 --> 02:47:05,840
gross store sell you stuff because they

4578
02:47:04,189 --> 02:47:08,510
have really cool logos and they're well

4579
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:10,460
advertised when you go to a farm supply

4580
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:13,309
store everything comes in a white bag

4581
02:47:10,459 --> 02:47:15,500
with black writing and it all works all

4582
02:47:13,309 --> 02:47:17,299
of that fancy labeling and packaging is

4583
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:20,120
just something to charge you extra for

4584
02:47:17,299 --> 02:47:20,459
so don't fall for it now the next part

4585
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:23,190
of my

4586
02:47:20,459 --> 02:47:24,929
is to discuss my experience I try not to

4587
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:27,030
talk too much about specific brands in

4588
02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:29,130
here so I'm not going to go too far in

4589
02:47:27,030 --> 02:47:31,739
detail and I may not even say specific

4590
02:47:29,129 --> 02:47:33,689
brand names but you may catch on when I

4591
02:47:31,739 --> 02:47:35,789
first started growing I used a very

4592
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:37,860
popular brand of nutrients they are that

4593
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:38,670
company that has about 40 bottles

4594
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:41,340
available

4595
02:47:38,670 --> 02:47:44,129
I bought all 40 bottles I had a lot of

4596
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:46,380
fun mixing and dialing in that mix I did

4597
02:47:44,129 --> 02:47:48,779
that stuff for two or three years and I

4598
02:47:46,379 --> 02:47:51,119
got really good at it I was able to pull

4599
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:52,890
over two pounds from a normal thousand

4600
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:55,970
watt light and an indoor basement grow

4601
02:47:52,889 --> 02:47:58,739
reliably using this company's nutrients

4602
02:47:55,969 --> 02:48:01,109
unfortunately everything I grew with

4603
02:47:58,739 --> 02:48:04,409
that product tasted and smelled and

4604
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:06,540
looked exactly the same if I drew OG

4605
02:48:04,409 --> 02:48:08,728
Kush and super lemon haze in the same

4606
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:11,700
room with this nutrient line they would

4607
02:48:08,728 --> 02:48:13,260
both smell and look fairly similar there

4608
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:15,120
would be a lot of weed and it would be

4609
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:17,340
really potent but you could barely tell

4610
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,410
that I grew two different strains I

4611
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:21,149
didn't like that so I switched to

4612
02:48:19,409 --> 02:48:23,250
another company that was known to be

4613
02:48:21,149 --> 02:48:25,770
their competitor this company still had

4614
02:48:23,250 --> 02:48:27,690
quite a few bottles but not as many but

4615
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:29,700
this company was not nearly as expensive

4616
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:31,860
as the brand I had tried before so I

4617
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:33,659
started using their product I could tell

4618
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:35,760
a few weeks in that I was not satisfied

4619
02:48:33,659 --> 02:48:37,559
with that product either my plants were

4620
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:40,290
looking colorful I could tell a huge

4621
02:48:37,559 --> 02:48:42,029
difference in each varietal but there

4622
02:48:40,290 --> 02:48:43,620
was not going to be the weight or

4623
02:48:42,030 --> 02:48:45,450
potency that I'd gotten from the

4624
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:47,280
previous brand so that's when I had to

4625
02:48:45,450 --> 02:48:49,229
get rid of that product and move on to

4626
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:51,060
something else I've been doing a lot of

4627
02:48:49,228 --> 02:48:53,309
research and I had fallen in love with

4628
02:48:51,059 --> 02:48:54,420
botanic air now I know I told you I

4629
02:48:53,309 --> 02:48:57,209
wasn't going to talk about a lot of

4630
02:48:54,420 --> 02:48:59,850
brands but botanic air did a really good

4631
02:48:57,209 --> 02:49:02,459
job for me for a really long time I

4632
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:04,710
dialed in a beautiful botanic air recipe

4633
02:49:02,459 --> 02:49:06,899
with a couple of additives and I drew

4634
02:49:04,709 --> 02:49:09,239
some of the best cannabis I've ever

4635
02:49:06,899 --> 02:49:12,090
smoked with botanic air nutrients and a

4636
02:49:09,239 --> 02:49:14,190
few other additives I was ecstatic with

4637
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:16,620
my results from botanic air then I

4638
02:49:14,190 --> 02:49:18,930
noticed something started changing they

4639
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:20,729
were changing their recipes then one day

4640
02:49:18,930 --> 02:49:23,399
they announced that they had sold their

4641
02:49:20,728 --> 02:49:24,929
company noticing that the recipe was

4642
02:49:23,399 --> 02:49:26,609
changing and that my plants weren't as

4643
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:28,860
happy as they had been with that product

4644
02:49:26,610 --> 02:49:31,200
before already had me looking into

4645
02:49:28,860 --> 02:49:32,771
another product line I was also working

4646
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:34,480
in commercial grows and

4647
02:49:32,771 --> 02:49:37,061
experimenting with other product lines

4648
02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:39,251
and those groves being exposed to

4649
02:49:37,060 --> 02:49:41,050
commercial groves and the options to run

4650
02:49:39,251 --> 02:49:43,360
so many different products on so many

4651
02:49:41,050 --> 02:49:45,520
different levels let me see what worked

4652
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:47,771
and what did not work for me and the way

4653
02:49:45,521 --> 02:49:49,511
that I grow to knowing that botanic era

4654
02:49:47,771 --> 02:49:51,190
was changing their recipes and then

4655
02:49:49,511 --> 02:49:53,530
discovering that botanic air had sold

4656
02:49:51,190 --> 02:49:55,181
their brand to Hawthorn who is one of

4657
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:57,190
those companies I spoke of earlier that

4658
02:49:55,181 --> 02:49:59,381
we would rather not support I had to

4659
02:49:57,190 --> 02:50:00,790
make a change I had been using a

4660
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:02,649
powdered nutrient system and a

4661
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:05,501
commercial girl for quite a while and I

4662
02:50:02,649 --> 02:50:07,449
was ecstatic with the results it also

4663
02:50:05,501 --> 02:50:09,729
been learning to use another bottled

4664
02:50:07,450 --> 02:50:11,530
nutrient system in that grow and I was

4665
02:50:09,729 --> 02:50:14,800
completely satisfied with their results

4666
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:16,329
as well now over time I realized that

4667
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:18,251
the powdered nutrient company was

4668
02:50:16,329 --> 02:50:20,591
lacking just a couple of things that I

4669
02:50:18,251 --> 02:50:22,511
could probably boost up my production if

4670
02:50:20,591 --> 02:50:24,671
I added a few things so I took a couple

4671
02:50:22,511 --> 02:50:26,801
of products from that bottled nutrient

4672
02:50:24,671 --> 02:50:28,751
line and added those to my powdered

4673
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:30,850
nutrient line and by using two different

4674
02:50:28,751 --> 02:50:35,380
nutrient companies I have created a

4675
02:50:30,851 --> 02:50:36,940
stellar nutrient program for my grow now

4676
02:50:35,380 --> 02:50:39,279
earlier I did say that I would recommend

4677
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:40,751
you stick to one brand but once you

4678
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:42,251
learn the plants and you learn about the

4679
02:50:40,751 --> 02:50:44,470
nutrients you'll be able to customize

4680
02:50:42,251 --> 02:50:46,511
your mix to as many brands as you like

4681
02:50:44,470 --> 02:50:48,369
as long as you understand what's in each

4682
02:50:46,511 --> 02:50:50,290
bottle now I've been trying to avoid

4683
02:50:48,370 --> 02:50:51,910
giving you brand names and specific

4684
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:53,381
product names but I already know I'm

4685
02:50:51,909 --> 02:50:54,851
gonna get a bunch of emails if I don't

4686
02:50:53,380 --> 02:50:56,890
tell you what I use so I'm just gonna

4687
02:50:54,851 --> 02:50:59,319
spill the beans and tell you that I use

4688
02:50:56,890 --> 02:51:02,529
veg bloom powdered nutrients as my base

4689
02:50:59,319 --> 02:51:04,659
I use veg bloom HD I also use plus life

4690
02:51:02,530 --> 02:51:07,301
and when we get into flower I start

4691
02:51:04,659 --> 02:51:08,950
adding two grams of shine and as we get

4692
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:11,171
later in the flower I will increase the

4693
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:12,820
shine that's very strange specific I've

4694
02:51:11,171 --> 02:51:15,190
gotten up to four grams of shine per

4695
02:51:12,819 --> 02:51:18,251
gallon on some strains and they love it

4696
02:51:15,190 --> 02:51:20,739
to the veg blue mix I also add a little

4697
02:51:18,251 --> 02:51:23,110
bit of new millennium products I use the

4698
02:51:20,739 --> 02:51:25,060
Ruby the folic acid from new millennium

4699
02:51:23,110 --> 02:51:27,400
and I also use the carbonaria

4700
02:51:25,060 --> 02:51:29,380
the carbs from new millennium so I'm

4701
02:51:27,399 --> 02:51:31,270
adding a little fulvic acid to increase

4702
02:51:29,380 --> 02:51:34,359
uptake I'm adding a little bit of carbs

4703
02:51:31,271 --> 02:51:37,120
to give more energy then I also add slf

4704
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:39,461
100 enzymes and if the plants show me

4705
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:42,070
that they need more cal mag we use Cali

4706
02:51:39,460 --> 02:51:44,260
magic from gh in a commercial facility

4707
02:51:42,069 --> 02:51:46,379
and that is basically my nutrient

4708
02:51:44,261 --> 02:51:48,899
schedule for a large commercial

4709
02:51:46,379 --> 02:51:51,349
all right that's my rant on bottled

4710
02:51:48,898 --> 02:51:54,028
nutrients now let's talk more about

4711
02:51:51,350 --> 02:51:55,979
amended soils let's talk about super

4712
02:51:54,029 --> 02:51:57,689
soil let's talk about living soil and

4713
02:51:55,978 --> 02:52:00,448
we'll kind of touch on no-till

4714
02:51:57,689 --> 02:52:02,550
environments as well I don't have as

4715
02:52:00,449 --> 02:52:04,949
much experience in this realm so I will

4716
02:52:02,549 --> 02:52:06,358
not have as many details for you but I'm

4717
02:52:04,949 --> 02:52:08,310
sure that I'll be able to give you a

4718
02:52:06,359 --> 02:52:10,170
good enough breakdown to help you make

4719
02:52:08,309 --> 02:52:12,510
your decision and selecting your

4720
02:52:10,170 --> 02:52:14,398
nutrient or you're fertilizing style for

4721
02:52:12,510 --> 02:52:17,158
your new garden now let's talk a little

4722
02:52:14,398 --> 02:52:19,528
bit about what I mean by living soils

4723
02:52:17,158 --> 02:52:22,709
and super soils this is a more natural

4724
02:52:19,529 --> 02:52:25,350
more sustainable approach your super

4725
02:52:22,709 --> 02:52:28,049
soil can be as simple or as elaborate as

4726
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:30,988
you want to make it there are a lot of

4727
02:52:28,049 --> 02:52:33,389
recipes for usable super soils online

4728
02:52:30,988 --> 02:52:33,840
making your own living soil can be very

4729
02:52:33,389 --> 02:52:35,939
easy

4730
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:38,790
you are basically combining dried

4731
02:52:35,939 --> 02:52:41,068
amendments with soil or soilless mix and

4732
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:44,729
giving it the proper conditions and time

4733
02:52:41,068 --> 02:52:46,469
to cook and become alive the way I would

4734
02:52:44,728 --> 02:52:48,539
do it is through a large tarp on the

4735
02:52:46,469 --> 02:52:50,579
garage floor I would put out the amount

4736
02:52:48,540 --> 02:52:52,529
of soil that I need I would add all the

4737
02:52:50,579 --> 02:52:54,539
dried amendments on top of that I would

4738
02:52:52,529 --> 02:52:56,488
use a shovel and/or a pitchfork to stir

4739
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:59,100
that up real nice then once it's all

4740
02:52:56,488 --> 02:53:00,750
mixed up you add it to a trashcan you

4741
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:02,880
may need to add a little bit of moisture

4742
02:53:00,750 --> 02:53:04,859
to your new concoction just to get the

4743
02:53:02,879 --> 02:53:06,719
party started then you put the lid on

4744
02:53:04,859 --> 02:53:09,568
the trash can and store it in a warm

4745
02:53:06,719 --> 02:53:11,639
area and wait about thirty days over

4746
02:53:09,568 --> 02:53:13,709
time all of those amendments will start

4747
02:53:11,639 --> 02:53:16,049
breaking down in that soil and they will

4748
02:53:13,709 --> 02:53:18,269
create a living environment in that

4749
02:53:16,049 --> 02:53:20,429
trashcan when you take the lid off of

4750
02:53:18,270 --> 02:53:23,220
that trash can if you see a white layer

4751
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:25,529
of moldy funk on top of the dirt that is

4752
02:53:23,219 --> 02:53:29,010
exactly what we are looking for that is

4753
02:53:25,529 --> 02:53:30,600
life you have created living soil we

4754
02:53:29,010 --> 02:53:32,728
have basically mimicked what Mother

4755
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:34,800
Nature does inside of a small container

4756
02:53:32,728 --> 02:53:36,568
and we are giving the plants exactly

4757
02:53:34,799 --> 02:53:38,459
what they would want without force

4758
02:53:36,568 --> 02:53:40,469
feeding them anything that they do not

4759
02:53:38,459 --> 02:53:42,988
want now depending on the mineral

4760
02:53:40,469 --> 02:53:45,688
content of your newly made soil you may

4761
02:53:42,988 --> 02:53:47,760
need to add a little bit of uncharged

4762
02:53:45,689 --> 02:53:49,170
soil to your pots when you're putting

4763
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:51,300
new plants in there because that fresh

4764
02:53:49,170 --> 02:53:52,920
soil may be a little too potent it may

4765
02:53:51,299 --> 02:53:55,349
be a little too rich and you may need to

4766
02:53:52,920 --> 02:53:57,210
cut it down to reduce burning your new

4767
02:53:55,350 --> 02:53:59,700
baby plants so that's something to think

4768
02:53:57,209 --> 02:54:01,679
about when working with a living soil

4769
02:53:59,700 --> 02:54:03,930
now let's talk a little bit about the

4770
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:07,200
pros and cons of a living soil

4771
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:09,870
environment the main the best part is

4772
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:11,400
that it is organic as long as everything

4773
02:54:09,870 --> 02:54:14,280
you put in there is organic

4774
02:54:11,399 --> 02:54:17,520
you have got an organic grow it is also

4775
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:19,470
very sustainable most of those dried

4776
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:22,319
amendments come in a box that box is

4777
02:54:19,469 --> 02:54:24,299
either compostable or recyclable also

4778
02:54:22,319 --> 02:54:26,279
there's not a bunch of water in that box

4779
02:54:24,299 --> 02:54:28,109
to ship around so you are getting the

4780
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:30,479
product the product goes into the soil

4781
02:54:28,110 --> 02:54:33,390
the Box goes into recycling there's very

4782
02:54:30,478 --> 02:54:35,760
minimal waste some of those meals are

4783
02:54:33,389 --> 02:54:38,219
actually waste products that we are

4784
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:40,319
reusing so we are actually recycling and

4785
02:54:38,219 --> 02:54:42,688
putting a waste product to use by

4786
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:45,809
putting it in our garden so that's a

4787
02:54:42,689 --> 02:54:47,579
huge advantage of living soil situations

4788
02:54:45,809 --> 02:54:49,829
also when you start running a living

4789
02:54:47,579 --> 02:54:51,870
soil or an organic garden you will also

4790
02:54:49,829 --> 02:54:54,870
probably end up creating a compost bin

4791
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:57,090
in your home which will also create more

4792
02:54:54,870 --> 02:54:59,040
environmental awareness which will just

4793
02:54:57,090 --> 02:55:00,899
cause a chain reaction once you start

4794
02:54:59,040 --> 02:55:02,760
growing organically you'll start seeing

4795
02:55:00,899 --> 02:55:04,770
things on a more organic level in your

4796
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:06,329
whole life it'll affect your eating bill

4797
02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:07,920
affect your shopping you'll start

4798
02:55:06,329 --> 02:55:10,049
thinking about the earth differently as

4799
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:12,030
a whole so that's one of the benefits

4800
02:55:10,049 --> 02:55:14,849
and also some of the side effects of

4801
02:55:12,030 --> 02:55:16,590
growing any living soil environment if

4802
02:55:14,850 --> 02:55:18,450
you start working into like a no-till

4803
02:55:16,590 --> 02:55:20,579
environment another huge advantage is

4804
02:55:18,450 --> 02:55:23,040
very minimal waste when it comes to

4805
02:55:20,579 --> 02:55:25,260
no-till there is essentially no waste

4806
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:27,780
in a no-till environment you harvest a

4807
02:55:25,260 --> 02:55:30,540
plant you hang the plant that gets

4808
02:55:27,780 --> 02:55:32,909
trimmed and dry and cured and consumed

4809
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:35,280
the waste goes back into your compost

4810
02:55:32,909 --> 02:55:37,260
pile that pod where we just cut that

4811
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:39,120
plan out of we're gonna gently cut the

4812
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:41,040
root ball out of there just just that

4813
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:42,720
big root ball just take that out then

4814
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:44,729
we're gonna put another clone in that

4815
02:55:42,719 --> 02:55:46,469
spot and we're gonna backfill that with

4816
02:55:44,728 --> 02:55:48,869
composted dirt that we've got in our

4817
02:55:46,469 --> 02:55:52,619
compost pile and now we've got a fresh

4818
02:55:48,870 --> 02:55:55,140
plant ready to go with zero waste so

4819
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:57,329
that is a huge advantage to a no-till

4820
02:55:55,139 --> 02:55:59,189
garden people growing cocoa or growing

4821
02:55:57,329 --> 02:56:01,920
soil they've got to figure out how to

4822
02:55:59,189 --> 02:56:04,229
either recycle or get rid of all of that

4823
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:06,659
cocoa or soil and if you've got more

4824
02:56:04,228 --> 02:56:09,809
than four or five three gallon pots

4825
02:56:06,659 --> 02:56:11,250
worth of used cocoa or soil it becomes a

4826
02:56:09,809 --> 02:56:11,880
challenge to try to get rid of that you

4827
02:56:11,250 --> 02:56:13,740
can't just

4828
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:15,600
in the backyard someone's gonna notice

4829
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:16,921
that big fresh pile of dirt with a bunch

4830
02:56:15,601 --> 02:56:18,661
of perlite in there and they're gonna

4831
02:56:16,921 --> 02:56:20,490
say perlite what's he doing and it's

4832
02:56:18,661 --> 02:56:22,290
gonna just start triggering things so

4833
02:56:20,490 --> 02:56:24,960
that's hugely advantageous to not have

4834
02:56:22,290 --> 02:56:26,911
any waste when it comes to no-till

4835
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:30,270
gardening another huge advantage is

4836
02:56:26,911 --> 02:56:31,979
there are minimal bug threats it seems

4837
02:56:30,271 --> 02:56:34,501
like when you establish a no-till garden

4838
02:56:31,979 --> 02:56:36,751
it comes right along with beneficial

4839
02:56:34,501 --> 02:56:39,240
insects and if you do introduce any

4840
02:56:36,751 --> 02:56:41,281
spider mites or unwanted pests those

4841
02:56:39,240 --> 02:56:43,081
beneficial insects are already there and

4842
02:56:41,281 --> 02:56:45,451
they'll creep in and destroy the

4843
02:56:43,081 --> 02:56:47,550
population before it gets out of control

4844
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:49,770
so that's always a good thing with the

4845
02:56:47,550 --> 02:56:51,600
no-till garden our friend frosty was on

4846
02:56:49,771 --> 02:56:53,461
the show a while back he was talking

4847
02:56:51,601 --> 02:56:55,171
about going hiking and then walking

4848
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:56,490
right into his notes he'll grow and I

4849
02:56:55,171 --> 02:56:58,800
said bro don't she's gonna worry about

4850
02:56:56,490 --> 02:57:00,210
maybe gathering a spider mite on your

4851
02:56:58,800 --> 02:57:01,770
shoe and taking spider mites into that

4852
02:57:00,210 --> 02:57:03,600
girl and he said bro that's just food

4853
02:57:01,771 --> 02:57:06,061
for the predator mites that are already

4854
02:57:03,601 --> 02:57:07,740
in there so the no-till guys seem to be

4855
02:57:06,060 --> 02:57:10,140
fairly confident in their pest

4856
02:57:07,740 --> 02:57:12,540
management system so some of the major

4857
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:15,210
advantages to a living soil or an

4858
02:57:12,540 --> 02:57:17,100
organic system are it is clean and

4859
02:57:15,210 --> 02:57:18,661
organic as long as everything you put in

4860
02:57:17,101 --> 02:57:21,361
there is organic you know that

4861
02:57:18,661 --> 02:57:23,851
everything comes out of there is organic

4862
02:57:21,361 --> 02:57:26,761
that means a lot to a lot of people also

4863
02:57:23,851 --> 02:57:29,490
it is sustainable if the grow shop burns

4864
02:57:26,761 --> 02:57:31,560
down if Amazon shuts down if you learn

4865
02:57:29,490 --> 02:57:33,210
how to grow like a farmer when the [ __ ]

4866
02:57:31,560 --> 02:57:34,470
hits the fan you'll be one of the few

4867
02:57:33,210 --> 02:57:37,110
people out there growing your own food

4868
02:57:34,470 --> 02:57:38,850
and growing herb for us to smoke and

4869
02:57:37,111 --> 02:57:40,771
that goes right along with what I call a

4870
02:57:38,851 --> 02:57:42,480
side effect you start becoming more

4871
02:57:40,771 --> 02:57:44,311
aware of what you're doing to the

4872
02:57:42,479 --> 02:57:46,081
environment when you go grocery shopping

4873
02:57:44,310 --> 02:57:48,270
you'll find yourself in the produce

4874
02:57:46,081 --> 02:57:50,011
section trying to buy more things that

4875
02:57:48,271 --> 02:57:52,440
have something you can add to your

4876
02:57:50,011 --> 02:57:54,751
compost bin after you eat so it will

4877
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:56,971
totally affect the way you shop the way

4878
02:57:54,751 --> 02:57:58,320
you eat and the way you live and when

4879
02:57:56,970 --> 02:58:00,751
you head into the notes Hill range

4880
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:04,950
another huge advantage is minimal waste

4881
02:58:00,751 --> 02:58:06,661
and very minimal pests now once we've

4882
02:58:04,950 --> 02:58:08,460
got our living soil established and

4883
02:58:06,661 --> 02:58:10,681
we've got our garden going if we do

4884
02:58:08,460 --> 02:58:12,899
notice some sort of a deficiency there

4885
02:58:10,681 --> 02:58:15,121
are ways that we can add nutrients to

4886
02:58:12,899 --> 02:58:17,671
our organic system without introducing

4887
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:20,520
bottled nutrients it is very easy to

4888
02:58:17,671 --> 02:58:22,531
brew up a compost tea Shawn and Jessi

4889
02:58:20,521 --> 02:58:23,250
have talked about compost teas a lot on

4890
02:58:22,531 --> 02:58:25,109
this show

4891
02:58:23,250 --> 02:58:27,148
I'm not gonna go too deep into making a

4892
02:58:25,109 --> 02:58:29,609
tea you basically throw amendments in a

4893
02:58:27,148 --> 02:58:31,949
bucket and add a narrator and you let it

4894
02:58:29,609 --> 02:58:33,809
bubble for a certain amount of time then

4895
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:35,790
depending on the strength of the tea and

4896
02:58:33,809 --> 02:58:37,920
the type of tea we made we either dilute

4897
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:41,130
it or we water it directly into the

4898
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:43,738
plants as long as everything you used to

4899
02:58:41,129 --> 02:58:47,129
make your tea was organic your grow is

4900
02:58:43,738 --> 02:58:49,139
still fully organic another option for

4901
02:58:47,129 --> 02:58:52,079
adding nutrients to a slowing organic

4902
02:58:49,139 --> 02:58:54,119
garden is to top dress you can place

4903
02:58:52,079 --> 02:58:56,189
organic amendments on top of the soil

4904
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:58,710
and water them in just like you would a

4905
02:58:56,189 --> 02:59:00,630
bottled nutrient this may not work as

4906
02:58:58,709 --> 02:59:02,519
rapidly as it would when using bottled

4907
02:59:00,629 --> 02:59:05,549
nutrients because you will need time for

4908
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:07,859
the organic amendments to break down but

4909
02:59:05,549 --> 02:59:10,769
top dressing is certainly a way to add

4910
02:59:07,859 --> 02:59:13,649
nutrients to an organic living soil

4911
02:59:10,770 --> 02:59:15,810
without introducing bottled nutrients so

4912
02:59:13,648 --> 02:59:17,309
if you set up a living soil or a super

4913
02:59:15,809 --> 02:59:19,409
soil and you see those plants are

4914
02:59:17,309 --> 02:59:21,028
slowing down or if you see those plants

4915
02:59:19,409 --> 02:59:23,488
are showing you some type of deficiency

4916
02:59:21,029 --> 02:59:25,439
you should be able to brew up a compost

4917
02:59:23,488 --> 02:59:27,659
tea or top dress with the appropriate

4918
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:29,970
amendment to add the missing element

4919
02:59:27,659 --> 02:59:31,709
that those plants will need things I've

4920
02:59:29,969 --> 02:59:34,590
heard Jessi and Sean talk about top

4921
02:59:31,709 --> 02:59:37,108
dressing quite often our fishmeal kelp

4922
02:59:34,590 --> 02:59:39,389
meal alfalfa and comfrey

4923
02:59:37,109 --> 02:59:41,340
so now before I get myself too far off

4924
02:59:39,389 --> 02:59:44,099
track let's talk about some of the cons

4925
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:46,710
of working with a living soil or a super

4926
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:48,960
soil type environment the downside is

4927
02:59:46,709 --> 02:59:50,519
the mix work if you don't have a space

4928
02:59:48,959 --> 02:59:52,829
to mix this if you don't have a space to

4929
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:54,930
cook the soil it might not be an option

4930
02:59:52,829 --> 02:59:57,568
it does take a lot of space to create

4931
02:59:54,930 --> 03:00:00,270
this soil then it does take a trash can

4932
02:59:57,568 --> 03:00:01,709
worth of space to store this soil now

4933
03:00:00,270 --> 03:00:04,649
that leads me right into the next part

4934
03:00:01,709 --> 03:00:06,059
which is the cook time maybe you decided

4935
03:00:04,648 --> 03:00:08,278
you want to start a garden and you're

4936
03:00:06,059 --> 03:00:10,350
going to start it next week you need at

4937
03:00:08,279 --> 03:00:12,930
least 30 days to brew up a batch of

4938
03:00:10,350 --> 03:00:15,689
super soil you were already running late

4939
03:00:12,930 --> 03:00:17,609
so the downside is the cook time you've

4940
03:00:15,689 --> 03:00:20,639
got to mix it you've got to let it cook

4941
03:00:17,609 --> 03:00:23,010
and come alive now another disadvantage

4942
03:00:20,639 --> 03:00:25,799
to working with a super soil or a living

4943
03:00:23,010 --> 03:00:28,318
soil is understanding the richness of

4944
03:00:25,799 --> 03:00:30,119
the soil you just made as that soil too

4945
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:32,488
hot for little plants will it be okay

4946
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:33,940
for little plants a new grower may not

4947
03:00:32,488 --> 03:00:35,469
have the eye to see

4948
03:00:33,940 --> 03:00:37,120
those plants are having problems and

4949
03:00:35,469 --> 03:00:38,560
they won't know how to identify it and

4950
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:40,720
they won't know how to prevent or

4951
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:43,590
correct an issue if they see it in a

4952
03:00:40,719 --> 03:00:46,299
living soil so that could be problematic

4953
03:00:43,590 --> 03:00:48,640
another disadvantage to working with the

4954
03:00:46,299 --> 03:00:51,729
living soil is if you do have a pest

4955
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:54,279
issue you are very limited on approaches

4956
03:00:51,729 --> 03:00:57,340
for eradicating your pests you've got to

4957
03:00:54,280 --> 03:01:00,250
stick to organic options if you've got a

4958
03:00:57,340 --> 03:01:02,440
soil pest problem your options are very

4959
03:01:00,250 --> 03:01:04,329
limited like we said earlier you

4960
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:06,069
shouldn't encounter too many problems in

4961
03:01:04,329 --> 03:01:08,049
an organic soil environment because

4962
03:01:06,069 --> 03:01:10,659
we've got enough microorganisms there to

4963
03:01:08,049 --> 03:01:12,759
keep that in check but if you do end up

4964
03:01:10,659 --> 03:01:15,310
with a root problem you are very limited

4965
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:17,890
on ways you can treat you cannot treat

4966
03:01:15,310 --> 03:01:19,899
your living soil with a root drench if

4967
03:01:17,890 --> 03:01:21,729
you were running a soil garden and you

4968
03:01:19,899 --> 03:01:24,369
are feeding with bottled nutrients and

4969
03:01:21,729 --> 03:01:26,560
you ran into a root problem like a root

4970
03:01:24,370 --> 03:01:29,590
pest you would be able to do a root

4971
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:32,199
drench with a pesticide either botanic

4972
03:01:29,590 --> 03:01:34,239
garden ax or evergreen you just mix up

4973
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:35,920
fifteen to thirty miles per gallon any

4974
03:01:34,239 --> 03:01:38,110
water that right in with your feeding

4975
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:41,049
solution and that will eradicate any

4976
03:01:38,110 --> 03:01:43,420
soil-borne pests if we go feeding

4977
03:01:41,049 --> 03:01:45,789
Botanic Garden Max or evergreen to a

4978
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:48,340
living soil situation we basically

4979
03:01:45,790 --> 03:01:50,561
destroy the entire environment we worked

4980
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:51,969
to create in there so that is something

4981
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:54,010
to keep in mind when you were thinking

4982
03:01:51,969 --> 03:01:56,170
about your nutrient and feeding regimen

4983
03:01:54,010 --> 03:01:58,810
are you going to be able to implement

4984
03:01:56,170 --> 03:02:02,170
your integrated pest management system

4985
03:01:58,810 --> 03:02:05,140
with your nutrient and soil selections

4986
03:02:02,170 --> 03:02:07,719
it's all got to work together so those

4987
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:10,180
are basically the pros and cons of

4988
03:02:07,719 --> 03:02:12,279
working with a living organic soil

4989
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:14,649
basically you've got an organic

4990
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:17,320
sustainable garden that should feel good

4991
03:02:14,649 --> 03:02:18,969
to grow the only real disadvantage that

4992
03:02:17,319 --> 03:02:21,010
I can think of when it comes to growing

4993
03:02:18,969 --> 03:02:22,959
any living soil or an organic type

4994
03:02:21,010 --> 03:02:25,120
environment is it it takes a lot of work

4995
03:02:22,959 --> 03:02:27,339
ahead there's a lot of work that has to

4996
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:29,829
happen before you start growing but that

4997
03:02:27,340 --> 03:02:32,649
work ahead may be exactly what some

4998
03:02:29,829 --> 03:02:34,000
people want that may be your style maybe

4999
03:02:32,649 --> 03:02:35,739
you're one of the people that enjoy the

5000
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,149
smell of that rich dirt maybe you're the

5001
03:02:35,739 --> 03:02:39,159
guy that enjoys mixing all those

5002
03:02:37,149 --> 03:02:40,629
amendments together maybe you like

5003
03:02:39,159 --> 03:02:42,729
having worm castings under your

5004
03:02:40,629 --> 03:02:44,409
fingernails maybe you're into brewing

5005
03:02:42,729 --> 03:02:46,239
your own compost peas are waiting for

5006
03:02:44,409 --> 03:02:47,101
your own fermented plant juices to

5007
03:02:46,239 --> 03:02:49,050
ferment

5008
03:02:47,101 --> 03:02:51,900
it's all about what makes you happy with

5009
03:02:49,050 --> 03:02:54,210
your gross style also it's all about

5010
03:02:51,899 --> 03:02:56,790
your abilities and what is available to

5011
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:58,380
you if you live in a big city maybe some

5012
03:02:56,790 --> 03:03:00,510
of those organic amendments won't be as

5013
03:02:58,380 --> 03:03:02,609
available to you if you live in a small

5014
03:03:00,511 --> 03:03:04,351
city a small farm area you'll have

5015
03:03:02,610 --> 03:03:07,110
access to all of those organic inputs

5016
03:03:04,351 --> 03:03:09,239
but you may not have access to bottles

5017
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:11,819
and a hydro store so it may come down to

5018
03:03:09,239 --> 03:03:14,069
what's available in your area yes most

5019
03:03:11,819 --> 03:03:15,659
of us do have access to Amazon but not

5020
03:03:14,069 --> 03:03:17,851
everybody can afford everything on

5021
03:03:15,659 --> 03:03:20,489
Amazon so you may have to adjust to your

5022
03:03:17,851 --> 03:03:22,319
budget as well the main point of your

5023
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:24,300
garden is to produce a product that

5024
03:03:22,319 --> 03:03:25,890
makes you happy so as long as you are

5025
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:27,390
happy with your garden as long as you're

5026
03:03:25,890 --> 03:03:29,159
having fun as long as you're enjoying

5027
03:03:27,390 --> 03:03:30,720
yourself and as long as you are getting

5028
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:33,239
a product at the end that makes you

5029
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:35,850
happy you are doing it right so set up a

5030
03:03:33,239 --> 03:03:37,530
grow that you love or use the scientist

5031
03:03:35,851 --> 03:03:39,541
do you want to be in there with a couple

5032
03:03:37,530 --> 03:03:41,940
of measuring devices and bottles and

5033
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:44,430
measuring out 15 mils of this and pour

5034
03:03:41,940 --> 03:03:46,291
it in now let's measure out 35 mils of

5035
03:03:44,431 --> 03:03:48,751
this and pour it in and mix it now let's

5036
03:03:46,290 --> 03:03:49,979
test the PPM's see what that is whoo

5037
03:03:48,751 --> 03:03:52,229
that looks real good now let's adjust

5038
03:03:49,979 --> 03:03:54,511
the pH now let's water the plants are

5039
03:03:52,229 --> 03:03:56,130
you bad guy or either guy that wants to

5040
03:03:54,511 --> 03:03:57,989
mix up everything at the beginning and

5041
03:03:56,130 --> 03:03:59,850
then just add water and then just watch

5042
03:03:57,989 --> 03:04:01,290
the plants grow maybe you're the guy

5043
03:03:59,851 --> 03:04:02,641
that wants to brew up a bunch of teas

5044
03:04:01,290 --> 03:04:05,189
maybe you're that guy making the

5045
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:07,050
fermented plant juices it's all up to

5046
03:04:05,190 --> 03:04:08,640
you you can be the scientist you can be

5047
03:04:07,050 --> 03:04:10,229
the farmer you can be somewhere in

5048
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:12,081
between as long as you were happy with

5049
03:04:10,229 --> 03:04:14,939
your garden that's really what matters

5050
03:04:12,081 --> 03:04:16,319
now there are many more ways to feed

5051
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:18,810
your plants I'm sure there are many more

5052
03:04:16,319 --> 03:04:21,479
nutrient styles and fertilizing systems

5053
03:04:18,810 --> 03:04:23,880
one thing I should mention is aquaponics

5054
03:04:21,479 --> 03:04:25,859
I am not experienced in aquaponics I

5055
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:27,540
can't teach you about aquaponics but I

5056
03:04:25,860 --> 03:04:29,101
feel like we would be leaving out all of

5057
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:31,520
our friends at the growing with fishes

5058
03:04:29,101 --> 03:04:34,471
podcast if I didn't at least mention

5059
03:04:31,521 --> 03:04:36,450
aquaponics as a very viable and

5060
03:04:34,470 --> 03:04:38,040
sustainable way of fertilizing your

5061
03:04:36,450 --> 03:04:40,171
cannabis garden so big shout out to my

5062
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:42,239
friends that growing with fishes I find

5063
03:04:40,171 --> 03:04:44,069
it fascinating but I do not have any

5064
03:04:42,239 --> 03:04:47,101
experience so I can't teach you anything

5065
03:04:44,069 --> 03:04:50,130
about it so that is my podcast about

5066
03:04:47,101 --> 03:04:52,711
selecting nutrients and fertilizers for

5067
03:04:50,130 --> 03:04:54,540
your new cannabis grow remember the most

5068
03:04:52,710 --> 03:04:56,489
important part is that you are having

5069
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:58,500
fun and that you are happy with what

5070
03:04:56,489 --> 03:04:59,909
comes out of your garden also try to

5071
03:04:58,501 --> 03:05:01,290
keep in mind the ethic

5072
03:04:59,909 --> 03:05:03,869
whoever you were giving your money to

5073
03:05:01,290 --> 03:05:06,601
try to shop with people who support our

5074
03:05:03,870 --> 03:05:08,010
community and our industry if I left

5075
