31

33
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:35,928
and we will wrap it up by talking about

34
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:38,030
what 4/20 means to me so ladies and

35

saved here in my phone I'm gonna go

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,079
right to the first message this one

42
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:52,759
comes from you know I don't know if

43
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,038
people want their names set on the show

44
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,778
so I'm not going to say your name but

45
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,189
I'm going to send everybody a big THANK

46
00:01:56,778 --> 00:02:00,019
YOU and give everybody much love and

47
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:01,908
respect for all of the responses I got

48
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,739
from the listeners thank you the

49
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,439
listener interaction means a lot to me

50
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:10,068
so this first message goes a lot like

51
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:12,379
this to me 4/20 means community it means

52
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,289
normalization decriminalization and

53
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,539
legalization I first felt that over 20

54
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:20,298
years ago as a student in Vermont our

55
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:22,519
sociology professor told us that on 4/20

56
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,230
at 4/20 it's a tradition for students to

57
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,580
gather on campus in the main lawn and

58
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,649
smoke

59
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,140
together celebrate together in public

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,969
the cops practiced tolerance that day it

61
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,829
was a beautiful progressive thing to

62
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:35,469
take part in and that sense of community

63
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,570
surrounding 4/20 has always stuck with

64
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,120
me then they wrapped up this message

65
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,859
with a green heart emoji which tops it

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,960
all off beautifully so to this person

67
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,550
4/20 represents community I'm sure that

68
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,730
we're going to see that as a trend and a

69
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,770
lot of these messages I love that

70
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,929
colleges were accepting to the 4/20

71
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,640
movement I am really I appreciate that

72
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,439
some of the professor's and that the

73
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,179
people at universities and colleges were

74
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,789
kind of tolerant and accepting and

75
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,740
encouraging of the 4/20 movement I find

76
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:05,019
that to be quite progressive so thank

77
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,000

78

message we're gonna go through these

212
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,879
messages quite quickly and then we may

213
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,860

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,270
this one they did not leave an alias oh

216
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,978
it says feel free to use my name so that

217
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,079
makes it easy the message goes like this

218
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:31,089
hey I love your show I thank you for

219

hey that's pretty cool sometimes Monday

221
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,220
can be a kind of a pain in the ass for

222
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,780
some people and that's why I put out

223
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,639
shows on Monday because it makes Monday

224
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,689
suck a little bit less for those people

225
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,460
who have to go to a job they don't

226
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,050
completely enjoy so that's cool that I'm

227
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,180
making your Monday another Friday that's

228
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,490
pretty rad the message keeps going he

229
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,990
says you are smart very smart and then

230
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,900
here's the part we're looking for he

231
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,668
says 4/20 is to me a day that I'm going

232
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,348
to take off work and literally wake up

233
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,569
in bed with the joint rolled and a hot

234
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:01,149
nail and keep myself medicated all day

235
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,800
and hang out and smoke with my friends

236

going to spend 4/20 with his friends

238
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,069

239
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,109
he says friends that smoke or not then

240
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,149

00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:55,569
my first 4/20 was when I was like 19 and

260
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,310
I'm 32 now being my homeboy got some

261
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,070
purple beautiful buds that I've never

262
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:03,039
seen anything so pretty two years ago my

263
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,778
best friend overdosed on heroin three

264
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,129
days before my birthday well that is a

265
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,929
rough story already

266
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,019
so last year I went and spent all my

267
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:12,458
money on a trip by myself to the San

268
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,959
Bernadino four-twenty High Times

269
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:16,659
Cannabis Cup I had to stop myself I

270
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,750
wanted to say San Bernadino the San

271
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:21,939
Bernadino 420 High Times Cannabis Cup ah

272
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,230

273
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,029
you were ripped off I'm not gonna touch

274
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,920
that statement then you say but stay

275
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:28,000
positive I guess yes stay positive that

276
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,439
they were at least able to have that

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,208
event I understand that it did get weird

278
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,500
that year things didn't go perfectly but

279
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,328
at least you got to go have a good time

280
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,309
be around the cannabis community stay

281
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:37,958
positive that's all we can do then he

282
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,169
goes on to say I guess I've just shut

283
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,729
down about growing but if cannabis just

284
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,469
makes me happy it gives me something to

285
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,420
be happy about and makes me feel good

286
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,389
and I feel close to my homeboy on the

287
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,740

288

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,278
then he says he'd like to work no more

325
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:03,188
than four days and be off every

326
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:06,519
afternoon by 4:20 then he says 4:20 is

327
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:08,679
when I get to chill and relax hey that's

328
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,139
a great one man you work too hard so you

329
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,169
work hard for that 420 break I bet that

330
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:16,419
is nice after 60 to 90 hours of work

331
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:18,349
that is tremendous that is putting it in

332
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,299
so you really do deserve that's

333
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,740
that is medical marijuana I don't know

334
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,569
if you're smoking for recreational

335
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,730
purposes that's medical at that point

336
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,870
you deserve it bro and thanks for the

337
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:31,370
update on what 4/20 means to you all

338
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,929
right podcast world those were all of

339
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,659
the listeners submissions about what

340
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:37,819
4/20 means to you I think it is time for

341
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:39,379
me to tell you what 4/20 means to me and

342
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,150
then we will play a couple of audio

343
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,090
clips from some of our friends

344
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:46,100
what does 4/20 mean to me 4/20 means a

345
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,730
lot of things to me I have been involved

346
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,980
in participating in celebrating 4/20 for

347
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,200
a very long time I probably actually

348
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,269
discovered the phrase 4/20 early in high

349
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,000
school probably around 8th or 9th grade

350
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:01,309
my first fish show is in 95 and I know

351
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,980
we were talking about 420 at fish shows

352
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:06,379
so 420 I've been celebrating talking

353
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,190
about participating I've been in the 420

354
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:11,299
scene since the early 90s 420 has

355
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,610
evolved and changed into a lot of

356
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:16,009
different things over the years as I

357
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,659
have grown when I first discovered 420

358
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,279
like most of us it was kind of the way

359
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:20,480
that me and my bros would tell each

360
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,370
other you want to go smoke some weed

361
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,170
without everybody else knowing that we

362
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,610
were gonna go smoke some weed that

363
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,929
didn't last very long when you're a high

364
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,120
school kid you think you've got some

365
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:30,289
code it's not good code if you're a high

366
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,060
school kid you're listening you should

367
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,439
not be listening but if you've got some

368
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,699
code that you think your teachers or

369
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,220
your parents or somebody know that means

370
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,030
we're gonna go do something stupid

371
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,649
everybody knows you're gonna go do some

372
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,079
[ __ ] stupid your codes not working so

373
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,970
4/20 was our little code that me and Rob

374
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,050
or me and Kris or all of us would be

375
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,970
somewhere and we'd say I think it's

376
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,990
pretty close to 4/20 and other people

377
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,490
that look at their clock and say it's

378
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,409
only 115 I don't know what these

379
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,909
dumbasses are talking about but most of

380
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,829
the other people that knew anybody that

381
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:56,329
was cool sometimes too many people that

382
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,190
weren't cool well look at us and go oh

383
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,740
yeah it's 4/20 and it come with us or

384
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,450
they would ruin our 4/20 plan so back in

385
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,580
the day when it started that was our way

386
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,290
to say let's go smoke bro is almost time

387
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,650
to go sneak away go smoke a ball

388
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,089
together

389
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,220
go get the crew together and have a good

390
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,410
time then people started catching on

391
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,810
then it started getting really really

392
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,819
popular then around the same time at

393
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,709
4:20 got super popular and super

394
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,320
commercialized I was entering the

395
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,900
commercial cannabis industry that is

396
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,660
where my view my stance my opinion of

397
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,189
4/20 shifted a little bit when you

398
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,019
worked in the commercial cannabis

399
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,089
industry if you were in the production

400
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,708
side if you were in the commercial side

401
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,740
especially if you were in the packaging

402
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,838
side or the retail side 420 can be a

403
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,028
headache it is a pain in the ass it is

404
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,309
almost a lot of my friends this is the

405
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,509
week of 4/20 and I'm not going to see a

406
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:46,129
lot of my friends because they're

407
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,938
working overtime they're stuck at work

408
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,249
getting prepared

409
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:50,240
they're running 420 sales many of my

410
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,249
friends that are running their own

411
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,980
businesses are away at conventions

412
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,269
trying to manage their business 4/20

413
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,949
gets hectic when you were in the

414
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:00,499
cannabis business and you've got

415
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:02,688
responsibilities about two weeks before

416
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:05,269
to 4/20 we started getting prepared

417
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:07,698
we've got to roll all of the pre rolls

418
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,828
people come from all over the damn

419
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:11,659
planet to Colorado and they all want a

420
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,849
pre-roll we have got to start rolling

421
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,438
pre-rolls all of the employees that

422
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,509
don't have something to do are put on a

423
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,458
pre roll station start rolling joints we

424
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,169
need all of them so there's a lot of pre

425
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,268
rolls to be done there's a lot of

426
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,429
preparation like packaging all of the

427
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,049
concentrates you buy they all come in

428
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:28,519
ridiculous amounts of packaging they

429
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,498
have to be weighed by somebody to have

430
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,120
to be packaged by somebody somebody has

431
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:34,339
to do all of that we sell a lot of

432
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,808
product over the 420 holiday season

433
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,550
somebody is putting those products

434
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:40,068
together around the 1st of April we

435
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:42,498
start and they'll be continuing through

436
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:44,328
April 20th then on for 21 they have to

437
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:46,639
start doing it all over to restock the

438
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:48,828
shelves because we wipe it clean on 4/20

439
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,389
so it is it's great don't get me wrong

440
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,799
it's great for the industry but for the

441
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,159
people who are part of it it is a

442
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,169
headache

443
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,240
it is like the Christmas rush for the

444
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,068
weed industry it is like the mall at

445
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,899
Christmastime it is like whatever

446
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:01,370
wherever you go to buy fancy [ __ ] it's

447
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,379
like Best Buy it's like the mall it's

448
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,789
like Guitar Center at Christmastime it

449
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,379
is hectic the people that are working

450
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,879
there have that deer-in-the-headlights

451
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,558
sort of look they just wish they could

452
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,019
get a break so they could go smoke it is

453
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:14,240
hectic the traffic starts about two

454
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,549
weeks before everything starts going on

455
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,948
sale the prices change new customers

456
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:21,498
start coming everything is more chaotic

457
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:23,568
so it kind of changes your whole opinion

458
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,550
oh also a lot of times as it gets closer

459
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:26,748
to 4/20 there will be a [ __ ] DJ at

460
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,278
your work DJing

461
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,649
spin in terrible music that you're

462
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,299
trying to work over so you got while

463
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,528
you're trying to sell a gram to some guy

464
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,659
from Texas that doesn't know anything

465
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:37,519
about cannabis I know what I'm talking

466
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,808
about how terrible it is but once you've

467
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,539
done it a couple of years in a row you

468
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:44,000
kind of you think oh god it's 4:15 I

469
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,230
don't want to go to work this week so

470
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,159
that's what it's like once you enter the

471
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,079
cannabis and is

472
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,189
if you work in the retail side you kind

473
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,078
of just want to punch yourself in the

474
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,680
face from about April 10th right in

475
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:56,838
through about April 22nd then I've kind

476
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,219
of shifted my position in the cannabis

477
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,990
industry I still work with a lot of

478
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,759
growers I still do a lot of things in

479
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,680
the cannabis industry I'm not so

480
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,360
involved in that retail side I'm not so

481
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,609
involved in immersed in all the people

482
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,528
I'm kind of more I've become sort of a

483
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,449
hermit in my old age which is [ __ ]

484
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:13,490
great with me the less people the less

485
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:15,799
places the less drama and [ __ ] let's

486
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,810
stick to the point I've kind of changed

487
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,399
my stance since I am not so heavily

488
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,750
involved I don't have to be anywhere

489
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,289
that I don't really want to be at this

490
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,970
point 4:20 now I miss what it used to be

491
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,649
I miss when me and my Bros could nudge

492
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,060
each other and go down for a little 4/20

493
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,769
like I don't got any weed but I got some

494
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:32,328
weed and [ __ ] let's go do some 4/20

495
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,278
or one of your friends who just oh

496
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:35,448
remember the pagers back in the day your

497
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,889
pager would go off and it would have

498
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,659
your friend's phone number and then it

499
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:40,399
would just say 4/20 and then it would

500
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:41,838
have like a couple of other numbers and

501
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,339
we knew that if you put these four

502
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,510
numbers that was the Burger King over on

503
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,130
the south side cuz those are the four

504
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,528
numbers for the pay phone and the Burger

505
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,269
King so if you text me you say 420 the

506
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:51,379
last four digits of the phone number the

507
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,970
pay phone at the Burger King I know

508
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,198
we're gonna go smoke some balls in the

509
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,449
parking lot at Burger King

510
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,578
pretty soon I'll meet you there I missed

511
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:01,309
those days that was kind of cool being a

512
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:03,349
sneaky stoner was fun now that it's not

513
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,698
even I don't know everybody just smoking

514
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,890
weed everywhere it's not even like

515
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,329
sneaky anymore something I don't know

516
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,799
something about hiding it made it a

517
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:12,109
little bit more fun and I missed that

518
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,369
code and that time maybe I just missed

519
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,019
that time period because we were [ __ ]

520
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,239
17 I didn't have to worry about anything

521
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,548
but I missed that part of it

522
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,109
so now being the opposite end of that

523
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:23,088
being an adult where I don't have to

524
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:26,359
hide 420 from anybody at this point the

525
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:28,490
law my parents the teacher nobody cares

526
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,719
you can smoke a fat dad and walk into

527
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,009
class and as long as you can stare at

528
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,179
the teacher properly they don't give a

529
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,640
[ __ ] as long as you paid your tuition

530
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,230
and you showed up nobody even cares so

531
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,360
it's completely different it's a little

532
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,339
it's like when your favorite band puts

533
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,779
out that album and you go ah yeah

534
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,369
probably not gonna listen to them so

535
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,379
much anymore it's kind of that same

536
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,689
feeling for 4/20 don't get me wrong I

537
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,610
love 4/20 I'm smoking down it's for 19

538
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,529
and my eyes are red I'm a little goofy

539
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,139
we're gonna have a great 4/20 but it is

540
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,359
different now I'm an old guy

541
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,799
I'm not into I don't need the code I

542
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,569
don't need that stuff so it's fun to go

543
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:02,029
to the shows it is great to smoke

544
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:03,919
I love the communal feeling of it it is

545
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:06,500
a little overhyped in Colorado because

546
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,050
it is almost like they know all of the

547
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,029
businesses know it's 4:20 time there is

548
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,639
a burger joint that is selling a burger

549
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:17,299
with CBD and the sauce everybody is

550
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,100
advertising blatant 4/20 advertising any

551
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,169
product that could be used by a cannabis

552
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,629
consumer they're pointing it at you with

553
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,970
some 420 style advertising in Colorado

554
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,010
so it's a little overdone in my opinion

555
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,329
but I still love it don't get me wrong I

556
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,190
still love it I want to smoke with you

557
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:34,549
every day at four-twenty and especially

558
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,049
even harder on 4/20 so I love 4/20 I'm

559
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,759
all about the 4/20 I used to have a

560
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,740
shirt that looked like it had the 7/11

561
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,059
logo on it but it actually said four or

562
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,650
add the number four and said twenty on

563
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,359
the bottom of it and it real big on the

564
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,190
back everywhere I went all the hippies

565
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,509
love that [ __ ] like deliver 4/20 shirt

566
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,039
bro and then we would smoke together

567
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,569
then in the future

568
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,279
i evolved i got the one it looked like

569
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:55,460
it's at 7-eleven but it actually said

570
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,629
7/10 because 7/10 is the new 4/20 we got

571
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,360
a couple of months so we talked about

572
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,580
that so that is in a nutshell my

573
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,079
feelings about 4:20 and what 4/20 means

574
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:05,299
to me I appreciate all of your

575
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,399

576
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,899
messages your YouTube comments anyway

577

you reached out thank you for telling me

578
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,580
what 4/20 means to you I've got a couple

579
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,960
of audio clips I'm going to play from

580
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:17,299
friends of ours they want to tell us

581
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,180
what 4/20 means to them before we get

582
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:22,399
there let's go old-school let's talk

583
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,810
about war 4/20 originated we've all got

584
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,210
our own ideas it all means something

585
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,809
cool to all of us let's talk about the

586
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,850
originators of 4/20 in the early 70s in

587
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,250
San Rafael California there were a group

588
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:36,049
of dudes who call themselves the Waldos

589
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,109
you may have heard of these dudes just a

590
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:41,059
normal group of dudes everyday at 4:20

591
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,309
this group of dudes known as the Waldos

592
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,230
would meet up at a spot after school and

593
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,809
guess what they would do they would get

594
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,610
down on a fat joint or a fat bull it

595
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,139
just happened to be 4/20 cuz that's when

596
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:53,059
everybody got out of class that's when

597
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,680
they could all get together so their

598
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,079
code was hey you want to get together

599
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,150
for a little 4/20 and from there it

600
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,859
really caught on now the Waldos were

601
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,230
also known for being dead heads

602
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:04,969
so the phrase 4/20 travelled quickly

603
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,490
through deadhead culture deadheads loved

604
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,019
to have some sort of a cool catchphrase

605
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,549
anything to say something without saying

606
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,889
the real word and dead head culture is

607
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,369
always a really catchy thing to do so

608
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,630
it's

609
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,419
spread like wildfire through the

610
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,610
deadhead culture in the 80s deadhead

611
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,500
cultures started becoming like pop

612
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,569
culture it was just becoming mainstream

613
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,400
so that introduced 4/20 to the

614
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,629
mainstream which made it spread through

615
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,370
the high school kids where it became

616
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,620
even more popular that's where I

617
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:32,839
discovered it I discovered it in high

618
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,089
school and through the fish community at

619
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,649
fish shows when I said 420 at a fish

620
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:39,139
show everybody definitely knew what I

621
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,370
meant so big shout out to the Waldos I

622
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,800
don't want to blow all of their story

623
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,259
they've got a website and their website

624
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,909
is 420 Waldo's dot-com if you were more

625
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,230
interested in the Waldos I encourage you

626
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,179
to check out their website it is kind of

627
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,759
neat it is kind of fun there's a lot of

628
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:55,160
archival evidence they can show how far

629
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,390
back the phrase 4:20 went they show how

630
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,460
far back they've been calling themselves

631
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,440
the Waldos then they show how they link

632
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,670
themselves to the Grateful Dead so it is

633
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,190
a really fun website if you're

634
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,380
interested in the 420 culture so I've

635
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,299
told you what 420 means to me we have

636
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,910
talked about what 420 means to a lot of

637
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:13,308
our listeners I have educated you on

638
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,380
where 420 came from now I think it is

639
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:18,710
time to play some clips from some of our

640
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,360
friends about 420 all right first off

641
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,880
happy 4/20 Mike thanks for joining me

642
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,329
yeah man so uh I am asking everybody

643
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,890
what is 4/20 mean to you you like myself

644
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:29,210
have been in and out of the cannabis

645
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,730
industry you've been around for quite a

646
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,319
while also you're an old dude so can you

647
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,160
tell me what does 4/20 mean to you um

648
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,839
it's a big it's the community holiday it

649
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,620
when I was younger I went kind of wild

650
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,269
with it but that was in the heyday where

651
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:48,319
tens of thousands of people would gather

652
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:52,400
up at cu-boulder

653
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,419
on Norlin lawn or one hundreds of

654
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,070
thousands of people or a hundred

655
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,190
thousand people would gather in downtown

656
00:21:55,069 --> 00:22:01,730
Denver at Civic Center no concerts no

657
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:05,029
promotion of food vending just a giant

658
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,549
massive smoke out in the battled

659
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:10,009
prohibition days because we could in

660
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,779
mass numbers sort of a civil protest if

661
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:13,400
you will it was the only real act of

662
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:17,269
civil disobedience I got to participate

663
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,090
in in my generation still a great rite

664
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,889
of passage I was also like I vividly

665
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,139
remember the first time I went up to see

666
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,149
you Boulder and participated in the

667
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,028
smoke out on 4/20

668
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:31,218
it was insane just like people

669
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:33,528
everywhere cops everywhere people with

670
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:35,599
cameras everywhere the school really

671
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:38,118
didn't want the event to take place but

672
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:40,009
there's there's nothing you can do when

673
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:42,138
10,000 or more people decide that

674
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:43,969
they're gonna show up it a place at a

675
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:45,798
time and do a thing absolutely

676
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:48,949
how are in numbers how old were you at

677
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:53,658
that time mmm I think the first time I

678
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:57,409
went up there I was 18 cool I mean there

679
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:58,339
was like in 2000 when these there was no

680
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,979
medical yet

681
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:02,269
Callie been medical in Colorado would

682
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:06,979
just pass medical but it didn't mean

683
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:10,009
anything there were no doctors no cards

684
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:11,719
no meed no medical marijuana program yet

685
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,459
so everything was black market

686
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:15,199
everything was illegal basically unless

687
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,489
you were one of those rare med patients

688
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:19,068
that we had here but that was brand-new

689
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:22,369
so many there there were almost no

690
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:27,108
medical patients in like the early 2000s

691
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:29,298
mm 1 2 3 4 so you 18 and that's what 420

692
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:31,938
was for you then who sort of a a holiday

693
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:35,328
a cultural holiday and also a great day

694
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:37,819
that was it was a mass protest the

695
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:40,578
beautiful thing about those events in

696
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:42,828
their original incarnation was all of

697
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:45,769
these people would show up they would

698
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:48,408
commit what was considered a serious

699
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,388
crime together smoking pot in public was

700
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:54,949
not something that didn't get you

701
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:56,928
handcuffed and dragged off a lot of

702
00:23:54,949 --> 00:24:00,349
places take it for granted but it's not

703
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,749
like that still but at the time it was I

704
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:05,058
mean it was a serious crime and it was

705
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:08,739
sort of absurd that this was a crime and

706
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:11,388
so having all this people come together

707
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:13,608
hang out for a couple hours in the

708
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:19,458
afternoon like it's usually half decent

709
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:20,989
on 4/20 sometimes it's brutal cold lucky

710
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,548
this year it's gonna be beautiful god I

711
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:25,278
hope so it's been beautiful last couple

712
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:27,078
days but the first couple times I went

713
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,199
up to 420 it was gorgeous the weather

714
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:33,739
was nice it was just astounding to see

715
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:37,278
all those people gather hang out chill

716
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:38,490
until like 4:18 and then the whole crowd

717
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,460
kind of stands up

718
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,720
starts Chernin Hooten red at 420

719
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,110
everybody lights up and there's just

720
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,660
this massive cloud and then by five

721
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:51,149
o'clock everybody's gone and there's

722
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,900
like fifteen little groups of ones and

723
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,910
twos walking around picking up trash um

724
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,009
and there's there's no traffic snarls

725
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,769
there's no bodies on the highway there's

726
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:04,049
no pandemonium later um it was just an

727
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:05,369
awesome act of civil disobedience and

728
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,619
then when I went down to Civic Center

729
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:09,689
the next couple of years was I used to

730
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,089
go every year we'd take the the light

731
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:17,009
rail into downtown and just watch the

732
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:18,419
show all afternoon but seeing a hundred

733
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,980
thousand people all light up right in

734
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,570
front of the state capitol is something

735
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,900
that you should definitely see in person

736
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:28,409
if you haven't seen it but I stopped

737
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,980
going the more corporate it got when

738
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:34,890
there was a promoter and concerts and a

739
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,360
couple of terrible vending attempts it

740
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,750
just

741
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:41,250
it lost its pre allure is blasted soap

742
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,250
for me that makes a lot of sense

743
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,630
I I see how it has gone from I'm gonna

744
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,039
talk about this when I say what it means

745
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,900
to me I don't want to step on your your

746
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,609
part here but I see how it has

747
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,230
definitely gone from the thing that was

748
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:53,849
what the bros did it was kind of a

749
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,429
download thing the potheads were doing

750
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:58,289
it and now 420 is an event we go rent

751
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,840
space and we say hey city we're going to

752
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,220
hold a 4/20 rally so it is definitely

753
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,069
evolved I see how you're talking about

754
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,049
corporate so Mike did working in the

755
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:10,169
cannabis industry change your outlook in

756
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:12,329
your opinion on 4/20 if you work in the

757
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,120
industry especially on the retail side

758
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,970
for 20s just a nightmare it's like

759
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,369
working Christmas if you're if you've

760
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,370
worked regular retail right it's it's

761
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:26,009
pandemonium just endless lines whatever

762
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:28,379
sales going on dude that the whole week

763
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,609
leading up is just not two weeks this

764
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,380
year it seems like it's been two weeks

765
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:33,000
ahead it's like every holiday is getting

766
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,400
drugged further and further down yeah

767
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,500
yeah it is added to be at the list of

768
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,000
holidays in most states they don't get

769
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,549
the extra holiday that we get here we

770
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,410
have sales like every store has a sale

771
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,139
right around 4:20 any story that could

772
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,610
apply the gross store the restaurants

773
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,110
like the restaurants where stoners go

774
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,909
the pizza joints all those places are

775
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,319
having a sale right now they may not

776
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,389
blatantly say

777
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,759
420 sale but we all know all the

778
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:58,740
advertising is green it all it's all the

779
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,509
week before and after 420 we all know

780
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,490
what it is it's really neat to see that

781
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:05,669
all the mainstream culture is kind of

782
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,769
catching on it the disappointing example

783
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:10,259
of that that I just saw was Carl's jr.

784
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,638
CBD sauce on one of their burgers I was

785
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:12,778
like you know your [ __ ] family life

786
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:15,058
right now I don't know if that's even

787
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:17,519
real is that real it's 100% real there's

788
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:19,528
one location in Denver in four four

789
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,460
twenty four $4.20

790
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:25,349
on 4/20 you can get one of their burgers

791
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,169
in in their secret sauce they're

792
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:29,849
infusing [ __ ] CBD for that one burger

793
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:31,259
I want to get one of these burgers and

794
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,000
take it to a lap and have it test it and

795
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,038
see how much CBD is in this burger I'm

796
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,509
just curious

797
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,798
interesting game right just Carol

798
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:40,110
they're advertising and it's got to be

799
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,378
in there CBDs everywhere no it's it's

800
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:46,109
the next big pile on it is

801
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:48,509
I saw a meme on social media that said

802
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:51,028
folks in Colorado be like my Subaru runs

803
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,409
on CBD and is absolutely [ __ ]

804
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:54,000
accurate alright Mike we are all

805
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:55,500
stepping all over your little segment

806
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,909
here in this show I just wanted to give

807
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,970
you a couple of brief moments to tell us

808
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,860
what 4/20 means to you you talked about

809
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,480
it as you were a youngster as you

810
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,849
started off in your activism you went to

811
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,710
a peaceful civil disobedience kind of a

812
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,079
protest many of them I've got some good

813
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,509
old footage used to stand in the crowd

814
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,099
and do the slowly turn in a story or at

815
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:16,048
all I like to do that to be a tall guy

816
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:17,459
that's a fun one so then it became kind

817
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,109
of commercialized you quit going to the

818
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,028
events and for a couple of years like

819
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:23,250
myself you were tied up at a location

820
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:24,659
either working retail during a couple of

821
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,388
the years you were working at the grow

822
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,889
with me offer at least one 4/20 now that

823
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:30,750
your time to older dude you're a parent

824
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:33,750
I you're not really in the industry per

825
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:37,079
se but you are still on the fringe what

826
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,159
is the word I'm looking for tertiary you

827
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,599
were kind of in the industry you're

828
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,970
right near it you're on the your

829
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,908
industry adjacent how does 4/20 what is

830
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,450
4/20 mean to you these days honestly

831
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:51,480
it's it's just another day in my book I

832
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,058
don't have any plans to hit up a big

833
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,970
event or to go up to Civic Center or

834
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:58,829
anything that nonsense just just way too

835
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,350
much at this point if the kids are

836
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:03,599
chillin at 4:20 you might run to the dad

837
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:06,449
safe room and take a quick puff at 4:20

838
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,609
yeah then it

839
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,620
it's not like I'm missing the the

840
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,969
tradition of like a family dinner or

841
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,559
something like that with a lot of other

842
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,390
holidays where it's like if I just stop

843
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,149
doing Thanksgiving like there are other

844
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,670
parts than just stuff about the holiday

845
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,500
that I would miss with 4/20 it's it's

846
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:26,039
just another day in my book

847
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,569
but it gets funded the community has a

848
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,480
date to focus on and kind of go all out

849
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:34,659
with but most of the stuff I see now I

850
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,549
just shake my head at all right Mike man

851
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,040
that was a great kind of overview of

852
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:41,019
your beginning of 4/20 in the middle of

853
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,269
4/20 your retail 420 and now the

854
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:46,779
definitely old man Mike 4/20 good

855
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:50,019
perspective there it like it's it's a

856
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:52,029
holiday on the day it's a time code it's

857
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:54,190
a number like when I was in high school

858
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:59,109
it was cute to like write 420 in your

859
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:00,880
notebook and [ __ ] but since I was 15 it

860
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:03,879
was as good as wearing a shirt that said

861
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,740
pothead absolutely no one was confused

862
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,750
about the number 420 except the most

863
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,079
ignorant among us just the nerds and

864
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,460
they were confused about everything so

865
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,129
all right Mike thank you for joining me

866

869
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,789

say what 4/20 means to us I'll go first

879
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,569
4/20 to me is a day where people get

880
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,450
together to celebrate the magical herb

881
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:54,609
it's a peaceful day I'd say it's a day

882
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,920
of peace around all the world where

883
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:59,409
people can relax and fire up enjoy

884
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,269
however they prefer or as edible or if

885
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,519
it's a smoke or even if it's without any

886
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:05,170
ganja just to feel the vibes of 4/20

887
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,609
that's what 4/20 means to me

888
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:12,279
for me Pato Banton 4/20 is something

889
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,119
that happens twice everyday once in the

890
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:19,329
evening 4:20 and once in a month at 4:20

891
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,428
and every year annually 4/20 is when the

892
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:24,069
whole world come together to celebrate

893
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:26,080
the healing of the nation and to remind

894
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:27,819
each other that we should take away the

895
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,369
stigma from this beautiful plant and

896
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:32,439
remember that it is a medicine it's a

897
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:34,239
natural herb and there's nothing wrong

898
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:42,340
with partaking of this beautiful

899
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:44,200
medication peace yes pick up yes all
