been going on we had an election last

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:23,088
night on the ballots but we did have

194
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,939
number 105 regarding non GMO food this

195
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:29,360
was the labeling of GMO foods Colorado

196
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:32,360
dude you failed bro what the hell this

197
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,598
was supposed to pass this was what this

198
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,889
was

199
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,509
we're not gonna get too much into it

200
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,699
because it's already happened this was

201
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,829
we wanted them to have to mark

202
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,329
genetically modified food products with

203
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:47,509
some sort of indication that it is

204
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:53,389
genetically modified what the hell is

205
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:55,610
going on Colorado that's really

206
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,079
disappointing I like Jesse brought a

207
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,610
really good Facebook post he said

208
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,019
something to the effect of that's okay

209
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,139
Colorado I didn't want to share my

210
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:05,329
organic produce with you anyway Jesse's

211
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,829
tomatoes are delicious I am addicted

212
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:09,050
there's only one other place I've eaten

213
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:11,060
recently that's got Tomatoes nearly as

214
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,389
tasty as Jesse's I know where that place

215
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,769
is

216
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,538
do they get so many shout outs on this

217
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,689
podcast I'm addicted to that place I eat

218
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:20,550
there a lot we went up there with burnt

219
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:24,269
and first cousins and

220
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,680
they made customers made friends yeah

221
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,448
you like your family when you're they

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:34,320
know my name by now they start writing

223
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:37,680
down my order when they see it's uh I've

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,649
never seen that many madhe uh different

225
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,658
drinks yeah yeah like I was a little

226
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,099
overwhelmed at first it's a little

227
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,778
strange the first time you walk you will

228
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,220
the the vibe there is very unique so

229
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,500
when you walk in you're almost in a new

230
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,190
world turn your cell phone off when you

231
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,799
go in there please

232
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,410
I agree but there are so many people in

233
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,879
there I go I've gone late at night and

234
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,129
midday and if you go during the day it's

235
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,838
like it's 20-somethings with their mac

236
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:08,009
books and their iPhones all over the

237
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:10,980
place you're 12 there were some people

238
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,509
playing chess and a couple people who

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,459
look like they're on a date or so it's

240
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,809
just real to another guys playing chess

241
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:21,359
and their look like robots the one guy I

242
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,609
guess where he was playing chess with

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:32,278
the guy in front of them and then he was

244
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:34,050
also playing it on his iPad I've got a

245
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,000
funny joke that only a few listeners are

246
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:37,289
gonna get we were at it's we're talking

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,700
about a place called the mante factor

248
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:41,458
and they make your Beaumont a it's a

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,170
Brazilian energizing tea they have two

250
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,269
different kinds they have the dark your

251
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:47,189
Beaumont a which is what I prefer and

252
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,338
then they have got the green your

253
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,290
Beaumont a which I prefer the green iced

254
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,579
and I like the dark ha that's just my

255
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,449
preference so if I need a cool drink

256
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:56,609
I'll get the green one

257
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,579
the guy was describing the differences

258
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,899
to a customer it's in a really touristy

259
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:02,519
area so you get a lot of touristy kind

260
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,559
of people that are describing this drink

261
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,659
to a tourist and he said that the dark

262
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,250
roast is the dried leaves that have been

263
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,659
sat out and they've dried and they

264
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,458
crumble it and then they brew it or they

265
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,588
grind it then they brew it together and

266
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,419
he said the green is more the fresh leaf

267
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,670
that hasn't been dried and set out for

268
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,899
as long and I heard him say that and I

269
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:22,519
looked at the girl that was with me and

270
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,519
I said he's talking about that live red

271
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,830
[Music]

272
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,420
that's exactly the description that

273
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,180
worked perfectly it's all about that

274
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,339
live resin dark roast is the dragon

275
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,849
cured and then fresh green as the live

276
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,730
rays and you can taste the difference

277
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,500
I had only ever had the green before I

278
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,580
went up there and I got the dark I was

279
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,960
like yeah this is gonna happen but if

280
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,600
anybody that listens to this podcast

281
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,730

the iGrow culture podcast and they told

285
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,809

free muffin that's a lot of talk about

293
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,240
the monta factor the place is so good

294
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,220
bro if you go up there go hike on

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,750
Rainbow Falls I never said nothing about

296
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,160
the secret Rainbow Falls that place is

297
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,009
awesome if you can find it go hike it

298
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,669
it's cool graffiti Falls so we're

299
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:33,120
talking about the the votes that

300
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:35,009
happened last night Oregon Alaska and

301
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,860
Washington DC have legalized

302
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:40,559
recreational cannabis welcome to the

303
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,580
cool kid Club yeah for it on the other

304
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,399
hand you're just old people in

305
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,490
Disneyworld still how many people in

306
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,949
Florida do you think could actually

307
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,480
reduce their like their their pain

308
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,610
medication consumption drastically maybe

309
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,039
some of those pain companies the pain

310
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,169
clinics kind of lobbied against all of

311
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,349
this medical cannabis or cannabis no

312
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:09,000
surely not I mean I would think a big

313
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,370
major corporation would have a lot more

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,019
integrity not good honest company yeah

315
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:18,750
something like that because that would

316
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:22,590
be kind of cheating and citizens come on

317
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,090
big pharma yeah yeah so if you uh if you

318
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,410
did not go out and vote you can't [ __ ]

319
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,389

326
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:43,360
reason they're listening to this and

327
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,360

328
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,970

329
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,230
for me and we're gonna discontinue that

330
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,850
actually we're gonna stop building

331
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,080
because I haven't said that in quite a

332
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,580
long time on the show so it's kind of

333
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,530
cool somebody let me know what I owe and

334
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,639
I'll pay it I had you on two for one

335
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:09,350
episode yeah but I don't remember which

336
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,059
one or when or where anything so

337
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,259
dreadful J where are you girl he always

338
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:16,729
listen to the show and remind me of

339
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:19,789
funny stuff that I said so gonna say

340
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,269
Washington DC our nation's capital now

341
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:24,439
has legalized cannabis why doesn't the

342
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,269
rest of the nation

343
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,590
just follow suit with what the Capitol

344
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:35,240
is done yeah I guess there are

345
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:37,820
intelligent people in DC change some of

346
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,200
the their habits like while they're up

347
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,870
there doing what they do instead of just

348
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:52,280
droning on the bill Akhil bro I think

349
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:55,370
that these GMOs work Rakesh this just

350
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:58,990
made uh getting a spoken adjoint from

351
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,399
the White House photo up a lot easier

352
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,049
well that's uh there was actually I was

353
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,179
at Garden of the Gods and I think I saw

354
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,740
a sign that remind you reminded you that

355
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,709
that's a state park and you cannot bring

356
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,509
your cannabis there yeah because it's

357
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,009
still federal land so I'm pretty sure

358
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,269
that that White House land is federal

359
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,539
land and you can't have your cannabis

360
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,909
there

361
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,199
good point yeah if you uh if you go to a

362
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,549
state park right now in Colorado people

363
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,560
that are not from Colorado this is a

364
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:25,229
random did not prepare this part at all

365
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,019
if you're not if you were in a state

366
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:32,490
park in Colorado like Red Rocks is a

367
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:37,949
state park most the reservoirs like the

368
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:53,789
reservoir reservoir hangout you cannot

369
00:14:37,950 --> 00:15:18,240
you can so even if it's gonna be a

370
00:14:53,789 --> 00:15:20,099
little sketchy White House does that

371
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,409
kind of make you feel cold I wasn't

372
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,040
gonna go there I did come across my mind

373
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:26,969
but all right we've been talking about

374
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,009
Jesse now we're talking about building a

375
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,120
room a couple episodes back and we're

376
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,429
talking about planning your grow room we

377
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,710
talked about selecting your space being

378
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,879
responsible grower on this episode we're

379
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,620
to talk more about building and setting

380
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,269
up your grow we're gonna discuss grow

381
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,279
tents a little bit or those hydro huts

382
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,019
or whatever you want to call and maybe

383
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,519
if we have enough time we're already 15

384
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,610
minutes in if we have enough time I will

385
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,169
try to tackle that $500 grow room

386
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,950
question that's gonna be a challenge but

387
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:55,409
basically do everything that we're doing

388
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,970
I go much smaller if we don't even get

389
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,230
two pots and soil and stuff on the stuff

390
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,330
that I've got written and we've got five

391
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,899
pages of stuff typed out so this is

392
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,420
gonna be a lot we wrapped up the last

393
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,829
grubka soda with the talk about deciding

394
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:09,689
how much light to use in your space and

395
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,950
we kind of talked about where you're

396
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,410
gonna hang the lights and where you're

397
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,960
gonna life phone is making noise that's

398
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:18,969
a poor podcast move right there oh sorry

399
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,990
No yeah it was on silent I don't know

400
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,160
what that was yeah talk about we're

401
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,120
gonna hang glide so you're gonna fit the

402
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,519
humidity was talking a little bit about

403
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,049
bringing fresh air into the room so now

404
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,699
let's kind of talk about building a room

405
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:33,459
which is kind of helpful because jesse

406
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,780
has a lot of experience in this now you

407
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,250
need to make a clean gross space that

408
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:38,350
allows you to control the light cycles

409
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,519
the temperature during the day the

410
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,470
temperature during the night and you

411
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,539
need to control the humidity and it's

412
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,190
also ideal to have a lot of control over

413
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:47,049
the air going in and out of the gross

414
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,060
space if you're using an extra bedroom

415
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,409
or a closet you'll have all the walls

416
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,419
already built but you'll need to work

417
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,620
around the existing room jesse was

418
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,599
talking about working at a brick

419
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,190
building or a brick facility I don't

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,960
know where it is I didn't ask I don't

421
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,120
want to know but he was talking about

422
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,440
150 years old that's brick that's gotta

423
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,930
suck because you don't everything to

424
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,640
screw [ __ ] into bricks crumble if you

425
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,709
hit them with a hammer and try to put

426
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,290
nails into him she can go really wrong

427
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,000
if you move one brick now you've got an

428
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:16,299
unstable wall all right so I'm ranting

429
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,130
about a brick if you've got a garage or

430
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,838
a basement or maybe Jesse's brick area

431
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,339
you're gonna need to build a room you

432
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,139
can't you could just hang lights up in

433
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:24,490
your garage or in that basement it's

434
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,680
gonna be a lot easier if you build a

435
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,960
room or set up a free prefabricated grow

436
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,180
Hut because I just gives you actually

437
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,400
control over your environment and an

438
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,380
environment simple reflection and

439
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,259
trapping the light and having it reflect

440
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,850
around makes the light up to 30% more

441
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:42,430
efficient is what I read in a couple of

442
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:44,409
books one set 21 said 30 how about we'll

443
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,789
settle on 25 percent more efficient and

444
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,200
if you're running a thousand watt light

445
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:52,149
that's 250 Watts basically of efficiency

446
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,740
that you're going to not lose by having

447
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,470
more reflection so just putting in a

448
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,120
good designed room is already saving you

449
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,890
money and increasing buds because like

450
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,019
we talked about on another show the

451
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,450
light is the main nutrient for your

452
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,710
plants it's not what you pour in it's

453
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,340
not what you feed it it's actually the

454
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,559
light so where are we let's uh let's

455
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,149
actually get into building a room I was

456
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,289
looking at all kinds of stuff and trying

457
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,540
to figure out how to do this I just

458
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:19,389
decided what's gonna build a four light

459
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,730
room we're gonna act like we're building

460
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,380
it either in a garage that's got plenty

461
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,569
of room or the basement that's got

462
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,750
plenty of room

463
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,730
or maybe in a warehouse sorry about the

464
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,950
cops guys we've been taking dad's so

465
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,490
let's build a room we need for 1,000

466
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,930
watt lights an air conditioner a way to

467
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,779
remove the humidity and a way to draw in

468
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,580
fresh air so let's choose like I said

469
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,839
we're gonna do the basement or a garage

470
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:49,379
or something like that that we want to

471
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:51,480
build a floor light room because

472
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,340
two-by-fours come in eight foot sections

473
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,319
right two by three or whatever we

474
00:18:53,339 --> 00:19:03,569
decided to use a 2x4 you can get them

475
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:05,669
into you can buy a bunch of 8 by 8 bunch

476
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:09,689
a foot two by fours and I think you

477
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,850
could set up this room in a day you and

478
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,580
I could do it in five hours because

479
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,079
we've done this enough times so you're

480
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,569
gonna use a girl Hut or something or a

481
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,619
pre-made grow lab what do you guys do

482
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:24,509
you guys know girl huts at the height

483
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:26,899
over it hydro indoor growing supplies we

484
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:30,539
have a generic brand is it the grow lab

485
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,380
and we have a girl okay the generic

486
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:36,450
brand is different than the Chrome apps

487
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,100
I've never seen one but we can get a

488
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,080
really good price on them all right

489
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:43,409
and they're just basic you know I use

490
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,119
the grow labs that's what I live one 20s

491
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,009
or something like that or the class of

492
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,750
fives yeah those are sweeps same thing

493
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,190
so a thousand watt light in there and

494
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,849
those are awesome they also make it ten

495
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,930
by ten one which would work perfectly

496
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,969
for what we're gonna talk about here

497
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,370
would be we're gonna basically build an

498
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,140
8x8 version of that ten by six ten by

499
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:03,209
ten feet by ten feet by six eye I think

500
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,880
or seven hi we're just gonna make an 8

501
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,579
by 8 by 8 room one of the best ways to

502
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,620
build a room you know even like a big

503
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,990
huge warehouse what they do is

504
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:16,709
essentially they build a gigantic grow

505
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,079
out of two by fours and you know try

506
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,870
wall and everything they'll build a room

507
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:25,199
inside of her groom even in like the

508
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,969
vertical commercial lettuce forms and

509
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,380
stuff like that that's they start with

510
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:33,250
these cells so I know

511
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:49,870
um he needs it you know sometimes

512
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:51,880
looking at a ten-by-ten girl i've got

513
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:53,619
basic skills but for me buying the ten

514
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,140
by ten Hut and snapping those pieces

515
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,489
together is so much easier for me and if

516
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,830
something were to go wrong in or grow

517
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,170
the thing comes down in an hour you

518
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:05,679
could have everything down concealed in

519
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,900
one hour put it back up hopefully at

520
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,090
another hour with those girl huts and if

521
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,690
you're like working in a garage or a big

522
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:15,009
open basement I mean you know it's just

523
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,779
if you want to expand and stuff like

524
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,910
that there there's a lot of good reasons

525
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:21,670
to have multiple rooms when it comes to

526
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,990
pest control of equipment failure and

527
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:30,910
all kinds of stuff like that you know

528
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:32,259
it's good to double up like you said if

529
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,060
the air conditioner fails in this room

530
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,799
it didn't fail in every room it only

531
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,169
failed in one light or four lights worth

532
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,169
of stuff he only murdered 30 plants

533
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,720
instead of 100 I'm glad you said that

534
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,070
part about building a room within a room

535
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,990
comes in handy sometimes because most of

536
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,490
what I wrote was about building a room

537
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,890
inside of a room is gonna say frame out

538
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,450
of 8x8 room that's nice and tall I was

539
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,860
gonna say try to leave as much Headroom

540
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,120
as you can but most of us are gonna be

541
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:57,309
in a basement or garage so we'll be

542
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,799
limited on space and then I said if you

543
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:01,029
can use the full eight foot two by fours

544
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,319
you're in good luck so frame out your 8

545
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,990
by 8 by 8 room wherever you're working

546
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,700
and then here's where I kind of start

547
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,559
getting into detail since Jesse kind of

548
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:15,370
I'm so glad you said build a room inside

549
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:16,629
of a room even like big like restaurants

550
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:20,849
and old buildings and stuff like that

551
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,850
that's how they you know it's sanitary

552
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,650
alright so over frame yourself a nice

553
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:28,210
room alright you're gonna buy a room

554
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,670
just framed you don't need to frame it

555
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,460
like super rigidly secure you just need

556
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,600
a couple of cross beams yeah I'm 24 inch

557
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:42,400
studs every 24 inches so I stand every

558
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:45,099
24 inches every 24 inches plan for a

559
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:54,670
door sometimes you guys forget doors the

560
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:59,019
hydro shop sell the poly were to talk

561
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,340
about later use a razor you just follow

562
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,970
your razor right along with it and cut a

563
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:09,399
hole in the poly door do not unzip it

564
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,660
before you stick it on okay we're just

565
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,780
gonna move on because we don't want to

566
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,190
make fun of your customer that did that

567
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:17,759
to put some beams across the top to hang

568
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:22,090
your equipment you've got this building

569
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,379
just just a frame studs every 24 inches

570
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:27,069
maybe a couple across cuz you're gonna

571
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,740
hang some equipment the roof beams well

572
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:32,259
just any gun if you go all the way to to

573
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,309
the ceiling if you don't go all the way

574
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:38,470
to the ceiling just stand your don't lay

575
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:41,319
them down stand your 2x4 stand up on the

576
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,200
skinny edge gives you some metal clamps

577
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:47,139
and screw them to the top of two walls

578
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,809
and it'll help support the brace

579
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,190
everything you can hang lights from it

580
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,690
all kinds of neat [ __ ] that's why we

581
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,960
brought Jessie it's way easier why

582
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,299
paying the big bucks

583
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,039
everything's framed up you can insulate

584
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,599
the room with the blue insulation boards

585
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,299
if you want to make it more soundproof

586
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,039
and more have more stable temps I don't

587
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,599
find that to be too necessary if you're

588
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,909
in a basement if you're in the garage

589
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,919
maybe is it's gonna get colder in the

590
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,630
winter and hotter in the summer but the

591
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,539
basement like we talked about stays

592
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,950
fairly cool most of the time some people

593
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,720
choose to use plywood or some type of

594
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,519
board on the walls whatever you want is

595
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,750
cool build it how you like at that point

596
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,569
but once you'd be centered on the walls

597
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,720
and insulation that's when we hang we

598
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:30,339
call it poly or Panda film paulie's

599
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,950
basically plastic sheeting that's white

600
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:35,319
on one side and black on the other you

601
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,960
hang the white side on the inside of the

602
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,329
room and the black side on the house

603
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,710
the room it´ll the white will keep the

604
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:42,960
reflection of your light in there and

605
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,880
give you more efficiency you need to

606
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,410
cover up the whole room the walls the

607
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,150
floor and the ceiling and seal it up

608
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,580
with tape seal up any spots where bugs

609
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,320
can get in any spots where light can get

610
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,289
out you want it to be a little fortress

611
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:58,230
that's its own private little room you

612
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:59,879
want to seal that [ __ ] up and the more

613
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,589
time you take in the tighter you get all

614
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,610
the plastic and everything there's less

615
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:07,679
of a spot for bugs to get and stuff like

616
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:10,109
that yes take your time with this take

617
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,730
your time with it if you can if you have

618
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:13,289
a little bit of overlap everywhere there

619
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,240
is some kind of gap that's a good idea

620
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:17,629
when you're putting your staples in put

621
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,890
down a little square of duct tape

622
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,810
yeah because that'll help from the poly

623
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,670
tearing it also keep the stapling a

624
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:26,849
little bit better you can also go back

625
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:33,509
and take a little bit of silicone

626
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:35,129
caulking and stick that right in a

627
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:42,390
little staple had to make sure I got

628
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:44,400
that dealt in there like we were talking

629
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,840
about most of what we're gonna talk

630
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
about now works in the grow huts and it

631
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,079
translates that kind of translates to if

632
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you're just working with the bedroom

633
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,289
also if you haven't built a room the

634
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,119
main difference is you won't have the

635
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,289
buffer zone around the grow area if

636
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,609
you're in a bedroom you'll need to vent

637
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,980
out of the room or the house without

638
00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:00,299
anybody noticing the room that we've

639
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,860
built inside of the rooms give you more

640
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,309
privacy and I feel like a little bit

641
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:08,000
more control should we go over a bedroom

642
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:11,009
how to vent out a window real cheap

643
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,569
snazzy like real quick I think I talked

644
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:16,859
a little bit about it yeah we can talk

645
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:18,389
about it and if when I get to it later

646
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:22,529
on we'll just skip it later okay

647
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,300
so crack your window open half inch it's

648
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:28,399
kind of depends on how much air flow you

649
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:30,869
need through it and then screw it shop

650
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,680
there early screw it to where it can't

651
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:36,869
be opened any further and you do that by

652
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,900
real gently running a nice three inch

653
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,859
screw through the most people have vinyl

654
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,200
windows

655
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,939
through the inside track of where the

656
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,799
window goes up and down that'll hold the

657
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,080
window shut keep someone from wrecking

658
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,869
and open then you take your you went

659
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,289
window blinds get you a nice new set of

660
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:58,719
mini blinds cheap ones throw that down

661
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:02,109
close them so that you know no light can

662
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,690
go through maybe leave them open a

663
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:06,929
quarter-inch at the bottom air will

664
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,509
still suck through a pretty pretty good

665
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:13,330
and then take pan to film put the white

666
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,549
side to the outside of the window staple

667
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:18,759
it over that and take you a piece of

668
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:22,059
plywood screw it up over the wall and

669
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,769
you can cut holes and mount about fans

670
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,289
on there and all your ducting and

671
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:28,150
everything yeah yeah so you can use one

672
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:29,980
window as an intake in one window some

673
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,019
exhaust have you ever done the thing

674
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,430
where you Bob

675
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:36,039
put the blinds up just like you said you

676
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,480
I would close the window or leave it

677
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,559
open just a little bit okay we're gonna

678
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,000
leave it open for what we're doing on

679
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,299
this one sorry too many ideas in my head

680
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,569
you leave the half-inch gap and then you

681
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:48,700
build basically a box around the window

682
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:51,099
so you take some plywood and you make

683
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,779
like three inch deep little square

684
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:54,490
around the like an inch around the

685
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:56,649
window and then you put a piece of

686
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,210
plywood over that and then you can put

687
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,530
all your ducting in that plywood and it

688
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,090
almost looks like you could put like a

689
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,079
Christmas slide or a candle light or

690
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,149
something in there and it looks like

691
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,569
somebody's home all the time

692
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,850
it look like you got a light can

693
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:11,710
actually use that as ducting and [ __ ]

694
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:13,389
too now cuz it's open I did one I

695
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,640
actually stuck a Christmas light in

696
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,810
there yeah a yellow one and it reflected

697
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,140
off the all the plastic and everything

698
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:24,279
enough to you've got a window open and

699
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,360
it looks like somebody's home you got a

700
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,339
light on in there and it looks like it's

701
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,019
just part of the normal yeah so if

702
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:31,759
you're I have no idea why we wouldn't

703
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:34,309
need to be that secretive

704
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,900
you know it's mostly uh I'm not worried

705
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,250
is worried about the police as I am

706
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,440
about the thieves I actually heard a

707
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,789
story about some thieves getting into

708
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
somebody's air they went in through

709
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:45,379
their house through the air conditioning

710
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:48,769
duct their plants while the people were

711
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,450
home well they found out and I shouldn't

712
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,970
even be talking about this because that

713
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,009
whatever but the people found out their

714
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,630
plants were being stolen because of the

715
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:58,160
cops knocked on the door and found kids

716
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,010
running out their backyard with pot

717
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,360
plants oh yeah right I don't know how

718
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:07,220
that story ended I bailed on that

719
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,629
conversation [ __ ] alright so I hope my

720
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,370
story about building the box around the

721
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,660
window makes sense it's I kind of had a

722
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:13,159
vague idea of how to do that in my head

723
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,259
I was thinking too many thoughts so you

724
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,269
take up just shape the size of the

725
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,339
window you add an inch square so now if

726
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:21,680
your window is 24 by 24 to make it 25 by

727
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:23,869
25 square piece of plywood and then you

728
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,310
make a freaking box out of it you know

729
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,659
what I mean like a half box so it's only

730
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,819
you only need it three inches deep make

731
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,980
it a little tray and then put that up

732
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:42,289
against the window and then you can put

733
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:45,519
a curtain let's see where was I on all

734
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:49,339
these papers I hate I hate sloppy

735
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:56,029
windows I've actually seen a few houses

736
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:58,639
around town drive around you I can drive

737
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:59,869
to right now cross yeah right there you

738
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,480
can always see the metal halide in the

739
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:07,129
Attic so hang that Poli real carefully

740
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,049
like Jesse said take your time with the

741
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,850
poly here this is the building of the

742
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:12,500
room these are your walls you wouldn't

743
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:15,709
build your house walls all shitty you

744
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,240
want your plant room nice cover the

745
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,440
whole room seal it up seal any spots

746
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,809
where [ __ ] can get in now he basically

747
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,830
you got that little girl huh we're

748
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,000
talking about a bedroom I think I

749
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:26,089
already did most of the part I'm talking

750
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,680
about more privacy now you got the room

751
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,089
built and sealed up you're gonna use a

752
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,900
bedroom make sure to clean and dust the

753
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,449
bedroom first

754
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,850
keep on liner oh yeah that's definitely

755
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,740
on my list [ __ ] cover the windows where

756
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:38,240
the light can get in or get out cover

757
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,640
any cracks if you got cracks in the

758
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,440
walls cover those cover all your walls

759
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,259
in the bedroom with reflective material

760
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,180
the Panda film works in a bedroom also

761
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,559
carpet if you have that option cover the

762
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,259
floor if possible and right here I wrote

763
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,599
I like a pond liner for my floor I like

764
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,339
to get the pond liner about three to

765
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,689
four inches up the wall all the way

766
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,519
around the room so if you do

767
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,799
accidentally flood your rez in that room

768
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,849
or you spill a bucket or something

769
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,099
that's cool you just got a pond liner

770
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:06,799
there to catch it all and in the doorway

771
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:09,289
there to help keep the doorway all

772
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,159
filled up just cut you a door two by

773
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:16,399
four as wide as your doorway stand it up

774
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,590
on the outside and screw it in place and

775
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,850
that's a place to staple your pond liner

776
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,789
to yeah

777
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:24,740
so terms up a little bedroom into a pond

778
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,629
you know you're gonna have to step up

779
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,799
when you go in and out but you no big

780
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,600
deal I like the way you did that because

781
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,389
I did in kind of a shitty way in my my

782
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:38,089
newest build it works but I didn't do it

783
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:41,259
that smooth a nice little air seal if

784
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:41,259
you put it real tight and everything

785
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,529
little bit about because some of us are

786
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,079
gonna have to use that Trevis underneath

787
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,639
the door to let air in yeah that's

788
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,039
actually a pretty good spot if for some

789
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,460
of us and that's everything I'm talking

790
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:57,829
about is under ideal conditions yeah

791
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,289
this I mean there's I'm just trying to

792
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:02,149
throw out because there's so many ways

793
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,230
you could use I mean and so much

794
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:07,490
different scenarios if you walked into

795
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,049
okay this is a four bedroom house if we

796
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,490
walked into all four bedrooms and tried

797
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:12,230
to build a grow room in it we'd have to

798
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,759
deal with different obstacles in every

799
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,920
single room each room would have

800
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:26,119
different [ __ ] to deal with that rooms

801
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:28,970
only got a window on that side there'd

802
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,899
be some obstacles yeah all right so

803
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,829
wherever you are you're gonna have to

804
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,840
deal with some [ __ ] everything we're

805
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,220
saying is just kind of kind of hopefully

806
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,569
gonna work for what we're doing so now

807
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,730
we've got this clean room basically

808
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:40,189
we've got a hut that's sealed up we're

809
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,980
gonna add so you get your 8 by 8 by 8

810
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,690
room it's all Panda filmed or you've got

811
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,789
a 10 by 10 grow Hut or whatever some

812
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,890
similar oh now this is where you want to

813
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:50,629
add an intake and an outtake I talked in

814
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,950
that last episode a lot about how

815
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,680
important it is to vent you the air in

816
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:57,289
your grow I like those inline style fans

817
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,880
or blowers I like the vortex vortex has

818
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:01,069
always been reliable

819
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,200
and fan is great a little more expensive

820
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:05,389
with their adjustable speed and dude

821
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,400
those are reliable those GreenHeart

822
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,530
Hydrofarm blowers those are reliable

823
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,480
they work but they're loud yeah they're

824
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,589
really loved and they're the green

825
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,710
Hydrofarm inline boosters are chunk all

826
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:19,159
right yeah don't waste your money on

827
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,840
them

828
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,940
Jesse works in a hydro shop and I was

829
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,589
not gonna bash any brand but since he

830
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,350
works there and has to order from them

831
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:30,529
we'll let him go ahead and talk [ __ ]

832
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:34,069
yeah I mean it is what it is there's a

833
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:35,720
reason they sell so many refurbished

834
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:40,210
ones of those that's a lot of gross

835
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,210
stores we'll get to hydro from

836
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:47,029
responsible for that I like the room

837
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,150
we're gonna build we need an eighth inch

838
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:51,649
blower I'm gonna say get a can fan or a

839
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:55,970
vortex and don't buy one of the green

840
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:58,340
Hydrofarm ones it if you can afford the

841
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,130
can fan get that the vortex is ideal

842
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:10,039
next so yeah the Hydrofarm of blowers

843
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:13,610
are great it's the boosters can fans is

844
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:17,239
bad but okay it's that's not a primary

845
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:19,309
fan you know booster on the box okay all

846
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,918
right if you get the right blower you

847
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,239
don't need the booster so add that uh

848
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,668
let's see where were we eight inch

849
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,959
blower attach the blower to the framing

850
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:28,638
and get it fairly high in the room

851
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,840
depending on where you are some of you

852
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,610
guys might need to do this in the dead

853
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,139
center of the room so may need to do it

854
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,570
off to a corner just try to get it high

855
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,950
I think it's better to get the heat high

856
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:43,519
it's better to dump it out of the room

857
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:46,369
high you need to decide if you're gonna

858
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,559
use a fan in hoods or open hoods vinden

859
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:49,969
hoods are the ones just for the people

860
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,340
that are new with this your light

861
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,539
reflectors and hoods feinted ones mean

862
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,769
they have glass on the bottom and

863
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:56,869
they're sealed and your ducting will

864
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:59,329
attach to it and the light will be moved

865
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,460
away from the grow and not dropping down

866
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,750
on your plants if you have open hoods

867
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,179
you're gonna have to have more air

868
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,550
conditioning but you don't have to have

869
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:09,109
as much ducting so that's when you need

870
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,490
to think about what you got to do you

871
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,250
get more value for

872
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:14,629
for your light that way but

873
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,940
air-conditioned is expensive right

874
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,950
I like the vintage style yeah that's

875
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,200
pretty much the industry standard it's a

876
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:23,949
yeah unless you're in I've actually seen

877
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:31,730
a couple of huge rooms they just dump a

878
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:32,868
sea-levels stuff you can't be exhausting

879
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,108
yeah

880
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,849
takes a little bit more work time and if

881
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:39,858
you're really cool kids you got the

882
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,440
kavita's or the nano lux's or something

883
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:44,598
like that oh yeah those vetoes you can't

884
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,800
duck those so then you're gonna okay so

885
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,559
if you're using kavita's you're gonna

886
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,450
have to use more air conditioning a lot

887
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,429
more all right so if you're using open

888
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,629
hoods and you're trying for the ducting

889
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:56,118
situation we're doing you can just

890
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,710
attach a carbon filter to your 8-inch

891
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,050
blower and now you've pretty much

892
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:03,289
finished the extraction but if you're

893
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,089
using it make sure use the carbon filter

894
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:06,050
also that's what I want to add make sure

895
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:07,880
using the carbon filter on the

896
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,339
extraction fan sure drop is gonna stink

897
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,650
like all week six you're gonna be able

898
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:14,269
to smell everything I just hit week five

899
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,420
in the middle of week five in a room and

900
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:22,309
that uh that gorilla glue number four is

901
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:24,650
a stinky little [ __ ] you got a rug

902
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:27,409
ducting running four lights in this

903
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,059
design so I would do it kind of like

904
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:30,889
this but I'm gonna take a little drink

905
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:38,269
of this drink first right now taking a

906
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:41,059
drink that was well deserved all right

907
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:42,829
so if we're building this room with four

908
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:45,440
lights I would put a large carbon filter

909
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:46,940
I like the 39 by eight carbon filter

910
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,670
they have those available right now at

911
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,700
hydro indoor growing supplies then I

912
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,769
would take that 38 by eight inch carb 39

913
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:57,469
by 8 inch carbon filter I would use an 8

914
00:36:54,769 --> 00:37:00,440
inch wide duct that goes into 2 6 inch

915
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:02,358
ducts so now my 8 just went to 2 sixes

916
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,760
and I would use the Y to run the ducting

917
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:08,659
to two lights on each side so I would

918
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,240
have light one a light to a and then

919
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:14,000
light one B light to be on opposite

920
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,529
sides and then use another Y duct more

921
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,780
ducting and then a wide duct to bring

922
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,990
them back together and then attach that

923
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,630
Y duct and the 8 inch blower

924
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,159
ah I wrote something weird there

925
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,690
attached that why and the 8 inch blower

926
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,829
and the blowers in the air out of the

927
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,659
room something I wrote doesn't make

928
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:32,059
sense but attach that why duct to that

929
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:33,199
blower and thence in the air see I

930
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,608
already have something wrong every

931
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,199
because you should have carbon filter

932
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:38,059
blower is the way it should go

933
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:42,098
so should be carbon filter blower

934
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:45,650
ducting or a carbon filter blower why

935
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:47,720
ducting light light why and then out of

936
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,760
the house is where it should go

937
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:52,730
I tried something different but I must

938
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,880
have just been I at that time that be a

939
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:58,190
good spot for a booster fan would be the

940
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,108
perfect spot so in this case we're

941
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,480
running it out of the grow Hut or out of

942
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:03,769
this 8 by 8 room that we built or if

943
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,809
you're doing the bedroom that's when you

944
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:07,460
got to build that little wall and run it

945
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,849
out of that duct or that little box that

946
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:13,088
we made there that was a good burp I'm

947
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:15,470
glad I got that one off the microphone

948
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:16,880
in some cases you're gonna need to run

949
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:19,189
the ducting out of the house or in

950
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,890
another room booster fans come in handy

951
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,990
there try to keep the the ducting as

952
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:25,489
short and straight as possible you don't

953
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:27,429
want a lot of bends and your ducting and

954
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:30,649
you don't want excessive long ducting

955
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:33,230
also if you can hang your carbon filter

956
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,970
from the ceiling yeah because all of

957
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,829
your heat and steel air is gonna go up

958
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:43,098
hopefully air moves just like water so

959
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:44,900
you know if you got a pump it all the

960
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:47,720
way to the ceiling from the floor you

961
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,030
know that's just stealing energy there

962
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:54,649
you go and heat rises so put that thing

963
00:38:50,030 --> 00:39:00,200
up there yeah stinks more tooth yes

964
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:01,970
that's very will work better if you keep

965
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,889
the humidity at a more acceptable level

966
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,779
get it closer to 50 get away from that

967
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:07,219
70% like I've seen a couple of guys in

968
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,450
their flower rooms at 70% humidity

969
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,639
because they say it makes the butt

970
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:12,199
sticky don't make your button mouldy is

971
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:18,108
what you're gonna get bro I've seen

972
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:19,669
flowers with 0% humidity so much she's

973
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:22,460
gonna say it's Colorado bro don't look

974
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,990
at me like that and then your carbon

975
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,650
filter pretty much quits working at that

976
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,069
point too

977
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,500
yeah yeah you need some some moisture to

978
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,880
keep that charcoal active alright so

979
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,940
we've got an exhaust setup now you need

980
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,010
air in

981
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,349
depending on the situation I might make

982
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,410
a 4-inch hole six inches from the

983
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:42,239
corners and six inches off the ground so

984
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:44,639
imagine there's the corner of the room I

985
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,369
would go six inches in and six inches up

986
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,750
and make a four inch hole and then on

987
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:50,339
the opposite side of that corner do the

988
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,130
same thing and that'll give you eight

989
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,539
four inch holes for fresh air then I go

990
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,070
and get those HEPA filters from Lowe's

991
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,779
they're just little square sheets and I

992
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:02,280
staple those over the holes to keep any

993
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:04,140
dirt bugs freaking dog hair hippie hair

994
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
keep all that [ __ ] out of the girl room

995
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:07,650
with those HIPAA filters they weren't

996
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,930
pretty well I use driver Vince to cover

997
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,599
and prevent light leaks right on the

998
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:14,579
outside I put those on the outside to

999
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,869
wear or you can put on the inside too if

1000
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,849
you need to but I like the outside they

1001
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,049
look smoother but into the inside may

1002
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,789
work because now the lights come in this

1003
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,830
way it's not gonna get in there if

1004
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:26,300
you're using them for an intake don't

1005
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,299
forget to take the little flapper out

1006
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,250
yeah you could replace the small holes

1007
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,140
with one big hole and you can have a

1008
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,780
blower in there if you do have something

1009
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,670
bringing air in make sure that it is

1010
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,010
smaller than the exhaust fan you want to

1011
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,420
suck out more than what you're bringing

1012
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,430
in you want to create negative pressure

1013
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,930
in a grow room you want it to feel if

1014
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,549
you have a real door if it's in a

1015
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:51,779
bedroom when you open the door you want

1016
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,340
that you want to turn the knob and you

1017
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,160
want the door to fly open on its own

1018
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,350
that's how you know you got enough

1019
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:03,089
positive pressure so that's negative

1020
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:05,069
second oh I was actually thinking of a

1021
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:19,559
room I was just in so the door would

1022
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:21,180
have been guys what's gonna happen line

1023
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:27,059
up sewed 42 because Jesse just jumped to

1024
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:28,739
the future on me so you can replace all

1025
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,179
those holes are the big blower you've

1026
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,679
got fresh air being pulled in when the

1027
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,809
exhaust fan pulls out still air and

1028
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,369
humidity out of the room

1029
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:36,139
out of the house well does that even

1030
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,089
mean you tell I was lit when I wrote

1031
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:40,670
some of these notes and it got late so

1032
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,559
we got fresher coming in when the

1033
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,750
exhaust man pulls the stale air and

1034
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,579
humidity out of the room so you can add

1035
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,469
an air conditioner to bring in fresh air

1036
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:50,989
also you might be able to bring in

1037
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:54,769
enough air under the bedroom door if

1038
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:56,479
you're doing this in a bedroom I had a

1039
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:58,280
perfect little girl when I first started

1040
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,809
off that was in a bedroom and I had to

1041
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,610
blow her going over one light I had a

1042
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,929
six inch blower go I was going over two

1043
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,360
lights and sucking that straight out of

1044
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:06,710
the room and I hung a carbon filter in

1045
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,870
the ceiling and I just let the fresh air

1046
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,539
come right under the door and I feel

1047
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:13,400
like it was enough air yeah yeah I feel

1048
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:15,619
like it was sufficient in there I didn't

1049
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,059
get stifled or anything in there so

1050
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,980
that's basin of the door guys that could

1051
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,239
be useful you need fresh air coming in

1052
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,369
so if you're building this big 8 by 8

1053
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,469
room cut some holes in there or add a

1054
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:26,299
blower if you're using an 8 inch blower

1055
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:27,829
out you can use a four or a six inch

1056
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,650
blower and I think and you'll be just

1057
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:32,659
fine and even if you're running a sealed

1058
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,329
room I hate seeing this this is a little

1059
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:39,379
more advanced stuff but even sealed

1060
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:43,549
rooms need to have the ability to inject

1061
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,500
fresh air you know even if you don't use

1062
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:48,860
it but once a week or something like

1063
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,360
that but you still need to reset close

1064
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:58,599
your air every now and then

1065
00:42:50,360 --> 00:43:01,070
pumpkin co2 into he's talking about a

1066
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,469
control a closed environment agriculture

1067
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,480
room or everything is sealed up the only

1068
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:07,099
air that goes in the room is co2 that's

1069
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,179
supplemented with the co2 tank we'll

1070
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:11,509
talk a little bit about that in the

1071
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:13,849
future because plants actually breathe

1072
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,470
co2 and let out oxygen but I think just

1073
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:17,539
pumping all that co2 in there they are

1074
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:22,669
gonna need some oxygen your roots need

1075
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:24,590
oxygen yeah I agree you have to put some

1076
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,960
oxygen in that closed room somehow I

1077
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,180
just use those hipa filters and filter

1078
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,519
your air they also sell the shroom

1079
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:33,409
things the shroom covers I'm a big fan

1080
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,789
of those okay I've always thought they

1081
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:36,500
were a little overpriced so I've just

1082
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:38,690
stuck with the HEPA filters I can argue

1083
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,960
with ya

1084
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:48,019
we sell a much bigger intake filter

1085
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:52,530
that's similar to a carbon filter and

1086
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:56,639
you know it's not applica all situations

1087
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:59,550
but it's very recently priced for what

1088
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:02,159
it is the lifespan was just touch over

1089
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:05,220
100 and it does some serious filter ink

1090
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,779
so you can bring air from outside into

1091
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:07,589
your grow essentially if you filter it

1092
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,000
with that okay

1093
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,880
sure that's worth a ton of money it

1094
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,239
looks like a gigantic KN air K&amp;N air

1095
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:21,119
filter for like a freakin f-22 Raptor or

1096
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:31,559
some [ __ ] imagine you're done with that

1097
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:32,608
thing you go dump it in the I'm just

1098
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,230
picturing like some sort of Breaking Bad

1099
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:35,819
desert is where I was watching something

1100
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,710
in my mind dump it like throws it down

1101
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,359
in the desert and all these bugs and

1102
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,889
like imagine all the crazy [ __ ] that's

1103
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,679
gonna come out you got a blower attached

1104
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:46,019
to it sucking every bug that flies by is

1105
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,230
gonna go and just get sucked into that

1106
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:50,909
and get stuck in your trap now ah gonna

1107
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,909
hook it over the fence at the Monsanto

1108
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:54,379
facility there we go we're coming for

1109
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:57,269
you

1110
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,820
biological warfare we're coming for you

1111
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:01,769
alright I'm got like three more pages

1112
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,940
and stuff typed out I'm gonna have to

1113
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:04,940
edit out the F word so

1114
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,599
[Music]

1115
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:18,539
I was just so daydreaming and thinking

1116
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,338
about like where would this think like a

1117
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:21,838
boy was a picture in me and you do it in

1118
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:25,619
a picture like some shady grower with

1119
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,818
this big gigantic vent cleaner just

1120
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:37,170
rolling it out of the back of his truck

1121
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:44,449
in the desert pretty all kinds of weird

1122
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:47,608
bald danders and pollens yeah one thing

1123
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:50,578
when I was actually a research in it

1124
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:52,828
before we got it I was like oh this

1125
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:57,329
would be great for protection from

1126
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:59,809
outdoor yeah and matured or Anakapalle

1127
00:45:57,329 --> 00:45:59,809
and yeah

1128
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:04,949
I've got a male that might blow soon he

1129
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:10,410
just reminded me that I did not move it

1130
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:14,578
earlier I don't want that to happen

1131
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:17,190
premature yeah yeah I don't need him to

1132
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,960
go is it a bad spot all right so guys uh

1133
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,760
we've been ranting here we're gonna try

1134
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,349
to get back on track for a little bit we

1135
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,210
got 15 more minutes or so before

1136
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:27,240
everyone's gonna get a DD can already

1137
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,039
happen to us since we've got ducting in

1138
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,019
place let's hang up some lights guys in

1139
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,608
this room we have an 8 by 8 foot print

1140
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,710
and four lights that means we can use a

1141
00:46:32,608 --> 00:46:35,909
four by four area for each light it's

1142
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,329
gonna be bright in here that's what we

1143
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:38,039
want

1144
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:40,829
divide the room into perfect quarters

1145
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,239
find the center for each quarter hang

1146
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:44,400
your lights so they're centered in the

1147
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,449
corners or the quarters not corners you

1148
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,099
want them centered in the quarters so

1149
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,808
basically you got a four by four section

1150
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,369
with the light perfectly above it and

1151
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,260
every four by four space has a light

1152
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,608
right above it Jesse's doing math on how

1153
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,380
many lumens and how many watts per

1154
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:00,298
square foot that yes it's impressive you

1155
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,309
could do 600 watt lights in the setup if

1156
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:04,070
you wanted thousands are the way to go

1157
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:06,140
in here I think

1158
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,519
that's my professional opinion if you've

1159
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:12,079
got the electricity and you're building

1160
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:14,539
this room but thousands in there all

1161
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,420
right I use those little lab so 64

1162
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:21,018
square feet obviously that's a

1163
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,019
[Music]

1164
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:34,610
calculator that's 62 watts per square

1165
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:37,970
foot and what would be a recommendation

1166
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:41,500
mr. hydro shop expert that's a really

1167
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:43,669
healthy look per square foot all right

1168
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,139
this is gonna be a healthy room

1169
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,880
hey Ryan you've got a room kind of like

1170
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:48,109
this dude it's a good job you might have

1171
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,070
taken some advice from me

1172
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:55,640
that's no tiara rojo a hundred and

1173
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,920
twenty watts per square foot indoor acre

1174
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,929
we're talking about a spot called the

1175
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,550
indoor acre is what is that place is

1176
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:03,469
amazing there's like a mile and a half

1177
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,240
of plumbing in there just for the hydro

1178
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:07,099
kit all right so we're hanging our

1179
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,559
lights there in the corner the core the

1180
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:11,480
the center of the quarters of the room

1181
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:13,279
right there might be a lot of editing on

1182
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,599
the show guys we're dabbed out so I like

1183
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,280
to use those little hooks I sell at

1184
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,110
Lowe's they're just screws with a little

1185
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,680
circle at the end of it basically screw

1186
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:24,260
that into the ceiling the ceiling beams

1187
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,049
make sure you get a stood yes

1188
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:35,720
well they're only be studs there I mean

1189
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:37,820
or a plastic or a stud for that and it

1190
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,759
helps you sooner your lights take to

1191
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,140
eight-foot two by fours screw them to

1192
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,850
the ceiling then push your lights

1193
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:45,980
anywhere you want you always know he hit

1194
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:48,339
a stone yeah I need to see that one one

1195
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,340
area

1196
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:57,179
yeah that I worked at a place where the

1197
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:01,769
lights were I worked for two companies

1198
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:03,358
in the same building ironically and it

1199
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:06,568
the first company I didn't help set

1200
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:09,358
anything up and all the lights were hung

1201
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:12,088
from a floating crit ceiling they go

1202
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,788
Raptor hoods with little tiny plastic

1203
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:18,748
hooks it's absolutely like just super

1204
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:20,069
dangerous dumbass move thought out what

1205
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:23,098
I went to work for the other company I

1206
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:26,009
got paid to do by for structure all

1207
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:29,519
through the bit of what could support a

1208
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:30,719
couple gorillas so be safe when you're

1209
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,008
building stuff we've talked about not

1210
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:33,989
being that [ __ ] that burns down the

1211
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,269
house also don't be the guy that takes

1212
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:37,380
down the bedroom on accident if you're

1213
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:41,308
renting you're gonna have to pay for

1214
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,838
whatever you mess up all right I like

1215
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:44,339
those little light hangers take my

1216
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,159
lights the ratchet style ones those are

1217
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:48,900
perfect them hang all four lights screw

1218
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,969
in your bulbs and wipe off the bulbs

1219
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,369
when you're done wipe them off I like to

1220
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:54,659
use like a thing that you should be

1221
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:57,539
cleaning your drums with it's a little

1222
00:49:54,659 --> 00:50:02,038
soft it's like a microfiber yeah clean

1223
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:05,130
it off with that sunglasses in that uh

1224
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:07,410
in the bulb or any dust or dirt on there

1225
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,028
or any oil from your finger on there any

1226
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:11,068
little thing that close to the bulb is

1227
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:13,619
gonna definitely kill lumens make sure

1228
00:50:11,068 --> 00:50:15,568
your bulb is screwed in completely yeah

1229
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,640
deck notes and all of your connections

1230
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:20,548
are all pushed inside under ballast as

1231
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:23,248
well so screwing your bulbs wipe it off

1232
00:50:20,548 --> 00:50:25,679
make sure it's tight run the ducting

1233
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:27,238
from the blower to the wide dog to each

1234
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,159
light back to the other Y out of your

1235
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,019
grow room and then secure all of those

1236
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,598
ducting 'z with tape there's gonna be a

1237
00:50:31,018 --> 00:50:36,088
lot of pressure on the ducts 1/8 inch

1238
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,969
blower puts out a lot of pressure that

1239
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:42,389
may be a good idea also to grab a fan

1240
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:44,278
speed controller you plug that in and

1241
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:45,659
then you plug your fan into that and you

1242
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:47,869
can actually your blower your 8-inch

1243
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:51,268
vortex Bowl or you can adjust how much

1244
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:53,009
by percentage of from only works about

1245
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:54,419
50 percent is as low as I think it goes

1246
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:57,208
but then you can go from 50 all the way

1247
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,650
to 100 if you're wanting to keep a

1248
00:50:57,208 --> 00:51:01,049
little humidity in the room

1249
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,960
it down you can get it down to you know

1250
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,100
50% humidity turning down to 70% it'll

1251
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,960
help you out that's actually how I run

1252
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:10,049
it in one space at about 70% all the

1253
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,269
time so many the can fans come with the

1254
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:14,160
little three-speed switch on the core

1255
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:17,309
already adjusted to it yeah so that may

1256
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,809
be beneficial and the hyper fan the best

1257
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:22,049
fan on the market might that usually

1258
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,179
comes with one built in that's a product

1259
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,430
for me when I upgrade it's time for some

1260
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:28,379
of those alright so now we've got

1261
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:30,210
ducting you got lights on its kinda

1262
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,950
starting to look like a grow room you

1263
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,610
gotta hang a couple fans on the walls I

1264
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:37,500
would put fans right above the expected

1265
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,849
height of your plants like if you think

1266
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,039
your plants are gonna get five feet tall

1267
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:42,869
put a fan at five and a half feet right

1268
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,849
between the fan can't or the light can

1269
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:46,529
it with a damn lot of words right

1270
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:48,630
between the plant canopy and the lights

1271
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,550
is kind of where I like a fan yeah keep

1272
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,130
the air moving you don't want there to

1273
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,920
get stale plants suck up the co2 in the

1274
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:57,570
room quickly they can use the co2 around

1275
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,220
them super quickly and you just gotta

1276
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,000
move the air so there's more co2 for

1277
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:04,349
them to use up yeah

1278
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,079
go ahead we're gonna say would you throw

1279
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:09,829
maybe a box fan on the floor I do like a

1280
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,119
box fan on the floor super low speed um

1281
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,769
if you're on a budget the box man is

1282
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,659
awesome if you have more of a budget I

1283
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:17,400
would recommend a carbon filter with

1284
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,079
like a six inch drawer on top of it just

1285
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,030
dead sitting in the center of the room

1286
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:23,190
put some ducting off the blower up to

1287
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,170
the ceiling and just move that air from

1288
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,570
the floor back up to the ceiling and

1289
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,889
you're picking up co2 off the ground and

1290
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:32,010
putting it back up to fall back down

1291
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:33,750
onto your plants nice yeah that's just

1292
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,250
differences in budgets if you've got a

1293
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,559
low but if you've got thirty bucks by a

1294
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,510
fan if you got 160 by a blower and a

1295
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,309
filter yeah just kind of or I guess it's

1296
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,720
gonna be closer to 260 I guess that

1297
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:44,719
blower is gonna be a hundred and twenty

1298
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:50,940
expensive you know I've watched

1299
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,579
everything escalate in price since I've

1300
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,070
been expanding my grows and since

1301
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,719
Colorado has been getting more popular

1302
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,760
everything has just gone up in price and

1303
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:01,980
it's not even a competitive raise it's a

1304
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,330
gouging raising week I can see it they

1305
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:08,690
know what we're doing I remember buying

1306
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:10,519
a light in like 2002

1307
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,320
and keeping your head down at the store

1308
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:14,840
trying not to be noticed man I swear I

1309
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,340
paid like five six hundred bucks for my

1310
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:21,320
first light setup and it's just a

1311
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:25,430
magnetic 400 watt like nothing special

1312
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,340
whatsoever so but everything else I feel

1313
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:30,440
like has gotten more expensive yeah

1314
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,910
lighting is the only only thing and

1315
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,369
actually I guess it's just because

1316
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:37,519
there's so many newer options but basic

1317
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:40,130
lighting I Felix gotten cheaper yeah and

1318
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,869
more reliable I remember you you buy

1319
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:44,210
[ __ ] and you'll just die on you and I

1320
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:46,059
was the last at least a year or two yeah

1321
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:48,679

1383
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:29,600
years I can't remember exactly when I

1384
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:31,460
know I was a vegetarian in 2002 for sure

1385
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,349
can't remember before that when I

1386
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,639
started but there was an event that

1387
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,839
happened one of my friends I hadn't seen

1388
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,909
in a while made fun of me for being a

1389
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:42,200
vegetarian at Bonnaroo and the first

1390
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:44,029
Bonnaroo was 2002 since then since I

1391
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:45,289
started eating better right I try to eat

1392
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,690
a little better a better a better all

1393
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:49,579
the time but the more I take care of my

1394
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,079
body the better I feel it's so great so

1395
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:53,509
eat your vegetables guys that's a pizza

1396
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:56,630
not don't eat as much meat you know even

1397
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:59,030
if you eat meat America eats way way too

1398
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:02,809
much of it try to eat food quit eating

1399
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,280
like food product like processed [ __ ]

1400
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:06,799
that kind of resembles food you don't

1401
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,180
want that you want food it's got like 17

1402
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,910
ingredients in it that's not food

1403
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:13,589
anymore yeah look for fewer ingredients

1404
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:18,319
and the easier they are to pronounce

1405
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:20,760
yeah all those doses and X doses and the

1406

[ __ ] come here my man with Rasta Jeff

1575
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:22,570
for some reason okay the owners of the

1576
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,460
spot said that he could come smoke with

1577
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:27,338
me but he probably would not make it to

1578
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,749
his show so he often did not smoke

1579
01:04:27,338 --> 01:04:35,858
he was like you look like you might

1580
01:04:28,748 --> 01:04:50,918
murder me with some smoke so yeah and

1581
01:04:35,858 --> 01:04:55,150
unfortunately after that so we can't

1582
01:04:50,918 --> 01:04:56,469

1583

genetics Facebook page and took it from

1688
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,738
an interactive page and made it to just

1689
01:11:57,130 --> 01:12:02,180
a business page which I find boring so

1690
01:11:59,738 --> 01:12:03,839
I've gotten a lot of spare time to check

1691

me off taking my page down like that

1696
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:18,039
without even talking to me dicks we've

1697
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,050
been doing grow lessons teaching you

1698
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:21,399
guys or trying to sort of stoner style

1699
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,659
teach you guys how to set up a grow room

1700
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:24,729
for yourself so that you can be

1701
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:26,649
self-sufficient we've gotten the room

1702
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:30,009
bill we talked about the best places to

1703
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:31,210
do it we give you a good guide so far

1704
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:33,489
we've got a room built with lights

1705
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:35,680
hanging but we haven't hung our ballasts

1706
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:38,199
yet and our timers so that's kind of

1707
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,400
where we are if you guys need to catch

1708
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:40,630
up I'll take a pause and you can go

1709
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:44,519
listen to the two episodes before this

1710
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:44,520
you can catch up or we are pausing

1711
01:12:50,510 --> 01:13:07,770
there's another chance Oh anything is

1712
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:09,359
fun I like the flow yeah we built an 8x8

1713
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:11,310
room you've got your poly wraps were

1714
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:14,219
around everything it's all sealed up you

1715
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:17,969
got your lights hanging now what I would

1716
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:20,460
like to do is show you tell you the way

1717
01:13:17,969 --> 01:13:21,840
I hang my ballasts and my electronics

1718
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,630
and Jesse and I have a lot of different

1719
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,949
ideas so this will get fun I use a piece

1720
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,199
of plywood to mount all of the

1721
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:29,550
electronics in one area at Lowe's or

1722
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,779
whatever hardware store they actually

1723
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:33,119
sell a pre-cut board

1724
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:36,000
I think it's 24 it may be 18 inches by

1725
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,399
36 inches you can screw that right under

1726
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,800
the wall and you can I can fit four I

1727
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:43,409
can fit five ballasts and my power box

1728
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,449
on that so all the bowels are plugged in

1729
01:13:43,409 --> 01:13:47,099
to the power box and it's also screwed

1730
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:48,359
to the board I screw the board to the

1731
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,180
framing on the outside of the grow room

1732
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:52,469
to keep the heat down Jesse was talking

1733
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,119
about if you put it on the inside keep

1734
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,230
it close to the door the outside is

1735
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,729
ideal because if something goes wrong

1736
01:13:55,229 --> 01:13:59,459
you don't have to go in there to turn

1737
01:13:56,729 --> 01:14:01,799
everything off yeah also keep a fire

1738
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:04,800
extinguisher near that box that's

1739
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,909
something that I recommend you don't

1740
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,619
want to have to run into the Grill Room

1741
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:08,849
if keep a smoke alarm in there if there

1742
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:10,199
is a fire you don't want to have to go

1743
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:11,489
half way through the room because we get

1744
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:13,349
into your fire extinguisher you want to

1745
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:15,869
have it outside kick the door open and

1746
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:17,640
start spraying put out fire that's your

1747
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:19,319
that's your biggest fear but we you got

1748
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,600
to be prepared for that so you got this

1749
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:23,130
board you got four ballasts you've got I

1750
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,450
put a powder box on there cuz that's how

1751
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:29,609
I plug everything in yeah I like those

1752
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:31,079
power boxes they're really reliable they

1753
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:33,569
don't pay me to say that I buy them

1754
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:35,189
later a darker made in America yes I was

1755
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:37,590
gonna ask you here's a random side note

1756
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:39,829
what ballasts are made in America do you

1757
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,829
know

1758
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:46,510
you can google that while I read on for

1759
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:48,010
a second it's almost time for me to buy

1760
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:50,140
several more ballasts and I would like

1761
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:53,590
to buy american-made products because I

1762
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:55,840
noticed that the what the hell brand is

1763
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:57,760
that the Quantum's that used to be made

1764
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,440
in Germany now they come with the made

1765
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:07,960
in China or a made in Korea sticker on

1766
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:11,019
them really quickly those used to be my

1767
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,119
go-to s because they don't sales like a

1768
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,590
next gen does next gen will just shoot

1769
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:25,738
out alone it'll try to start up and fail

1770
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:25,739
just before I need to replace my 401

flowering you don't need to run all that

1774
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,750
much if you're just doing a female hunt

1775
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:48,640
for boys how many people feed all that

1776
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:52,300
for males if you're four meals you're

1777
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,610
probably not everything we've said so

1778
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:56,170
far at the table right here if you're

1779
01:15:54,609 --> 01:15:57,729
female hunting for males you're invited

1780

send me a message we'll find you

agriculture hotmail.com we're just

1782
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:06,130
strategizing about the very subject

1783
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:08,079
yeah dude can we talk about that yeah go

1784
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:10,539
for it I'm getting really excited about

1785
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:11,920
it me too I read genetics of course I'm

1786
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:13,149
Ross to Jeff from I originates I've been

1787
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,409
around and I read genetics for a couple

1788
01:16:13,149 --> 01:16:16,839
few years now it's been public seeds

1789
01:16:14,409 --> 01:16:18,510
have been available I cannot keep up

1790
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,800
with the demand for my product I've got

1791
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:22,390
enough reading space to breed plenty of

1792
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,980
seeds but when they go on sale at

1793
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:25,030
nature's drain remedies they sell out in

1794
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:28,119
like 48 hours

1795
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:29,859
yeah so our good buddy Jesse has stepped

1796
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:32,349
up to the plate and now I think Jesse

1797
01:16:29,859 --> 01:16:34,299
will I'm gonna run a bunch of his [ __ ]

1798

as soon as it's done and when I see that

1799
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,360
his stuff does good we're gonna add him

1800
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,890
to our lineup he'll be part of team I

1801
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:42,359
read genetics will be another breeder

1802
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:45,439
he'll be our second breeder tripod farms

tripled in size since I started do you

1814
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,690
find me an american-made ballast no I'm

1815
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:56,849
not fine I don't suspect the galaxies

1816
01:17:52,689 --> 01:18:03,519
are I know some light a lot of their

1817
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:05,050
products are made in America if you guys

1818
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,850
have an idea of a good american-made

1819
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:09,190
ballast let me know cuz it's for me I'm

1820
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:11,730
shopping I need a lot of them oh man you

1821
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:16,000
know what actually I think I know of one

1822
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:19,178
it's a really expensive one

1823
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,369
no those be made in Holland yes what's

1824
01:18:19,179 --> 01:18:23,140
the kavita's competitor the e paps

1825
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:25,869
keep apps that really those are China

1826
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:30,369
China's over the nano Lux TVs I know

1827
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:32,769
those are wonderful ash lights are made

1828
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:35,408
in America or if they're made in China I

1829
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:39,010
would suspect that maybe either

1830
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:41,460
I'd really hope they are yeah Oh so

1831
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:43,440
let's tech made in California okay

1832
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:58,069
yeah very good stuff something to check

1833
01:18:43,439 --> 01:19:00,869
out King Z them I suspect that maybe the

1834
01:18:58,069 --> 01:19:04,349
hoarder lux makes ballast I think maybe

1835
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:05,640
their stuffs made in America okay I want

1836
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,010
to buy american-made ballast guys I

1837
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,140
encourage you to also I take this board

1838
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:12,600
that I bought at Lowe's and I put the

1839
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,070
board on the floor and I'd mount my bow

1840
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,360
I said don't screw it to the floor I set

1841
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:16,799
it on the floor so I can work let me be

1842
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:18,779
clear about that I sent the board on the

1843
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,760
floor and then I screw the ballasts to

1844
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:22,920
the board and then I screwed my power

1845
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,510
box to the board and now this board is

1846
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:27,329
movable you can hang your ballasts damn

1847
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,619
near anywhere you want both that to or

1848
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,760
is convenient for you if it's the

1849
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:30,809
outside of the room is what I would

1850
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,150
prefer because then you're keeping heat

1851
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:35,520
up those balazar yeah do it outside of

1852
01:19:33,149 --> 01:19:37,199
the room and then then you can mess with

1853
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,480
your timers and stuff and not be in the

1854
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,649
room so that it's just easier so bolt

1855
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:41,759
that wherever you need screw that

1856
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:43,229
wherever you need to the framing then

1857
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,119
run that wiring through a small hole

1858
01:19:43,229 --> 01:19:47,099
nepali and tape over it to keep the

1859
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,739
light from leaking so now you've got air

1860
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:52,530
and air out lights and power if probably

1861
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:54,420
gonna need to cool down the room an air

1862
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:56,239
conditioner is definitely what you're

1863
01:19:54,420 --> 01:20:00,690
gonna need you may need a dehumidifier

1864
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:02,939
so take another small board and put your

1865
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:04,559
air conditioner thermostat on there if

1866
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:06,989
you have one that doesn't attach to the

1867
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,640
air conditioner you can plug your air

1868
01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:12,029
conditioner into a temperature sensor

1869
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,740
and hang that on the wall and then when

1870
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:15,479
the temperature gets to a certain thing

1871
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:16,529
up to the certain temperature dream that

1872
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:18,599
you can set the day and night

1873
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:20,460
temperature and then that little leader

1874
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,660
will tell the air conditioner when they

1875
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,890
come on and want to go off and you can

1876
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:25,050
do that with almost any piece of

1877
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,840
equipment in your room you can automate

1878
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:29,720
your your dehumidifier your air

1879
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,430
conditioner you can automate your fans

1880
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:34,409
in one room I've got a emergency

1881
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:36,090
shutdown switch if it hits over 9 to 5

1882
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:36,829
degrees in that room everything turns

1883
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,569
off every

1884
01:20:36,829 --> 01:20:39,829
even the air conditioners because I

1885
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:41,119
don't know what's causing the problems

1886
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:42,769
when everything just shuts off and

1887
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,420
Debian tips are only gonna be 70

1888
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:47,930
something in that area anyway there's no

1889
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:49,670
there's no light so automation but all

1890
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:51,710
your automation stuff on one board and

1891
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:54,920
put that where it's visible put a

1892
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:57,319
thermometer a hygrometer on there you

1893
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,760
want to be able to see has to be inside

1894
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,739
the room so put that in the room if you

1895
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,760
have to if you get this it's if you want

1896
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:05,059
that outside of their little be more

1897
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,230
expensive trust me that will probably

1898
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,910
have to go in the room so just put all

1899
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:09,949
your stuff onto one board and nail it to

1900
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:12,829
one spot up high where you can see it a

1901
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:13,909
random side note when you build the

1902
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:15,710
drill room and you're thinking about

1903
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:18,829
planting your grow room think of water

1904
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:20,480
goes low electrical goes high you want

1905
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:22,189
your water low on the ground if you have

1906
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:23,539
a bucket if you got a reservoir there's

1907
01:21:22,189 --> 01:21:26,059
no need to lift that up off the ground

1908
01:21:23,539 --> 01:21:27,649
too high keep it low because if it does

1909
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,270
topple over you don't want it to spill

1910
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:32,089
on your electronics which should be kept

1911
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:34,490
above waist high I don't run conduit

1912
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:46,670
along the wall lower than about 36

1913
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:48,199
inches that's my waist keep water low

1914
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:49,640
electricity high because you don't want

1915
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:51,739
to pour water into electricity

1916
01:21:49,640 --> 01:22:04,100
ever keep your cords organized you guys

1917
01:21:51,739 --> 01:22:06,829
I've seen so many messes of fire

1918
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:08,030
detector or you can get in the room of

1919
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:09,019
the fire detector outside of the room

1920
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:11,479
those are little side notes that I wrote

1921
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:13,970
yeah so you're gonna need air

1922
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:15,500
conditioning is what I wrote down next I

1923
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,329
follow the general rule of three

1924
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,520
thousand BTUs of air-conditioning per

1925
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:21,529
thousand watt light if you want to use

1926
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,180
those traditional ACS you can put in the

1927
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:24,590
window you can cuddle that do go in a

1928
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,350
window you can cut a hole in the poly

1929
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:29,539
and not the AC to the framing but that's

1930
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:31,760
gonna heat up whatever room you dump the

1931
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:34,039
AC exhaust into if you're in a garage or

1932
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,349
unused basement that's cool but you

1933
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:38,210
can't heat up like if you're

1934
01:22:36,349 --> 01:22:39,828
Sasa Kido it's gonna go somewhere we're

1935
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,179
just gonna continue to heat up yeah you

1936
01:22:39,828 --> 01:22:42,289
can run it a lot of people run it

1937
01:22:41,179 --> 01:22:44,569
straight through the chimney if you got

1938
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:46,368
one I've seen it going to the Attic if

1939
01:22:44,569 --> 01:22:47,448
you need to if you guys are in illegal

1940
01:22:46,368 --> 01:22:48,500
states you're gonna have to fly this a

1941
01:22:47,448 --> 01:22:49,578
little better because your heat

1942
01:22:48,500 --> 01:23:00,710
signature is what they're gonna look for

1943
01:22:49,578 --> 01:23:09,529
the bus do I think 2014 almost 15 where

1944
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:11,000
the cops can do just about whatever then

1945
01:23:09,529 --> 01:23:12,229
they'll just send a car to go sit in

1946
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,689
front your house and then don't notice

1947
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:16,759
some [ __ ] you know the cops are the

1948
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:19,158
worst gang that we have nowadays the

1949
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,079
worst criminals on the streets under air

1950
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:23,629
conditioners if it's going to outside a

1951
01:23:21,078 --> 01:23:26,319
lot of them or if their conditioners in

1952
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:31,328
your room and it's in an outside window

1953
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:36,500
light shines through yes you can take a

1954
01:23:31,328 --> 01:23:38,299
can of spray paint get you remember how

1955
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:41,448
I did it but there's some way you can

1956
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:44,900
give a nozzle on there that you can

1957
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:46,969
stick a little straw in like wd-40 say

1958
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:50,750
the wd-40 Scott yeah perfectly

1959
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:54,289
oh and spray the white foam inside the

1960
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:55,789
vents with black spray paint and it's

1961
01:23:54,289 --> 01:23:57,469
all clean and everything let's not be

1962
01:23:55,789 --> 01:24:00,170
reflective stops the light from coming

1963
01:23:57,469 --> 01:24:05,500
out good idea good idea if you're

1964
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:08,649
putting that in the so cool actually

1965
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:10,210
shut up the sub cool did you so I didn't

1966
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:11,529
brag about this I posted a really sweet

1967
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,270
picture to Instagram the other day and

1968
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:15,729
sub cool actually sent me a message that

1969
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:18,400
said we should collab so in the future

1970
01:24:15,729 --> 01:24:20,199
there could be some TGA I read genetic

1971
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:21,250
stuff happening but uh right now I'm

1972
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:37,470
gonna focus on what I'm doing with

1973
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:40,090
Jessie because I know that's for real I

1974
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:42,159
had to melt I wanted to say before we

1975
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:50,460
get sidetracked the black spray-paint on

1976
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:52,239
the air-conditioner I like to use the

1977
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,640
energy but I like those air conditioners

1978
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:56,199
on wheels they have a little duct you

1979
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,640
can just duct it right out of a six-inch

1980
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:59,470
duct it works perfect

1981
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,720
those are glorious they take a little

1982
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,550
more air a little more electricity yeah

1983
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:06,340
but they're awesome also you need maybe

1984
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:08,289
a fan speed controller if you're those

1985
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,060
are always helpful just there's always a

1986
01:25:08,289 --> 01:25:13,060
reason to add a fan speed controller I

1987
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:15,310
bought a little thermostat thing to turn

1988
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:19,390
off my air cooled fans when it gets too

1989
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:21,789
cold outside yeah I walked out to the

1990
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:25,780
room the other day and there's 4000 watt

1991
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:29,890
lights burning and normally you know

1992
01:25:25,779 --> 01:25:32,199
it's 70 to 68 degrees in there and it

1993
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:34,329
was like 55 degrees yeah I should have

1994
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:36,760
all the fans off everything and it took

1995
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:39,909
most of the life cycle the heat back oh

1996
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:41,500
wow yeah I love it just went I it was

1997
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:43,720
negative six degrees here these are

1998
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:46,569
night where we live very [ __ ] cool

1999
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,280
that is cold yeah my my ground my air

2000
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:50,859
conditioners aren't on in any of my rows

2001
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:52,750
right now that's okay I've turned all of

2002
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:54,939
the air conditioners off just let that

2003
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:58,710
receiving some electricity right now a

2004
01:25:54,939 --> 01:25:58,710
lot of electricity yeah

2005
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:47,789
yeah I'm that guy that automates as much

2006
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:50,579
as I or everything will go wrong I have

2007
01:26:47,789 --> 01:26:52,229
to love this room almost everything else

2008
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:59,579
of course you light cycles your air

2009
01:26:52,229 --> 01:27:03,719
conditioning your co2 they want to ban

2010
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:05,309
co2 augmentation things they wrote the

2011
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:21,869
rules so we'll talk about that more in

2012
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:23,550
the future we just mounted the ballasts

2013
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:24,779
right to a board then we put the board

2014
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:26,190
right up on the wall then you got to run

2015
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:27,239
all the cables that's the part I skip to

2016
01:27:26,189 --> 01:27:28,439
make sure when you push the cables

2017
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:31,109
together make sure you push them tight

2018
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,519
oh all the way tight because when that

2019
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:34,349
shits loose that's electricity that's

2020
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,200
why right there just being exposed I

2021
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:39,090
want to design I've made him myself I

2022
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:42,479
just bend them all up but out of wire

2023
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:44,400
but do safety wire - yeah - hold it all

2024
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,079
together when I was in bands I learned

2025
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:48,089
to tie cords that are connected together

2026
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,470
in that knot or if you pull instead it

2027
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:51,659
tightens that knot stead of em coming

2028
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:54,680
apart I like that move a lot I used to

2029
01:27:51,659 --> 01:27:54,680
be a roadie a musician

2030
01:27:55,578 --> 01:28:00,719
yeah I talked about a tip on pictures

2031
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:04,559
and since we're talking about running a

2032
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:06,599
course here it is the cord the grunts

2033
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:08,969
from the ballast to the light is what

2034
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:13,380
causes all the bars in your picture so

2035
01:28:08,969 --> 01:28:14,698
the shorter those are and the neither

2036
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:18,889
they're hung and everything

2037
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:18,888
the last bars and [ __ ] you'll have

2038
01:28:19,248 --> 01:28:25,019
because it's the magnetics it causes

2039
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:26,670
that yeah okay I think that's a good tip

2040
01:28:25,019 --> 01:28:30,239
I didn't know that I can't remember I

2041
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:32,849
have it no I didn't really care about my

2042
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:36,928
new room I think if you keep all

2043
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:38,940
accorded away from each other to you

2044
01:28:36,929 --> 01:28:40,349
know individually instead of so they

2045
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:45,509
don't try not together on the ceiling

2046
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:48,719
okay make sense

2047
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:50,010
I wrote down so much stuff on so many

2048
01:28:48,719 --> 01:29:12,179
different papers I'm looking for them

2049
01:28:50,010 --> 01:29:14,309
all we've got this room mostly figured

2050
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:16,710
out we got lights hung we've got all of

2051
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:18,179
our automation set up hopefully we got

2052
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:20,010
air going in we got air going out we've

2053
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:21,510
got an air conditioner now that you got

2054
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:25,139
most everything set up and get your pond

2055
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:29,998
liner on the floor I would add four four

2056
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:31,979
by four tables I use brands but I used

2057
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:33,420
the Hydrofarm four by four white flood

2058
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:34,889
tables because they're perfect yeah

2059
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,809
those are perfect I like to raise them

2060
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:39,179
up off the ground I like the white

2061
01:29:36,809 --> 01:29:40,800
botanic air trees you can find someone

2062
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:48,710
to make you a stand for them or you can

2063
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:48,710
put them on buckets that are prefab

2064
01:29:49,250 --> 01:30:21,479
and cold temperature a little more

2065
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:23,250
airflow to the soil to see what's

2066
01:30:21,479 --> 01:31:26,609
happening at the soil or the bottom

2067
01:30:23,250 --> 01:31:31,350
foliage cubes disaster what ups were

2068

in the drag queen you could email

2109
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:35,460
comedy works and they put me and my crew

it

2115
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,490
but then they would bring in

2116
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:47,550
normal-looking people and set them in

2117

trucks so it's not one of those diesel

2152
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:48,930
very functional it's not it's not a

2153
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:50,939
truck it's a working man's truck you can

2154
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:52,470
deliver soil anywhere in Pueblo or

2155
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:55,729

2156
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:59,800
team at the top of Pikes Peak Oh easily

2157
01:35:55,729 --> 01:36:01,808
yeah all right wherever I like Inbox

2158
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,029
how it is around here right now it's

2159
01:36:01,809 --> 01:36:06,190
just slushy just go slow you guys would

2160
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:10,689
be cool seems like nobody's driven in

2161
01:36:06,189 --> 01:36:17,078
the snow before done this it's just a

2162
01:36:10,689 --> 01:36:18,638
year ago we're kind of ranting here

2163
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:21,429
we've had some dabs I hope you're taking

2164
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,050
dabs so you're building a hydro Hut

2165
01:36:21,429 --> 01:36:25,359
that's very similar to this setup I'd

2166
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:26,619
run the ducting for the lights there's a

2167
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,269
couple way to do the lights but I would

2168
01:36:26,618 --> 01:36:30,219
run the lights the ducting straight

2169
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:31,630
through the hut so that the heat never

2170
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:33,219
makes it into the hut there's a hole on

2171
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:38,380
the left side and the right side of the

2172
01:36:33,219 --> 01:36:41,828
hut at the top once I'd run the ducting

2173
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:43,600
from the outside over the blower over

2174
01:36:41,828 --> 01:36:46,708
the light and out of the other side

2175
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,709
[Music]

2176
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:51,609
never actually stays inside the grow

2177
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:53,259
house there's also a little hole the

2178
01:36:51,609 --> 01:36:56,759
roof of the hut I had a blower there I

2179
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:59,260
said just the roof that's all the top

2180
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:01,030
fresh air through the hut constantly I

2181
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:02,530
put a carbon filter and a blower inside

2182
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:05,618
the hut and fit it out of the top there

2183
01:37:02,529 --> 01:37:08,229
makes the air flow pull air in from the

2184
01:37:05,618 --> 01:37:09,670
bottom and the heat goes out the top and

2185
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:11,078
always remember always remember that

2186
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:12,699
your blower can pull more air they're

2187
01:37:11,078 --> 01:37:14,198
gonna push then it can push I wrote down

2188
01:37:12,698 --> 01:37:16,210
a lot of shitty half-assed notes right

2189
01:37:14,198 --> 01:37:18,908
there those notes were full sentences

2190
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:21,010
blowers work better when they're outside

2191
01:37:18,908 --> 01:37:22,920
of the room it's the same reason you

2192
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:25,989
never see the first fan in the bathroom

2193
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,670
is mounted up in the ceiling easier to

2194
01:37:25,988 --> 01:37:30,729
pull air out the end it is to push

2195
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:33,520
definitely easier to pull here's a

2196
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:35,859
question for you do you run a carbon

2197
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,079
filter intense when your click the

2198
01:37:35,859 --> 01:37:40,000
collecting pollen you know I've I don't

2199
01:37:38,078 --> 01:37:41,469
because I don't have a blower at all in

2200
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,800
my tent where I'm collecting pollen I

2201
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:43,800
run

2202
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:55,920
dude this is crazy secret with one

2203
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:16,029
flower and one under thousand well I'm

2204
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:18,850
flowering a couple under his house would

2205
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:22,329
walk right now so I think I might be

2206
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:26,260
changing that out to different if I want

2207
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:27,550
to see their fool I don't tell people I

2208
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:32,020
take a brown paper bag and put it right

2209
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:34,150
over the top Cola yeah what I'm sure

2210
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:36,340
that I see him a whole bunch

2211
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:37,989
I just cut that sucker off and then I

2212
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:40,150
have the branch sticking out of the bag

2213
01:38:37,989 --> 01:38:41,710
and I'll hold it with my hand around the

2214
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:43,539
branch and pull the branch out of the

2215
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:51,579
bag slowly and as you pull you knock

2216
01:38:43,539 --> 01:38:53,529
everything off into the bag I use a

2217
01:38:51,579 --> 01:38:58,720
drumhead actually an old drum head flip

2218
01:38:53,529 --> 01:39:02,139
it upside down and I'm gonna repurpose

2219
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:04,000
that [ __ ] so if you leave those in the

2220
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:06,130
hut with that bag over there with the

2221
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,710
blower on the top it doesn't steal a lot

2222
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:10,210
but it does take a little bit but you're

2223
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:12,250
gonna make enough we'll see you know I'm

2224
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:13,539
also fetal hunting - all right just

2225
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:16,270

have you but you gotta have one yes I

2239
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:59,750
recently took they all cut are they all

2240
01:39:57,229 --> 01:40:03,349
rooted most of the seeds I've sprouted

2241
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:06,979
are all germinating and I'm working on

2242
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:09,470
another project I tell everybody this I

2243
01:40:06,979 --> 01:40:10,759
am starting to f to black cherry Kim I'm

2244
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:13,310
doing the pheno hunt to find the male on

2245
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,900
the female to f2 that I plan to start

2246
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:18,350
the flowering cycle right at the start

2247
01:40:14,899 --> 01:40:20,210
of the year so by March first dish I

2248
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:22,670
should have found a good male and a good

2249
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:25,939
female that will be used the clones of

2250
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:27,800
those will be next to be bred to me

2251
01:40:25,939 --> 01:40:29,449
don't use two females and one male I'll

2252
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,150
use a purple female and a non purple

2253
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:33,889
female let's see what the progeny make

2254
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:36,859
definitely a solid purple mate yeah I

2255
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:38,720
just want to see if I cuz I may it may

2256
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:40,429
make it recessive if I force too much

2257
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:44,119
purple into it may not come out till the

2258
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:45,350
f3 if I do that what's verbals I hope

2259
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:47,869
you guys pay attention to that that's

2260
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:49,870
random [ __ ] right there also another way

2261
01:40:47,869 --> 01:40:52,550
that I've been setting up these tents

2262
01:40:49,869 --> 01:40:54,890
with just one blower because it seemed

2263
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:58,640
it seems efficient if you're in a small

2264
01:40:54,890 --> 01:41:06,950
space I put the five by five hut with I

2265
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:09,410
do the blower right on top there I run

2266
01:41:06,949 --> 01:41:12,649
ducting into the hut and then around

2267
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:14,989
into the light fix the light reflector

2268
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:17,000
and then deducting out of the light

2269
01:41:14,989 --> 01:41:18,859
reflector to a carbon filter and the

2270
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,109
carbon filter is fun really high in the

2271
01:41:18,859 --> 01:41:23,000
hut as high as you can get so now you're

2272
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:24,500
filtering the air pulling out humidity

2273
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,229
and cooling your light all at one time

2274
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:29,149
and those work great in the garage right

2275
01:41:27,229 --> 01:41:34,579
now in Colorado in the winter you need a

2276
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:37,250
heater but if you've got two of those

2277
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:38,630
huts you could run them side-by-side and

2278
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,979
you convince that heat into the other

2279
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,720
hut from your light if you thought about

2280
01:41:39,979 --> 01:41:43,798
how to do

2282
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:49,899
sleeping plants emit co2 so if you move

2283
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,370
your dark the air from your sleeping

2284
01:41:49,899 --> 01:41:53,670
room into your awake room you were

moving co2 to a usable space

01:41:53,670 --> 01:42:12,670
that's a definite for people because we

2287
01:42:07,929 --> 01:42:14,560
have to travel with tanks but my

2288
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,359
argument because I am going to go to

2289
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,520
City Council when this comes up I'm

2290
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:20,769
gonna say this is available at the

2291
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:23,380
hydroponic store why can the guy growing

2292
01:42:20,770 --> 01:43:08,050
tomatoes or the guy growing orchids or

whatever else he's using there's so many

more dangerous things out there mica we

what's going on in our community and

like 60 degrees and within an hour it

was [ __ ] damn near freezing minus six

was cold the other night I was driving

home it was nicely cold at minus 6 it's

freaking cold right now man who's coming

up coming down like crazy

I'm from California dude winter killed

me Antarctica to get to school then when

these generations are getting softer as

2317

we go yeah we're talking about a doctor

2318
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:44,469
our good buddy Spence had his appendix

2319
01:44:42,969 --> 01:44:47,640
removed and Jesse was kind enough to

2320
01:44:44,469 --> 01:44:52,840
post a meme of a doctor removing his

2321
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:54,340
book that's pretty cute how many people

2322
01:44:52,840 --> 01:45:06,520
would just reach down and remove their

2323
01:44:54,340 --> 01:45:07,630
own appendix we're too entitled to say

2324
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:09,580
if you got a question

2325
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:17,170
I consider hydro hot like a champ I can

2326
01:45:09,579 --> 01:46:27,579
give you a lot of advice on that hung up

2327
01:45:17,170 --> 01:46:29,800
there too the other one up there those

2328
01:46:27,579 --> 01:46:31,869
are great I think instead of a big wide

2329
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:34,600
reflector a little reflector is better

2330
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:36,250
because you can make a sexual joke out

2331
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:42,130
of this if you want but I want it to go

2332
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:44,198
deeper I don't want it so wide you get

2333
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,609
better penetration yeah yeah I want more

2334
01:46:44,198 --> 01:46:48,210
penetration I don't need you tearing it

2335
01:46:45,609 --> 01:46:50,738
apart so wide go deeper it's still I

2336
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:53,079
mean you got a thousand watts a thousand

2337
01:46:50,738 --> 01:46:55,329
watts so if your reflector spreading it

2338
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:57,010
out to a five by five area or you have a

2339
01:46:55,329 --> 01:47:00,760
reflector spreading it out to three by

2340
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:02,469
three area which you know reflector

2341
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,449
you'll get a better value for that

2342
01:47:02,469 --> 01:47:05,948
thousand Watts worth and in my opinion

2343
01:47:04,448 --> 01:47:08,439
it's gonna be the three by three every

2344
01:47:05,948 --> 01:47:09,759
time absolutely hittin those huts those

2345
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:11,169
huts are very well made with that

2346
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,560
reflective material in there they're

2347
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:13,539
great

2348
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,990
I feel like I get a lot more lumens out

2349
01:47:13,539 --> 01:47:21,180
of those huts than I do the open road

2350
01:47:15,989 --> 01:47:24,039
for sure they take better pictures to

2351
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:25,150
background in there alright so most of

2352
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:27,189
this is the same if you're working a

2353
01:47:25,149 --> 01:47:30,429
bedroom or a closet just on a smaller

2354
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:31,960
scale if you can't cut holes for ducting

2355
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:46,450
try using a window we kind of talked

2356
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:51,060
about tricking on the windows actually I

2357
01:47:46,449 --> 01:47:51,059
use a premade inch flange

everywhere oh yeah blue when you cut

2362
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:27,130
that blue foam board it's gonna make a

2363
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:28,720
gigantic foamy mess everywhere and it'll

2364
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:33,100
clog up your saws like nothing other

2365
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:36,010
yeah I think it's real hot disguise

2366
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:38,710
you're out ducks if you conduct it out

2367
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:40,570
of the attic or a chimney that's awesome

2368
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:42,909
you don't want your neighbors seeing

2369
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:44,829
it's minus-6 outside right now for my

2370
01:48:42,909 --> 01:48:50,079
heat is dumping outside I'm pretty sure

2371
01:48:44,829 --> 01:48:51,460
it's making steam even if it's 20

2372
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,590
degrees it'll probably make steam

2373
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:57,510
jumping into minus six so they can see

2374

your air coming out of your gross space

I used to run a cycle or to make sure

2376
01:49:34,789 --> 01:51:17,579
the lights go off and in the room if you

2377
01:49:43,500 --> 01:51:20,010
need to keep in mind my greenhouse I

2378
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:23,099
harvested all the plants right before it

2379
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:24,780
got freezing cold in it but I had a

2380
01:51:23,099 --> 01:51:28,349
couple containers with lettuce and

2381
01:51:24,779 --> 01:51:31,109
spinach and radish and onions and I'm

2382
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:50,489
super stoked with my little tiny heater

2383
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:51,868
my little greenhouse once everything is

2384
01:51:50,488 --> 01:51:52,979
cool then you can put plants in there

2385
01:51:51,868 --> 01:51:57,779
and you're gonna have to make a couple

2386
01:51:52,979 --> 01:51:59,428
of adjustments if you're just vegging

2387
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:00,658
you're fine you can tweak around with

2388
01:51:59,429 --> 01:52:02,130
your rooms while your vegging you're not

2389
01:52:00,658 --> 01:52:04,019
gonna piss the plants off too much as

2390
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:05,760
soon as you start flower you have to be

2391
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:07,619
really really careful with your photo

2392
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:28,560
periods that's your light cycle we call

2393
01:52:07,618 --> 01:52:42,839
that don't mess with your photo period

2394
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:44,310
keep that solid I didn't like to share

2395

stuff somebody was supposed to come I'm

2580
02:02:37,448 --> 02:02:40,149
not blaming anything on Jesse Jesse was

2581
02:02:39,099 --> 02:02:40,389
trying to make it he can't make it

2582
02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:42,728
tonight

2583
02:02:40,389 --> 02:02:50,559
unfortunately so had to kind of replay

2584
02:02:42,729 --> 02:02:54,579
in the show trying to get an electrician

2585
02:02:50,559 --> 02:02:55,840
to his new girl facility and tonight he

2586
02:02:54,578 --> 02:02:57,670
showed up and he called me I was like

2587
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:59,380
dude do that so they know how hard it is

2588
02:02:57,670 --> 02:03:00,578
to get an electrician to your facility

2589
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,380
and once he's there you're paying him

2590
02:03:00,578 --> 02:03:03,458
and it's hard to get him there so just

2591
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:05,650
keep him there and get the work done so

2592
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:07,359
Jesse had to take a rain check if he can

2593
02:03:05,649 --> 02:03:08,558

2596
02:03:11,769 --> 02:03:14,739
enough to host another party at hydro

2597
02:03:13,479 --> 02:03:16,958
last night we'll talk about that a

2598
02:03:14,738 --> 02:03:18,189
little bit I need to before I even

2599
02:03:16,958 --> 02:03:20,050
forget before I have a chance to forget

2600
02:03:18,189 --> 02:03:22,299
I need to give a huge shout-out to Nano

2601
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:26,288
Lux lighting and hydro indoor growing

2602
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:28,329
supplies just looked over across the

2603
02:03:26,288 --> 02:03:32,109
room here there is a brand new pretty

2604
02:03:28,328 --> 02:03:33,788
new toy do dual-ended bulb and a ballast

2605
02:03:32,109 --> 02:03:36,308
and reflector all attached into one

2606
02:03:33,788 --> 02:03:40,208
piece it's the new nano luxe 1,000 watt

2607
02:03:36,309 --> 02:03:42,010
it actually has a 1200 watt setting on

2608
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:43,538
it so I'm gonna be cranking 1200 watts

2609
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:45,248
in one section and we're gonna see what

2610
02:03:43,538 --> 02:03:45,728
that light does they gave it to me to

2611
02:03:45,248 --> 02:03:47,708
run it

2612
02:03:45,729 --> 02:03:49,420
I said run a couple cycles let us know

2613
02:03:47,708 --> 02:03:51,908
what you think and we'll talk about the

2614
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:54,609
future so if that works out nano looks

2615
02:03:51,908 --> 02:03:57,819
maybe a podcast sponsor in the future

2616
02:03:54,609 --> 02:03:59,469
here really really cool new toy I can't

2617
02:03:57,819 --> 02:04:02,078
wait to see what she does yeah me too

2618
02:03:59,469 --> 02:04:04,300
fancy looking light for sure it is it's

2619
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:06,639
one of the the dual ended bulbs and it's

2620
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:08,260
the kind that's got the ballast and it's

2621
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:09,880
got a short reflector and I kind of like

2622
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:11,860
it it's got it all in one piece and it

2623
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:15,970
all hangs from the ceiling it's only

2624
02:04:11,859 --> 02:04:17,559
thee is it 240 or 220 it's only the 240

2625
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:18,820
I always get that one confused sorry I'm

2626
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:19,990
not good with my remember that many

2627
02:04:18,819 --> 02:04:22,059
goddamn numbers they messed with my

2628
02:04:19,989 --> 02:04:23,829
brain but I have a good feeling about

2629
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:24,880
that I've heard a lot of good stuff they

2630
02:04:23,829 --> 02:04:26,079
gave it to me because they know I'm

2631
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:28,390
gonna kick ass with it and see what it

2632
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:29,890
does I probably should have asked before

2633
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:42,280
I touch but that's one of the first

2634
02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:44,289

02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:59,650
what do you guys talk about something

2777
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:01,840
chaotic we um we went there and I mean

2778
02:09:59,649 --> 02:10:04,149
we were looking he was looking for a rig

2779
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:05,860
but they had tons of little tiny rigs I

2780
02:10:04,149 --> 02:10:07,479
mean little tiny miniature cakes like

2781
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:09,939
his Phase two over there that was I mean

2782
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:14,829
maybe this big the smaller shake you

2783
02:10:09,939 --> 02:10:18,129
know for only you know not three inches

2784
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:19,840
maybe two and a half but compared to

2785
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:22,210
what we have here locally in town you

2786
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,130
know it was it was definitely had more

2787
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:26,829
selection they just had [ __ ] crammed in

2788
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:28,560
cases like it merely had room you know

2789
02:10:26,829 --> 02:10:31,449
but there was definitely selection and

2790
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,670
anything that you could imagine so it

2791
02:10:31,449 --> 02:10:35,920
was definitely a cool place met a

2792
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:38,649
friendly dude in there that was you know

2793
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:42,430
he was talkative and he had some some

2794
02:10:38,649 --> 02:10:43,779
golden goat or something was it goat or

2795
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:45,909
was it yeah it's golden goat hash

2796
02:10:43,779 --> 02:10:46,899
alright you know we have anything to do

2797
02:10:45,909 --> 02:10:50,489
with the store though so don't go

2798
02:10:46,899 --> 02:10:50,489
expecting so okay well I didn't know it

2799
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:56,670
we're trying to be social I've never

2800
02:10:54,029 --> 02:10:58,618
known any place that can fix a broken

2801
02:10:56,670 --> 02:11:00,480
piece before you break a piece it's gone

2802
02:10:58,618 --> 02:11:06,899
say goodbye Barry that's not good and

2803
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:09,448
this looks brand new people so a little

2804
02:11:06,899 --> 02:11:12,058
bit but the price they charged me I was

2805
02:11:09,448 --> 02:11:14,460
blown away at how cheap it was as far as

2806
02:11:12,059 --> 02:11:15,989
I'm concerned it's a miracle they made

2807
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,788
me drop know this was the thing before

2808
02:11:15,988 --> 02:11:21,569
they made me drop a deposit on it which

2809
02:11:17,788 --> 02:11:23,309
was cheap but you paid the deposit to

2810
02:11:21,569 --> 02:11:24,808
have it repaired they repair it and if

2811
02:11:23,309 --> 02:11:27,420
they break it when it's getting repaired

2812
02:11:24,809 --> 02:11:30,210
you get 30% off the rig of your choice

2813
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:31,349
of the store oh nice yeah my voice will

2814
02:11:30,210 --> 02:11:33,000
come back I sound weird cuz I just took

2815
02:11:31,349 --> 02:11:33,989
a DAB I'm all choked up try to get this

2816
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,229
dad going for Adam

2817
02:11:33,988 --> 02:11:40,379
so it was wider here correct and now

2818
02:11:37,229 --> 02:11:42,750
it's thinner right there just like that

2819
02:11:40,380 --> 02:11:44,760
yeah it looks like they cut it off right

2820
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:46,649
at the top of because I broke it right

2821
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:48,210
where the new joint the line is I broke

2822
02:11:46,649 --> 02:11:50,519
it right the old one broke right there

2823
02:11:48,210 --> 02:11:56,158
anyway so they just clean it up and put

2824
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:57,900
a new one on nice and clean like Mike's

2825

I've had this set aside for a little

2834
02:12:25,948 --> 02:12:29,819
while there's a reason I had some of the

2835
02:12:28,738 --> 02:12:33,149
sour grapes

2836
02:12:29,819 --> 02:12:36,840
and it was some of the better shatter

2837
02:12:33,149 --> 02:12:39,929
that I've tasted here so big shout out

oxygen scuba gear just to do a podcast

2844
02:12:48,448 --> 02:12:50,988

we've all been there

2846
02:12:53,488 --> 02:13:13,689

2847
02:12:58,569 --> 02:13:15,849
day of Herson I don't know if you'd add

2848
02:13:13,689 --> 02:13:29,019
much at all or with people at all you

2849
02:13:15,850 --> 02:13:31,150
see quickly as well you sound like this

2850
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:34,570
on the radio yep you sound like you

2851
02:13:31,149 --> 02:13:35,979
should be our radio host for radio sir

2852
02:13:34,569 --> 02:13:39,639
all right let's bring this meeting to

2853
02:13:35,979 --> 02:13:41,289
order so we talked a little bit about

2854
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:42,850
the meeting Mike was kind enough to show

2855
02:13:41,289 --> 02:13:55,539
up to the Gros meeting hosted by hydro

2856
02:13:42,850 --> 02:13:59,920
indoor growing supplies last night Engel

2857
02:13:55,539 --> 02:14:03,340
then then lesson time yeah but I liked

2858
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:04,930
that it was nice the lesson was I think

2859
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:06,489
I realized about halfway through that

2860
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:08,380
most of us were probably able to do

2861
02:14:06,488 --> 02:14:10,448
everything that Jesse was teaching but

2862
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:13,510
I'm glad he took that as his first

2863
02:14:10,448 --> 02:14:15,429
teaching opportunity because he was good

2864
02:14:13,510 --> 02:14:18,070
now dude he's learning and he's catching

2865
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:19,869
up being on this podcast has really made

2866
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:21,399
him a better speaker so he's able to do

2867
02:14:19,869 --> 02:14:23,619
that I think the next couple of lessons

2868
02:14:21,399 --> 02:14:26,109
Jesse's gonna really crush it I picked a

2869
02:14:23,619 --> 02:14:27,969
bad spot like my if I tried to watch

2870
02:14:26,109 --> 02:14:30,579
Jesse while he was talking I would have

2871
02:14:27,969 --> 02:14:34,300
been watching his back so I was watching

2872
02:14:30,579 --> 02:14:37,329
everyone else watch Jesse and I mean

2873
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:39,400
cloning isn't complicated but he went

2874
02:14:37,329 --> 02:14:41,590
over all the steps real quick and at one

2875
02:14:39,399 --> 02:14:46,750
point everybody in the room pretty much

2876
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:48,460
went oh yeah and took a second to pull

2877
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:50,770
their phone out or grab a pen and jot

2878
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:52,869
down a little note like I should use

2879
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:55,570
this product or I'm keeping it too wet

2880
02:14:52,869 --> 02:14:57,579
or too dry or over underwater inner I

2881
02:14:55,569 --> 02:15:00,609
mean just little simple stuff it was

2882
02:14:57,579 --> 02:15:02,029
definitely the little talk afterward the

2883
02:15:00,609 --> 02:15:03,439
fine-tuning talked about

2884
02:15:02,029 --> 02:15:04,550
you're probably over-watering if that's

2885
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:05,868
what you're doing you're probably under

2886
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:07,880
watering that's what was cool that's

2887
02:15:05,868 --> 02:15:09,288
what was really valuable after that but

02:16:06,889 --> 02:16:10,969
it was a little chilly bro

2918

know we're doing this isn't our Forte we

2945
02:17:10,909 --> 02:17:13,609

2946
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:14,341
Jessie designed taking credit for

2947
02:17:13,609 --> 02:17:17,131
nothing

2948
02:17:14,341 --> 02:17:18,631
Jessie did all of this he decided that

2949
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:21,529
this needed to happen so he's learning

2950
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:23,909

2986
02:18:47,909 --> 02:18:52,770
of stuff as I read genetics that's me

2987
02:18:50,309 --> 02:18:54,389
look there that like really honestly

2988
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:55,979
won't get hung until December I've got a

2989
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:56,519
crop that's growing in the room where

2990
02:18:55,979 --> 02:18:58,439
that will go

2991
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:00,001
then when that crop finishes that light

2992
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:02,819
will go up and it will start under there

2993
02:19:00,001 --> 02:19:05,791
and if it kicks as much as it appears if

2994
02:19:02,819 --> 02:19:07,800
it you know as it looks you'll be in the

2995
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:08,429
shop buying three more of them here come

2996
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:11,069
March

2997
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:12,659
I'll buy four more my only concern is

2998
02:19:11,069 --> 02:19:14,671
venting those don't match up with my

2999
02:19:12,659 --> 02:19:17,190
finding style so I can only run those in

3000
02:19:14,671 --> 02:19:18,659
the wind very true but I can you know if

3001
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:20,551
they kick as much asses people have been

3002
02:19:18,659 --> 02:19:21,869
saying I can readjust my rooms all I

3003
02:19:20,550 --> 02:19:22,629
have to do is change air conditioning

3004
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:24,070
right

3005
02:19:22,629 --> 02:19:25,959
I could just go change up a little bit

3006
02:19:24,069 --> 02:19:28,449
couldn't you just shorten the pipes and

3007
02:19:25,959 --> 02:19:30,909
kind of ducked out from the main room

3008
02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:33,760
from top and filter into the bottom you

3009
02:19:30,909 --> 02:19:35,409
know cool air in hot air out but the

3010
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,610
lights are burning our ducted so the

3011
02:19:35,409 --> 02:19:38,049
heat from the lights I'm running now

3012
02:19:36,610 --> 02:19:40,389
doesn't ever make it to the room and

3013
02:19:38,049 --> 02:19:44,079
those are not ducted it's the only only

3014
02:19:40,388 --> 02:19:46,000
downside that I'm seeing right now one

3015
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:48,370
unit which I've never seen before the

3016
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,260
ballast and the delight is all usually

3017
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:52,689
separate and this is all one solid

3018
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:54,280
really well built you really see it

3019
02:19:52,689 --> 02:19:55,960
looks like it's well bells much lighter

3020
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:58,120
than it looks also it looks like it's

3021
02:19:55,959 --> 02:20:00,909
heavy as hell but it's really light nice

3022
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:05,770

to grow supplies hydro gotta catch up

3033
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:32,409
with myself hydro is running a special

3034
02:20:30,398 --> 02:20:33,879
for the podcast listeners when you check

3035
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:35,889
out at Highgrove tell them you listen to

3036
02:20:33,879 --> 02:20:37,599
the hydro culture podcast and they will

3037
02:20:35,889 --> 02:20:39,369
give you commercial pricing on your

3038
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:41,290
entire purchase

3039
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:43,060
that's so cool that's a sweet deal I was

3040
02:20:41,290 --> 02:20:45,189
talking about it the other night I uh I

3041
02:20:43,059 --> 02:20:46,420
bought a bag of dirt that bag of dirt

3042
02:20:45,189 --> 02:20:49,030
that you see part of it on the ground

3043
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:50,799
there that bag of dirt is a twenty five

3044
02:20:49,030 --> 02:20:52,720
dollar bag of dirt I paid about eighteen

3045
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:55,029
seventeen dollars and some jingles some

3046
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:56,920
change in there for that bag of dirt out

3047
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:59,470
the door because I paid commercial

3048
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:01,120
pricing that's a hell of a deal if we

3049
02:20:59,469 --> 02:21:03,670
pay what the dispensaries pay is what

3050
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:04,990
our pricing is if you use that that code

3051
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:10,689
if you tell them I listen to the hydro

02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:35,260
feet

3063
02:21:32,828 --> 02:21:37,389
dude weighs a hundred and forty pounds

3064
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:39,699
now he's about six he's somewhere

3065
02:21:37,389 --> 02:21:40,090
between 64 and 65 depending on who you

3066
02:21:39,699 --> 02:21:41,770
ask

3067
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:43,930
I never run into people taller than me

3068
02:21:41,770 --> 02:21:46,420
he's one of the few yeah and he's a

3069
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:48,309
hundred and forty pounds dude so you

3070
02:21:46,420 --> 02:21:50,228
guys send him some calories if you can

3071
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:51,879
mentally put calories on my brother

3072
02:21:50,228 --> 02:21:53,799
spent just send them right to him

3073
02:21:51,879 --> 02:22:00,068
because he needs some help right now I

3074
02:21:53,799 --> 02:22:06,188
feel it because you know he's back home

3075
02:22:00,068 --> 02:22:07,959
that's the secret look for that maybe

3076
02:22:06,189 --> 02:22:09,689
what I'm wishing he knows what I mean

3077
02:22:07,959 --> 02:22:15,459
well the secret cup is coming up it's

3078
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:18,090
coming out of the finals and you think

3079
02:22:15,459 --> 02:22:19,959
no I don't think about December 15

3080
02:22:18,090 --> 02:22:21,068
because that's a brown one he'll be back

3081
02:22:19,959 --> 02:22:22,509
I predict you know I'm just guessing

3082
02:22:21,068 --> 02:22:24,129
being hypothetical here but the second

3083
02:22:22,510 --> 02:22:25,180
week of December may be the beginning of

3084
02:22:24,129 --> 02:22:26,469
the third week of December you think

3085
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:29,619
right here in Mike's chair you think

3086
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:30,148
we'll have the secret cup winner garden

3087
02:22:29,619 --> 02:22:32,529
of Weeden

3088
02:22:30,148 --> 02:22:34,269
lovely lady Madi sitting right next to

3089
02:22:32,529 --> 02:22:37,560
us right here if you do can I be in the

3090
02:22:34,270 --> 02:22:37,560
chair that's behind the dad stuff

3091
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:44,139
sometimes people sit in and there's no

3092
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:47,229
mic the mic sits right here next to me I

3093
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:49,269
could fire this mic up but it's got a

3094
02:22:47,228 --> 02:22:52,599
droopy stand from what I understand it

3095
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:55,029
does but we just that sometimes people

3096
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:57,939
don't want to be heard and they just sit

3097
02:22:55,029 --> 02:22:59,020
on the podcast and just watch and then

3098
02:22:57,939 --> 02:23:00,309
I've looked them in the eye when I do

3099
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:10,630
the intro and stuff and I have someone

3100
02:23:00,309 --> 02:23:12,158
to talk to in the podcast world when

3101
02:23:10,629 --> 02:23:14,108
you're doing a microphone and you got

3102
02:23:12,158 --> 02:23:16,299
you got a voice going like the energy

3103
02:23:14,109 --> 02:23:17,649
sometimes you fail there was a night one

3104
02:23:16,299 --> 02:23:19,568
night when Adam and I say her for

3105
02:23:17,648 --> 02:23:21,010
probably 45 minutes just going so

3106
02:23:19,568 --> 02:23:23,109
welcome to the [ __ ] show we are

3107
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:26,020
failing miserably with a rhythm and a

3108
02:23:23,109 --> 02:23:27,488
conversation and a lesson and you should

3109
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:29,140
probably fast-forward through the rest

3110
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:31,500
of this show because tonight is not our

3111
02:23:29,139 --> 02:23:33,059
flow episode 12

3112
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:34,559
how it fell we pulled it off eventually

3113
02:23:33,059 --> 02:23:35,750
through the magic of editing and a lot

3114
02:23:34,559 --> 02:23:42,930
of dabs

3115
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:42,930
[Music]

3116
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:58,479

3120
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:35,790
so how much wrap that up in quite

3121
02:24:27,629 --> 02:24:37,289
quickly and local news for most of what

3122
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:39,180
we're doing here this is fir this is

3123
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:41,520
happening at my town and in my County so

3124
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:44,760
this is very pertinent to me I'm a

3125
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,500
grower I've got a home grow I grow my

3126
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:48,239
personal medicine here in my house I do

3127
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:49,350
some small stuff in my home because

3128
02:24:48,239 --> 02:24:51,629
that's what we do

3129
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:54,450
it's Colorado everything has to happen

3130
02:24:51,629 --> 02:24:56,219
in a large facility I am high Oh Mike's

3131
02:24:54,450 --> 02:25:00,380
medical marijuana provider and his

3132
02:24:56,219 --> 02:25:03,090
caregiver is happening pertains to Mike

3133
02:25:00,379 --> 02:25:08,129
they're trying to enforce rules upon me

3134
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:09,690
and my grow that will it's gonna it's

3135
02:25:08,129 --> 02:25:10,859
gonna [ __ ] with Mike's medicine supply

3136
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:12,510
I've been trying to find a classier way

3137
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:14,069
to say that but it's gonna hinder my

3138
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:16,350
production of Mike's quality medicine

3139
02:25:14,069 --> 02:25:17,819
and Mike relies on me for medicine so

3140
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:19,590
Mike is going to City Council I'll keep

3141
02:25:17,819 --> 02:25:20,850
cutting me off but I'm good Mike is

3142
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:22,530
going to City Council to make sure this

3143
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:23,220
doesn't happen so this is super

3144
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:25,200
important to me

3145
02:25:23,219 --> 02:25:26,489
this [ __ ] could happen in your area and

3146
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,990
someone's got to stand up and do what

3147
02:25:26,489 --> 02:25:29,670
Mike does so if you're doing that I give

3148
02:25:27,989 --> 02:25:30,869
you a huge shout out I'm gonna turn it

3149
02:25:29,670 --> 02:25:31,979
over to Mike for a couple minutes tell

3150
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:34,350
me what you learned at City Council

3151
02:25:31,979 --> 02:25:36,840
recently all right down here in Pueblo

3152
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:39,239
Colorado they're looking at passing home

3153
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:41,280
girl rules in the city and in the county

3154
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:43,170
it's two very separate efforts you have

3155
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:46,439
to go to two very separate meeting

3156
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:49,620
to be involved with this process right

3157
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:51,600
now the Planning and Zoning Department

3158
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,520
with the city has finalized their

3159
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:55,590
proposal they're sending that

3160
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:58,590
recommendation on to City Council city

3161
02:25:55,590 --> 02:26:00,180
council will receive it I expect that to

3162
02:25:58,590 --> 02:26:02,880
happen at their first meeting in

3163
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:04,620
December that's December 8th and then

3164
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:07,978
their final meeting in December on

3165
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:10,140
December 22nd they'll be taking or

3166
02:26:07,978 --> 02:26:13,559
they'll likely be taking public comment

3167
02:26:10,139 --> 02:26:15,420
and a vote on these proposed home grill

3168
02:26:13,559 --> 02:26:17,789
rules that will essentially limit every

3169
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:19,829
caregiver in Pueblo they're really

3170
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:23,220
really ugly rules folks you want to get

3171
02:26:19,829 --> 02:26:26,309
down and down to City Council on the

3172
02:26:23,219 --> 02:26:29,188
22nd and speak out against these rules

3173
02:26:26,309 --> 02:26:30,840
for sure they're also doubt in the

3174
02:26:29,189 --> 02:26:33,439
county that meeting is going to be

3175
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:36,750
taking place on December 10th at 9 a.m.

3176
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:38,489

whole lot of them they don't make a

3192
02:27:26,129 --> 02:27:30,889
whole lot of sense I'm doing a whole

3193
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:32,880
bunch of private lobbying trying to

3194
02:27:30,889 --> 02:27:34,500
example of a couple of the stupid rules

3195
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:37,829
they're trying to put out there banning

3196
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:38,959
all co2 usage in any sort of marijuana

3197
02:27:37,829 --> 02:27:40,850
grow room but the

3198
02:27:38,959 --> 02:27:43,639
they write that rule I mean it's dumb

3199
02:27:40,850 --> 02:27:45,260
just on its face but the way it's

3200
02:27:43,639 --> 02:27:46,969
written would make it illegal to take

3201
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:49,010
the SodaStream machine I have in my

3202
02:27:46,969 --> 02:27:51,969
kitchen into a grow room and use it I

3203
02:27:49,010 --> 02:27:54,200
think that's a special new crime now

3204
02:27:51,969 --> 02:27:57,739
that's a rule that I find ridiculous

3205
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:59,930
because there are people too he's

3206
02:27:57,739 --> 02:28:03,619
talking about co2 for co2 augmentation

3207
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:05,450
we run co2 in grow rooms because the co2

3208
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:06,860
plants would thrive with more co2 than

3209
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:08,630
what's naturally available in the

3210
02:28:06,860 --> 02:28:10,430
atmosphere in your natural girlier

3211
02:28:08,629 --> 02:28:11,899
probably have about three to five

3212
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:14,750
hundred probably right around four

3213
02:28:11,899 --> 02:28:17,389
hundred particles per million of co2 if

3214
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:18,709
you go to the hydro shop they'll set you

3215
02:28:17,389 --> 02:28:20,420
up with the system where you can get

3216
02:28:18,709 --> 02:28:23,239
about it would be cool if you could get

3217
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:24,920
about 1,200 to 1,800 PPM's of co2 in the

3218
02:28:23,239 --> 02:28:26,569
room what that does is your plants

3219
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:28,489
breathe back and they grow much more

3220
02:28:26,569 --> 02:28:30,829
vigorously and get bigger bud to get

3221
02:28:28,489 --> 02:28:33,978
denser bud to get larger plants and it

3222
02:28:30,829 --> 02:28:36,440
makes them grow more quickly so tomato

3223
02:28:33,978 --> 02:28:41,599
growers use this all kinds of indoor

3224
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:43,310
plant growers use all of these rules are

3225
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:45,470
written so that they could easily be

3226
02:28:43,309 --> 02:28:47,930
applied to anybody doing the same thing

3227
02:28:45,469 --> 02:28:49,819
with something that's not cannabis but

3228
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:51,559
it's all cannabis specific so they don't

3229
02:28:49,819 --> 02:28:54,559
make a lot of sense hopefully the City

3230
02:28:51,559 --> 02:28:56,930
Council will see how much nonsense this

3231
02:28:54,559 --> 02:28:58,519
is and kill it on and send the whole

3232
02:28:56,930 --> 02:29:00,260
matter back to Planning and Zoning for a

3233
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:02,090
redo but I just think it's done that

3234
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:03,710
they pick out co2 because the tomato

3235
02:29:02,090 --> 02:29:05,059
farmer can go to the hydro shop and buy

3236
02:29:03,709 --> 02:29:06,978
it and take it to his house and run in

3237
02:29:05,059 --> 02:29:08,029
the basement just like just like Adam

3238
02:29:06,978 --> 02:29:09,829
would in his basement grow just like

3239
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:13,880
Mike wouldn't his basement grow just

3240
02:29:09,829 --> 02:29:17,659
like they heard something that sounded

3241
02:29:13,879 --> 02:29:20,359
scary and so they wrote a rule that says

3242
02:29:17,659 --> 02:29:21,739
you can't do that and because they don't

3243
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:23,569
know what they're talking about and the

3244
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:24,799
research didn't get done a lot of the

3245
02:29:23,569 --> 02:29:26,719
rules don't make sense

3246
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:28,849
I mean I've described it to other people

3247
02:29:26,719 --> 02:29:31,549
is like listening to a five-year-old

3248
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:33,110
lecture on calculus it doesn't matter

3249
02:29:31,549 --> 02:29:36,439
how much homework they did the night

3250
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:38,479
before but the the lecture will be total

3251
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:40,489
nonsense from start to finish and anyone

3252
02:29:38,478 --> 02:29:43,609
not throwing rocks is doing so out of

3253
02:29:40,489 --> 02:29:47,299
being polite I think it's just painful

3254
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:50,239
the last time we went to of the council

3255
02:29:47,299 --> 02:29:51,489
at least seemed to be I won't say pro

3256
02:29:50,239 --> 02:29:53,590
pot but

3257
02:29:51,489 --> 02:29:55,959
not against it definitely like I

3258
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:58,079
wouldn't see anyone our council is Pro

3259
02:29:55,959 --> 02:30:02,739
pop but there are some that are

3260
02:29:58,079 --> 02:30:04,450
interested in what you know you're still

3261
02:30:02,739 --> 02:30:06,670
there's still the minority of the vote

3262
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:08,471
it's not flying for sure which is why I

3263
02:30:06,670 --> 02:30:09,790
keep bringing it this is mod cast

3264
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:12,060
because people need to show up to these

3265
02:30:09,790 --> 02:30:14,681
meetings and start pitching in if

3266
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:16,720
Planning and Zoning z' work on the

3267
02:30:14,681 --> 02:30:19,360
marijuana rules is indicative of their

3268
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:20,859
work on other rules that might be an

3269
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:23,319
explanation and the why nothing works

3270
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:25,150
here like it might just be that nobody's

3271
02:30:23,319 --> 02:30:27,549
paid attention to government for so long

3272
02:30:25,149 --> 02:30:30,250
that note like they don't expect to get

3273
02:30:27,549 --> 02:30:31,989
caught just doing nonsense a lot of

3274
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:34,510
people aren't aware that we can just go

3275
02:30:31,989 --> 02:30:36,399
to City Council and sign up and sit at

3276
02:30:34,510 --> 02:30:38,950
that little cozy chair with a microphone

3277
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:40,479
dude it's cushy it feels they make they

3278
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:41,829
kind of it's intimidating if you're not

3279
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:44,140
that kind of person but the one the

3280
02:30:41,829 --> 02:30:46,209
first time you go I feel like I could go

3281
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:47,979
now if I had some real business to go

3282
02:30:46,209 --> 02:30:50,439
deal with I could I could go speak there

3283
02:30:47,979 --> 02:31:04,060
it's inviting anybody can go you can go

3284
02:30:50,440 --> 02:31:05,681
totally under there I can't see his

3285
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:09,760
pants but his shoes are definitely muddy

3286
02:31:05,681 --> 02:31:11,560
is so but dude you're invited to go talk

3287
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:13,000
in City Council you can speak and nobody

3288
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:17,250
will judge you they'll listen to what

3289
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:19,510
you have to say they may judge you judge

3290
02:31:17,250 --> 02:31:22,479
one person for a few minutes and it was

3291
02:31:19,510 --> 02:31:24,190
almost entertaining but you can go speak

3292
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:26,859
and you can say your piece and you get I

3293
02:31:24,190 --> 02:31:29,290
think five full solid minutes and these

3294
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:31,210
except during public comment they give

3295
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:33,101
anyone who wants to come and sign up

3296
02:31:31,209 --> 02:31:34,869
five four minutes to speak on anything

3297
02:31:33,101 --> 02:31:36,579
they'd like to and this happens in every

3298
02:31:34,870 --> 02:31:38,380
city if you've got a city hall that has

3299
02:31:36,579 --> 02:31:41,079
City Council meetings you can go and you

3300
02:31:38,379 --> 02:31:42,819
can even if it's something that one guy

3301
02:31:41,079 --> 02:31:46,510
came and talked for six minutes about

3302
02:31:42,819 --> 02:31:48,010
the bike lane right and how to use them

3303
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:49,720
yeah I was gonna say it felt like he was

3304
02:31:48,010 --> 02:31:51,101
giving the City Council a lesson on how

3305
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:53,079
to use bike lanes but I think he was

3306
02:31:51,101 --> 02:31:55,540
asking for more funding to create more

3307
02:31:53,079 --> 02:31:57,190
bike lanes was his goal or information

3308
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:59,980
on how to use bike lane in these

3309
02:31:57,190 --> 02:32:02,800
meetings or poke at public broadcast

3310
02:31:59,979 --> 02:32:04,250
free to the public on like channel 16 or

3311
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:06,409
17 here locally

3312
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:09,020
and so he's trying to show the city how

3313
02:32:06,409 --> 02:32:10,879
to use these new bike lanes just he

3314
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:12,680
found out a freeway to get on TV and

3315
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:15,709
give a Pete a little educational spiel

3316
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:17,720
on bike lanes if you guys are against

3317
02:32:15,709 --> 02:32:19,699
something that's going or if you need

3318
02:32:17,719 --> 02:32:20,898
something that isn't happening to happen

3319
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:23,720
if you if you're not getting some good

3320
02:32:20,898 --> 02:32:25,068
recycling in your city go to City

3321
02:32:23,719 --> 02:32:26,959
Council be like hey we've done a lot of

3322
02:32:25,068 --> 02:32:28,068
trash we should work on some recycling

3323
02:32:26,959 --> 02:32:30,169
if that's your pet do whatever your

3324
02:32:28,068 --> 02:32:31,309
passion is our passion is cannabis so

3325
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:33,139
we're going to City Council and we're

3326
02:32:31,309 --> 02:32:34,488
saying cannabis a lot there's a young

3327
02:32:33,139 --> 02:32:37,010
woman who comes down and speaks on

3328
02:32:34,488 --> 02:32:39,170
roadside memorials all the time and I

3329
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:43,219
mean half the rooms in tears every time

3330
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:45,409
she speaks 30 seconds - are you for

3331
02:32:43,219 --> 02:32:47,299
against roadside memorials I honestly

3332
02:32:45,409 --> 02:32:49,700
don't care you don't care well that was

3333
02:32:47,299 --> 02:32:58,549
a quick 30 seconds Adam you know me I

3334
02:32:49,700 --> 02:33:02,510
don't care are they trash or they to me

3335
02:32:58,549 --> 02:33:06,500
it's something that to me no one's been

3336
02:33:02,510 --> 02:33:13,850
lost so it's hard for me to really your

3337
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:15,370
every culture has a way they more it's

3338
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:17,779
kind of intense

3339
02:33:15,370 --> 02:33:19,310
I don't know driving around and not

3340
02:33:17,779 --> 02:33:20,390
being used to roadside memorials cuz

3341
02:33:19,309 --> 02:33:22,398
it's not something you see all the time

3342
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:43,010
in Denver even though people have died

3343
02:33:22,398 --> 02:33:44,959
on every street corner don't expect to

3344
02:33:43,010 --> 02:33:48,889
vote for our president and he's gonna

3345
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:52,539
change cannabis laws your City Council

3346
02:33:48,889 --> 02:33:56,180
scary that you has to be cannabis

3347
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:58,340
cannabis pro cannabis and then you work

3348
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:59,840
from your City Council to your mayor and

3349
02:33:58,340 --> 02:34:02,420
you try to get that dude in office

3350
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:05,180
that's the way Colorado did it it didn't

3351
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:06,710
start it started in Denver and they

3352
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:08,809
decriminalized it and it worked out

3353
02:34:06,709 --> 02:34:12,318
words am i I mean this is just what I

3354
02:34:08,809 --> 02:34:14,090
know from looking outside anything

3355
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:15,590
political you definitely start local

3356
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:16,219
that's where you generate your base and

3357
02:34:15,590 --> 02:34:17,328
your

3358
02:34:16,219 --> 02:34:19,368
and that's what they're talking about

3359
02:34:17,328 --> 02:34:21,049
when they say grassroots political

3360
02:34:19,369 --> 02:34:22,520
effort is going door-to-door and saying

3361
02:34:21,049 --> 02:34:23,809
hey stranger what do you think about

3362
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:25,430
cannabis laws or whatever you're

3363
02:34:23,809 --> 02:34:27,228
passionate about and there's tons of

3364
02:34:25,430 --> 02:34:29,238
that here I mean a lot of people on a

3365
02:34:27,228 --> 02:34:30,858
national level to think of Colorado and

3366
02:34:29,238 --> 02:34:32,868
they think they've legalized medical

3367
02:34:30,859 --> 02:34:34,970
marijuana years and years ago they

3368
02:34:32,869 --> 02:34:37,159
legalized recreational marijuana the

3369
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:41,840
game's over that it's done they want

3370
02:34:37,158 --> 02:34:43,879
know it in a very real sense yes I was

3371
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:45,289
in line on January 1st with Jeff and

3372
02:34:43,879 --> 02:34:46,608
other people and there was a dance

3373
02:34:45,289 --> 02:34:48,319
people were doing on the way out of the

3374
02:34:46,609 --> 02:34:50,630
store that they just couldn't help I did

3375
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:52,728
it no one struts and dances and shimmies

3376
02:34:50,629 --> 02:34:57,438
through a parking lot on their way out

3377
02:34:52,728 --> 02:35:00,108
of Safeway I used to see Mike and I had

3378
02:34:57,439 --> 02:35:04,970
Mike was for a few brief days before we

3379
02:35:00,109 --> 02:35:06,859
got closed down boss at the only Medical

3380
02:35:04,969 --> 02:35:09,049
Marijuana Center in town I sold medical

3381
02:35:06,859 --> 02:35:11,328
cannabis over the counter for months and

3382
02:35:09,049 --> 02:35:15,068
I'm well-known for that around here the

3383
02:35:11,328 --> 02:35:18,288
first time or bliss is just something so

3384
02:35:15,068 --> 02:35:19,939
in January first after I was the first

3385
02:35:18,289 --> 02:35:21,260
person to buy recreational cannabis at

3386
02:35:19,939 --> 02:35:27,229
the greener side dispensary in Pueblo

3387
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:29,420
Colorado there was a camera guy there

3388
02:35:27,228 --> 02:35:31,129
hey man we're doing a documentary can

3389
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:32,238
you tell us can you say something good

3390
02:35:31,129 --> 02:35:33,618
when you walk out and I was like cool

3391
02:35:32,238 --> 02:35:35,689
watch this and I went right back in the

3392
02:35:33,619 --> 02:35:36,920
door and I came back out and I threw my

3393
02:35:35,689 --> 02:35:38,510
arms up in the air and I yelled just

3394
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:40,398
that I go my name is Rasta Jeff and I

3395
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:41,988
was the first person to buy recreational

3396
02:35:40,398 --> 02:35:45,728
cannabis at the greener side dispensary

3397
02:35:41,988 --> 02:35:45,728
in Pueblo Colorado and then I screamed

3398
02:35:46,328 --> 02:35:57,920
that was [ __ ] amazing film stuff that

3399
02:35:55,998 --> 02:36:00,559
they're gonna use every couple of weeks

3400
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:03,078
for the next hundred years that day it's

3401
02:36:00,559 --> 02:36:06,528
hilarious all right I just pulled up you

3402
02:36:03,078 --> 02:36:08,930
were talking reading so I was leading I

3403
02:36:06,529 --> 02:36:11,209
just once Colorado legalized marijuana

3404
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:13,100
the fight quickly became cities and

3405
02:36:11,209 --> 02:36:16,970
counties looking for fun ways to ban it

3406
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:19,998
again so yeah in a very real way we won

3407
02:36:16,969 --> 02:36:22,328
but in a very real way now we're making

3408
02:36:19,998 --> 02:36:24,289
the rules until after you pass forward

3409
02:36:22,328 --> 02:36:26,719
you know the whole world's watching

3410
02:36:24,289 --> 02:36:27,700
Colorado and Pueblo reports our tax

3411
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:30,340
numbers

3412
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:33,131
so in a very real way our tiny little

3413
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:35,319
town and would you say we get a lot of

3414
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:37,930
press excess traffic because we're like

3415
02:36:35,319 --> 02:36:40,659
the first stop we need a lot of every

3416
02:36:37,931 --> 02:36:42,670
kind of traffic yeah Plus on the way to

3417
02:36:40,659 --> 02:36:45,130
the rest of the us from every place out

3418
02:36:42,670 --> 02:36:49,479
there this used to be a stop on the

3419
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:56,709
Santa Fe Trail getting supplies or gas

3420
02:36:49,479 --> 02:37:01,449
here for very true dad awesome alright

3421
02:36:56,709 --> 02:37:06,869
we're gonna let's do uh I'm gonna see

3422
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:06,870
how long we've been into this holy crap

3423
02:37:08,579 --> 02:37:12,610
Mike always bringing the good news but I

3424
02:37:11,079 --> 02:37:14,649
just read news from the cannabis this

3425
02:37:12,610 --> 02:37:17,650
one's by Ricardo Baca this one's kind of

3426
02:37:14,649 --> 02:37:20,431
a neat article this shows to me this

3427
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:22,739
shows that things are evolving and the

3428
02:37:20,431 --> 02:37:25,659
America is starting to make changes

3429
02:37:22,739 --> 02:37:27,369
that's what I got from it so it's a

3430
02:37:25,659 --> 02:37:29,261
positive changes says marijuana

3431
02:37:27,370 --> 02:37:31,570
activists are plant are already planning

3432
02:37:29,261 --> 02:37:33,670
the 2016 campaign to regulate and

3433
02:37:31,569 --> 02:37:35,949
legalize the sale for recreational pot

3434
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:39,040
in Nevada home to Las Vegas one of the

3435
02:37:35,950 --> 02:37:40,271
world's biggest tourism destinations but

3436
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:42,311
some tourists won't have to wait that

3437
02:37:40,271 --> 02:37:45,670
long to legally buy weed in Las Vegas

3438
02:37:42,310 --> 02:38:04,750
thanks to the most legal reciprocity law

3439
02:37:45,670 --> 02:38:06,280
in the US I nailed that word alright

3440
02:38:04,750 --> 02:38:07,630
well Mike just said it for me so I'm

3441
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:08,860
just gonna point at Mike and he'll say

3442
02:38:07,630 --> 02:38:09,189
that word every time it comes up from

3443
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:11,319
now on

3444
02:38:09,190 --> 02:38:12,730
awesome medical marijuana card holders

3445
02:38:11,319 --> 02:38:15,341
throughout the US will be able to

3446
02:38:12,729 --> 02:38:18,130
purchase pot in Nevada starting in 2015

3447
02:38:15,341 --> 02:38:19,750
all they'll have to do is show their

3448
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:21,670
medical marijuana license show a

3449
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:23,620
government ID proving they're 21 or

3450
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:25,690
older and sign an affidavit and they'll

3451
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:27,870
have access to that shop but no others

3452
02:38:25,690 --> 02:38:29,310
for their stay in Nevada does

3453
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:31,500
that lead me to believe they only get

3454
02:38:29,310 --> 02:38:33,270
one stop when they go to Nevada that

3455
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:35,879
sounds like you got a pick it and stick

3456
02:38:33,271 --> 02:38:40,500
it homie pick one and stay with it

3457
02:38:35,879 --> 02:38:42,449
but how much are you allowed to prevent

3458
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:44,370
smurfing that's an odd way to do that

3459
02:38:42,450 --> 02:38:52,530
there you go

3460
02:38:44,370 --> 02:38:56,220
well this liberal medical across the

3461
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:58,110
word reciprocity Act as a act as a soft

3462
02:38:56,219 --> 02:38:59,760
lead to recreational measures in Nevada

3463
02:38:58,110 --> 02:39:02,340
and will Nevada pass full-on

3464
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:05,430
recreational legalization in 2016 of

3465
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:07,139
course it will said Jim Lamoreaux who

3466
02:39:05,430 --> 02:39:09,360
handles government relations at Colorado

3467
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:11,189
base pot testing facility can labs which

3468
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:12,659
recently announced its future present in

3469
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:15,090
Nevada's marijuana market

3470
02:39:12,659 --> 02:39:28,979
most people are factoring into their

3471
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:31,079
models people discussed it as part of

3472
02:39:28,979 --> 02:39:33,209
their model you can consider that Nevada

3473
02:39:31,079 --> 02:39:35,370
has fewer than 7,000 medical marijuana

3474
02:39:33,209 --> 02:39:37,020
patients it's not a very large base but

3475
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:38,730
when you factor in MMJ patients from

3476
02:39:37,021 --> 02:39:41,190
other states who might take advantage of

3477
02:39:38,729 --> 02:39:43,289
Nevada system another a hundred and ten

3478
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:45,601
thousand from Colorado five hundred and

3479
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:47,010
seventy thousand from California and a

3480
02:39:45,601 --> 02:39:49,140
hundred thousand from Washington

3481
02:39:47,010 --> 02:39:52,500
suddenly those numbers are looking a lot

3482
02:39:49,139 --> 02:39:54,239
better yeah not to mention if Missouri

3483
02:39:52,500 --> 02:40:00,810
goes legal this year which they're

3484
02:39:54,239 --> 02:40:02,879
talking about 2016 Michigan trying to do

3485
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:16,619
legalization this year as well what

3486
02:40:02,879 --> 02:40:18,869
happened Florida like you thought it I

3487
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:21,690
don't trust Florida's government to like

3488
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:24,030
give them say okay here's here's a full

3489
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:25,920
medical bill you can't do anything with

3490
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:27,870
it nothing can come in nothing can go

3491
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:30,510
out it's got to be all CBD here in

3492
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:33,100
Florida because we just got such bangin

3493
02:40:30,510 --> 02:40:36,380
medicine like New Jersey does

3494
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:38,689
you I mean you you were part of that

3495
02:40:36,379 --> 02:40:41,659
kind of argument yeah beginning and it I

3496
02:40:38,689 --> 02:40:43,460
stuck with it dude and that I'm sorry

3497
02:40:41,659 --> 02:40:45,139
man it and slow seven all kinds of

3498
02:40:43,459 --> 02:40:47,028
issues they they had CBD only

3499
02:40:45,139 --> 02:40:48,949
legislation before this recent medical

3500
02:40:47,029 --> 02:40:50,479
marijuana failure and right after the

3501
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:53,659
Medical Marijuana amendment failed the

3502
02:40:50,478 --> 02:40:57,228
judge tossed their CBD rules so they're

3503
02:40:53,659 --> 02:40:58,879
back to square [ __ ] sorry kids alright

3504
02:40:57,228 --> 02:41:01,039
so this article says giving patients the

3505
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:02,929
ability to legal legally access medical

3506
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,029
marijuana when they're visiting a legal

3507
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:06,829
medical marijuana state just makes sense

3508
02:41:05,029 --> 02:41:08,960
said Taylor West deputy director of the

3509
02:41:06,829 --> 02:41:10,639
National cannabis Industry Association a

3510
02:41:08,959 --> 02:41:12,559
national trade group for illegal

3511
02:41:10,639 --> 02:41:13,909
marijuana businesses and it makes even

3512
02:41:12,559 --> 02:41:15,829
more sense when you're talking about a

3513
02:41:13,909 --> 02:41:18,100
state that has such a huge number of out

3514
02:41:15,829 --> 02:41:20,659
of out-of-state visitors it's safer for

3515
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:24,559
patients and good for and about Nevada

3516
02:41:20,659 --> 02:41:26,750
businesses when when if that would

3517
02:41:24,559 --> 02:41:32,238
almost be like Florida you know like if

3518
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:37,579
you want medical dispensary right by

3519
02:41:32,238 --> 02:41:40,100
Disney World would crush from the

3520
02:41:37,579 --> 02:41:44,898
beginning is it's technically illegal

3521
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:46,430
and you can't travel I mean in

3522
02:41:44,898 --> 02:41:48,108
Washington you're not good anywhere else

3523
02:41:46,430 --> 02:41:49,700
yeah it's good now there's some

3524
02:41:48,109 --> 02:41:51,590
reciprocity and that's a beautiful thing

3525
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:54,579
you'll see me in Vegas name and I mean

3526
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:57,559
now look at all the events you know

3527
02:41:54,579 --> 02:41:58,659
secret cops gonna be way bigger 2015

3528
02:41:57,559 --> 02:42:02,389
that's all I'm saying

3529
02:41:58,659 --> 02:42:03,529
now five hundred tickets max keep it

3530
02:42:02,389 --> 02:42:06,799
small nice and private

3531
02:42:03,529 --> 02:42:12,020
I agree with that but I'd be impressed

3532
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:13,579
if they keep it to five hundred sure

3533
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:15,590
enough Vegas he's roughly forty million

3534
02:42:13,579 --> 02:42:17,148
visitors annually that's a lot of people

3535
02:42:15,590 --> 02:42:18,799
but how many of those tourists will have

3536
02:42:17,148 --> 02:42:19,969
valid medical marijuana cards and how

3537
02:42:18,799 --> 02:42:22,398
many of those patients will take the

3538
02:42:19,969 --> 02:42:24,769
time to seek legal Nevada weed we're

3539
02:42:22,398 --> 02:42:26,420
still talking Reagan rail relatively

3540
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:27,829
small numbers that Joe Hoda's chief

3541
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:30,620
marketing officer at Denver based

3542
02:42:27,829 --> 02:42:32,840
marijuana company Eddie uh sorry I read

3543
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:34,970
that way too quickly Dixie elixirs it's

3544
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:36,710
as if the it's not as if the average

3545
02:42:34,969 --> 02:42:38,898
tourist or consumer can show up and make

3546
02:42:36,709 --> 02:42:39,949
a purchase the red card act won't have

3547
02:42:38,898 --> 02:42:41,689
hey that's what they're calling it won't

3548
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:43,670
have huge a huge impact on their tourism

3549
02:42:41,689 --> 02:42:45,979
because it's a small number of people

3550
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:46,489
many of whom were probably already going

3551
02:42:45,978 --> 02:42:48,350
to Vegas

3552
02:42:46,489 --> 02:42:50,239
it might be a convenience but if I have

3553
02:42:48,351 --> 02:42:52,790
a red card I can already get my medicine

3554
02:42:50,239 --> 02:42:54,619
in my own state have a flying with it

3555
02:42:52,790 --> 02:42:56,181
could be sketchy sometimes yeah you can

3556
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:57,950
get it your own stay you just can't take

3557
02:42:56,181 --> 02:43:00,800
it with you the Vegas because you've got

3558
02:42:57,950 --> 02:43:02,990
to fly there or drive through Utah or

3559
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:05,659
New Mexico that sounds like you're legit

3560
02:43:02,989 --> 02:43:07,640
so when you get there because what

3561
02:43:05,659 --> 02:43:15,079
happens when it becomes under pressure

3562
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:16,940
it it like explodes or cool okay

3563
02:43:15,079 --> 02:43:18,409
everybody else can change your policies

3564
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:21,110
is except for the people that transport

3565
02:43:18,409 --> 02:43:22,340
everybody right pretty much okay Nevada

3566
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:25,730
does pass recreational marijuana

3567
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:28,159
measures in 2016 the election in the

3568
02:43:25,729 --> 02:43:29,810
2016 election the earliest the state

3569
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:33,619
will see those sales starting is late

3570
02:43:29,810 --> 02:43:35,629
2017 the 2018 is more likely until then

3571
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:36,980
companies such as Dixie which hopes to

3572
02:43:35,629 --> 02:43:38,659
soon have an agreement allowing the

3573
02:43:36,979 --> 02:43:40,850
state the sale of its cannabis infused

3574
02:43:38,659 --> 02:43:42,709
edibles drinks and topicals in Nevada

3575
02:43:40,851 --> 02:43:45,771
will have time to leave their mark on

3576
02:43:42,709 --> 02:43:49,789
the Las Vegas Strip I was gonna ask why

3577
02:43:45,771 --> 02:43:51,320
two years but after seeing what just

3578
02:43:49,790 --> 02:43:53,601
happened in Washington where they're so

3579
02:43:51,319 --> 02:43:55,340
unprepared for recreational I would

3580
02:43:53,601 --> 02:43:57,110
almost expect two years to be bright

3581
02:43:55,340 --> 02:44:00,351
about right yeah give him time to grow

3582
02:43:57,110 --> 02:44:02,569
summer get the rules in place get a

3583
02:44:00,351 --> 02:44:19,940
couple things in stock can like cure it

3584
02:44:02,569 --> 02:44:22,369
and the next thing is so guys we bragged

3585
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:23,690
about Adam and I bragged recently about

3586
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:26,310
a couple months ago about going to see

3587
02:44:23,690 --> 02:44:30,940
Joe Rogan shut up about it

3588
02:44:26,309 --> 02:44:33,739
[Music]

3589
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:35,420
Angela myself and Adam went and saw Joe

3590
02:44:33,739 --> 02:44:36,771
Rogan live at the Denver Comedy Works

3591
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:38,239
during the taping of his new special

3592
02:44:36,771 --> 02:44:41,030
that aired last night

3593
02:44:38,239 --> 02:44:42,920
and I DVR'd it Mike came over here and

3594
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:44,510
watched it with Angela and I Adam

3595
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:48,170
watched it is his place with his kind

3596
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:50,479
lady mm-hmm that was a funny damn comedy

3597
02:44:48,170 --> 02:44:52,639
special being without a lot we were

3598
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:59,279
there they cut out a walk

3599
02:44:52,639 --> 02:45:00,409
last night at I wish I had that quality

3600
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:03,659
of a video camera

3601
02:45:00,409 --> 02:45:05,340
the cameras were tiny the camera that

3602
02:45:03,659 --> 02:45:07,709
Rogan is staring into the majority of

3603
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:12,060
the time I'm sitting under like a lot of

3604
02:45:07,709 --> 02:45:14,479
the time it's a small thing like a LED

3605
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:19,469
screen display basically and that's it

3606
02:45:14,479 --> 02:45:30,750
it's cool it was a great comedy show to

3607
02:45:19,469 --> 02:45:32,760
end professional comedy works before

3608
02:45:30,750 --> 02:45:44,639
they do a professional comedy show like

3609
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:46,200
somebody TV wise big time there were so

3610
02:45:44,639 --> 02:45:47,819
many crowd rules they were moving the

3611
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:49,380
crowd around and putting ugly people in

3612
02:45:47,819 --> 02:45:50,610
the back and sexy people up front of

3613
02:45:49,379 --> 02:45:52,139
course we're under camera so you

3614
02:45:50,610 --> 02:45:53,970
couldn't even see us it was sort of

3615
02:45:52,139 --> 02:45:57,029
pointless I never saw a real good look

3616
02:45:53,969 --> 02:45:58,979
at this it was really dark the only

3617
02:45:57,030 --> 02:46:00,300
lights in the building were on the stage

3618
02:45:58,979 --> 02:46:01,829
and you couldn't even see the crowd so

3619
02:46:00,299 --> 02:46:03,779
all the moving around and all the rules

3620
02:46:01,829 --> 02:46:05,940
and the no hats and no logo [ __ ] was

3621
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:07,710
just too much attention we might have

3622
02:46:05,940 --> 02:46:09,060
applied if he had a 20 minute bid on

3623
02:46:07,709 --> 02:46:11,879
like picking on people in the front row

3624
02:46:09,060 --> 02:46:14,219
or some [ __ ] but oh I saw was the

3625
02:46:11,879 --> 02:46:15,839
profile of one kid a couple of times and

3626
02:46:14,219 --> 02:46:20,100
that's pretty much all the crowd use and

3627
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:21,510
that's where we were three seats off to

3628
02:46:20,101 --> 02:46:25,110
the side up on the top and that's where

3629
02:46:21,510 --> 02:46:27,180
nice see right next to Jeff Jeff was did

3630
02:46:25,110 --> 02:46:30,060
basically at the camera there was a guy

3631
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:32,101
sitting next to us but his they were

3632
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:35,489
still wheelchair accessible so it wasn't

3633
02:46:32,101 --> 02:46:37,110
sloped so he was up higher so that every

3634
02:46:35,489 --> 02:46:39,060
shot from across the way it basically

3635
02:46:37,110 --> 02:46:41,489
blocked us like completely out of there

3636
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:43,709
because we were underneath his shoulders

3637
02:46:41,489 --> 02:46:49,049
basically all the way down to his elbow

3638
02:46:43,709 --> 02:46:52,139
yeah give you five minutes to talk live

3639
02:46:49,049 --> 02:46:56,039
on television Joe Rogan doesn't have to

3640
02:46:52,139 --> 02:46:58,560
catch you in the side view great show on

3641
02:46:56,040 --> 02:47:00,480
TV for free all right so speaking of Joe

3642
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:01,619
Rogan being on a video shout out to Joe

3643
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:03,629
Rogan that show is great shot it's a

3644
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:05,490
comedy where explain goes big respect to

3645
02:47:03,629 --> 02:47:06,219
Melissa if you guys don't know Melissa

3646
02:47:05,489 --> 02:47:08,340
comedy works

3647
02:47:06,219 --> 02:47:11,139
you don't know what you're missing um

3648
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:13,870
let's see what else am I gonna say we

3649
02:47:11,139 --> 02:47:16,689
watched a culture high tonight I invited

3650
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:18,340
these dudes over I rented it from iTunes

3651
02:47:16,689 --> 02:47:19,809
which I've never rented anything from

3652
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:22,750
iTunes it feels kind of weird to pay

3653
02:47:19,809 --> 02:47:31,389
$4.99 to watch something for 24 hours on

3654
02:47:22,750 --> 02:47:33,969
my computer I learned a lot of stuff I

3655
02:47:31,389 --> 02:47:37,439
tried to take some notes we came to a

3656
02:47:33,969 --> 02:47:39,909
really easy conclusion [ __ ] Nancy Grace

3657
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:41,229
I can't believe I haven't said that yes

3658
02:47:39,909 --> 02:48:10,270
that's the only [ __ ] thing I wrote

3659
02:47:41,228 --> 02:48:12,340
down the culture hi it's worth watch

3660
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:14,350
your parents down have them watch it

3661
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:17,648
with you watch it as a family watch it

3662
02:48:14,350 --> 02:48:19,840
with your friends it's worth it give it

3663
02:48:17,648 --> 02:48:24,639
to someone that's maybe not open-minded

3664
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:26,260
but willing to listen that's all who's

3665
02:48:24,639 --> 02:48:31,750
one of your favorite speakers in there I

3666
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:41,079
did I forget how it's crazy he gets all

3667
02:48:31,750 --> 02:48:42,340
his message is true so it's it's there

3668
02:48:41,079 --> 02:48:46,840

I'm a huge fan of dr. Lester Grinspoon

3671
02:48:48,549 --> 02:48:53,738
and they're both heavy narrators in the

3672
02:48:50,950 --> 02:49:01,140
beginning Ed Burns the guy that did the

3673
02:48:53,738 --> 02:49:03,728
wire is dr. Lester Grinspoon life's

3674
02:49:01,139 --> 02:49:06,278
life-changing books on cannabis one of

3675
02:49:03,728 --> 02:49:07,988
the like the researchers I mean

3676
02:49:06,279 --> 02:49:10,899
harvard-trained works at harvard

3677
02:49:07,988 --> 02:49:11,879
research and cannabis for the last what

3678
02:49:10,898 --> 02:49:14,648
50 years

3679
02:49:11,879 --> 02:49:16,449
I mean just incredible incredible

3680
02:49:14,648 --> 02:49:18,430
speakers to have gathered for this

3681
02:49:16,450 --> 02:49:23,171
documentary I loved it

3682
02:49:18,431 --> 02:49:29,640
keep the question how many years do you

3683
02:49:23,171 --> 02:49:29,640
think like he worked for he's like XDI

3684
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:44,260
he was a detective for a whole bunch of

3685
02:49:41,171 --> 02:49:46,060
years in Baltimore I believe yeah those

3686
02:49:44,261 --> 02:49:48,881
dudes always have some stories man like

3687
02:49:46,060 --> 02:49:52,449
yeah every time like it's we have more

3688
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:54,220
of them they come over to our side then

3689
02:49:52,450 --> 02:50:00,311
they then you know like the druggies

3690
02:49:54,220 --> 02:50:03,341
clean up and go to the cops it's made up

3691
02:50:00,310 --> 02:50:07,181
fully of ex judges cops detectives DEA

3692
02:50:03,341 --> 02:50:10,421
agents that just doesn't do anything but

3693
02:50:07,181 --> 02:50:11,980
harm and it might come from an

3694
02:50:10,421 --> 02:50:14,291
interesting place of trying to prevent

3695
02:50:11,979 --> 02:50:16,960
drug use but it doesn't do that at all

3696
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:19,000
and on top of not being effective at all

3697
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:21,040
at its main goal it's also incredibly

3698
02:50:19,001 --> 02:50:24,371
harmful of the society it's great timing

3699
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:27,581
that's right I'm I can agree with that

3700
02:50:24,370 --> 02:50:30,029
it also had clips from Joe Rogan we saw

3701
02:50:27,581 --> 02:50:32,140
a snoop dizzle who saw Lester Grinspoon

3702
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:33,461
Brian Redman was there a lot of people

3703
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:34,870
might not know who that is but I know

3704
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:47,140
who he isn't shout out to Brian Redman

3705
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:49,090
be roles in there they also look up to a

3706
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:50,440
lot of those people actually sure that

3707
02:50:49,091 --> 02:50:52,591
cannabis scientifically they prove that

3708
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:54,911
cannabis does not cause schizophrenia

3709
02:50:52,591 --> 02:50:56,700
they remind you talk a lot about that

3710
02:50:54,911 --> 02:51:00,040
research in the beginning I love you Dan

3711
02:50:56,700 --> 02:51:02,730
cannabis was outlawed in 1937 and they

3712
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:07,239
actually mentioned that alcohol

3713
02:51:02,729 --> 02:51:09,370
poisoning causes 250,000 deaths per year

3714
02:51:07,239 --> 02:51:11,261
did you catch the tobacco numbers

3715
02:51:09,370 --> 02:51:14,560
no I've hundred thousand they compared

3716
02:51:11,261 --> 02:51:17,530
it to the Holocaust I mean okay you're

3717
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:19,120
right a Holocaust around the planet

3718
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:21,881
every year due to tobacco consumption

3719
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:24,489
not just the gern or the Jewish people

3720
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:26,411
but also the German soldiers that died I

3721
02:51:24,489 --> 02:51:27,640
don't remember how they broken down it's

3722
02:51:26,411 --> 02:51:28,960
like five and a half million people

3723
02:51:27,640 --> 02:51:30,738
around the globe die every year due to

3724
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:34,579
tobacco consumption in

3725
02:51:30,738 --> 02:51:37,100
it's just crazy zero from cannabis the

3726
02:51:34,579 --> 02:51:39,289
US has a model around the country around

3727
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:42,229
the world is about place that has pushed

3728
02:51:39,290 --> 02:51:45,290
tobacco consumption down to record

3729
02:51:42,228 --> 02:51:47,179
levels with education that's really all

3730
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:49,880
we did is we check ID at the point of

3731
02:51:47,180 --> 02:51:53,000
sale and we tell every school kid

3732
02:51:49,879 --> 02:51:54,619
if you smoke tobacco it will lead to

3733
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,870
these health effects and we give them

3734
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:58,689
the legit and legitimate information on

3735
02:51:56,870 --> 02:52:02,720
tobacco and that's all we did

3736
02:51:58,689 --> 02:52:08,898
and they made cue catchy kind of

3737
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:11,539
teenager commercials smoking ads and

3738
02:52:08,898 --> 02:52:12,799
stuff like the really effective stuff is

3739
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:14,449
just sitting the kid down in health

3740

work

3787
02:54:02,629 --> 02:54:05,180

02:54:30,050 --> 02:54:39,379
rip I really hope they had some at the

3799
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:42,699
beginning was they gave them snacks and

3800
02:54:39,379 --> 02:54:42,699
they gave them drinks and they gave

3801
02:54:45,101 --> 02:54:49,250
myself taken off a [ __ ] iTunes but

3802
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:51,110

3806
02:55:05,060 --> 02:55:08,569
minutes later so I'm just gonna let it

3807
02:55:06,379 --> 02:55:11,119

3809
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:19,880
ahead and tell you basically from memory

3810
02:55:12,379 --> 02:55:21,079
they're starting to feel it now playing

3811
02:55:19,879 --> 02:55:23,180
with it with their second hand and the

3812
02:55:21,079 --> 02:55:25,640
other tricks like no you can't you're

3813
02:55:23,181 --> 02:55:27,591
not supposed to she couldn't even do

02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:29,181
with two seconds so 15 minutes later

3815
02:55:27,591 --> 02:55:31,810
we'll turn it up for a second oh they

3816
02:55:29,181 --> 02:55:31,810
pull out a vaporizer

3817
02:55:33,510 --> 02:55:52,750
leave it up it kind of looks like a sex

3818
02:55:35,739 --> 02:55:54,670
toy and now she's token it she's

3819

actually hitting it so I'm gonna jump in

3820
02:55:54,670 --> 02:56:06,520

tell they're visibly high but nothing

3827
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:11,110
goes wrong these are all ladies that

3828
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:13,299
one's got like a damn sweater

3829
02:57:11,110 --> 02:57:15,970
it's a shawl baby but it looks like a

3830
02:57:13,299 --> 02:57:21,279
[ __ ] blanket wrapped around her scarf

3831
02:57:15,969 --> 02:57:24,359
these look like lunch ladies like this

3832
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:35,890
they take all the scary consumption

3833
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:36,939
there at the end we're not gonna do the

3834
02:57:35,889 --> 02:57:38,349
whole thing on the show because we're

3835
02:57:36,939 --> 02:57:41,229
running out of time I don't think you

3836
02:57:38,350 --> 02:57:43,040
guys would approve it's funny um what

3837
02:57:41,228 --> 02:57:45,649
else did I want to do on the show

3838
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:47,090
your grandma send it to your grandma I

3839
02:57:45,649 --> 02:57:51,399
don't know about all that

3840
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:53,750
yeah that'd be weird whatever shows

3841
02:57:51,399 --> 02:57:54,289

3842
02:57:53,750 --> 02:57:56,479

3843
02:57:54,290 --> 02:57:57,530

3844
02:57:56,479 --> 02:58:00,739
wrapping up to show you guys we've gone

3845
02:57:57,530 --> 02:58:01,730

3846
02:58:00,739 --> 02:58:03,590
movie a culture hi

3847
02:58:01,729 --> 02:58:05,359
I think the Joe Rogan show kicked ass I

3848
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:06,920
think this grandma smokin weed video was

3849
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:08,690
pretty awesome if you don't have some

3850

stuff to watch on TV if you're bored

3851
02:58:08,690 --> 02:58:11,360
pull up your phone pull up your computer

3852
02:58:10,250 --> 02:58:15,139
