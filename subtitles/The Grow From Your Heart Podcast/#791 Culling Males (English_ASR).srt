113
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,620
says I picked up the blueberry butcher

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
regular seeds I've planted all 10 of

115
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,319
them sounds like you're about to have a

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,299
party bro and thanks for grabbing the

117
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,699
blueberry butchers since they are in the

118
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,798
vegetative stage some are bushy and some

119
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,238
are taller yes that is a uh a

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,918
phenotypical expression you'll see that

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,739
I'm amongst the population that is very

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,839
common especially amongst the F1 filial

123
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,259
generation it says they are 10 to 24

124
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,359
average 24 inches tall on average I'm

125
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,160
going to take clones from each one and

126
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,020
then flip them to flower that is a great

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,360
strategy I recommend that take a clone

128
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,859
from everything before you flour it

129
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,780
because you may have the most amazing

130
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,100
cannabis you've ever grown there it may

131
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,198
be your favorite it might be the plant

132
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,400
that does the thing you need done and if

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
you don't have a clone of it it'd be

134
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,279
really heartbreaking to know that that

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,740
jar will be empty someday and you can't

136
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,719
reproduce it so always take a clone that

137
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,300
is my strategy that is my preaching then

138
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,400
it goes on it says how would I do this

139
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,079
that's a very good question it said how

140
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,060
would I control the males from not

141
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,459
throwing pollen how long would it take

142
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,600
for a novice Grover to realize the males

143
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,219
and then there's a little bit more

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,139
details we'll talk about later on in

145
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,080
this so this is a great question we can

146
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,540
talk very in depth about this one this

147
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,819
is basically about doing cutting clones

148
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,500
to do some sexing and not contaminating

149
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,899
the rest of the girl with pollen so

150
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
let's talk about this all right so it

151
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,899
sounds like you've got a good idea of

152
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,759
what you were doing already and you were

153
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,159
already on to a good path of being

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,620
successful with this uh the plants are

155
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
10 to 24 inches tall on average which

156
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,579
means by the time this episode comes out

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
it will be time to get clones from these

158
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,538
plants so how do we do this uh very

159
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,620
simply grow them you've got them in your

160
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,879
pots you've got them under lights

161
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,759
they're growing they're going to keep

162
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,860
producing branches I would recommend

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,319
taking three clones from each plant

164
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,060
that's going to be 30 Cuts if legally

165
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,399
and everything is that's possible for

166
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,038
you I recommend taking three clones from

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,719
each plant uh there's going to be one

168
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,699
really healthy clone at the top of the

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,500
plant that main top I would make that

170
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,080
the Clone that's always my favorite

171
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,759
clone then I always clean up the bottom

172
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,139
branches off of my plants if you've got

173
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,000
a couple of good healthy branches there

174
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,560
on the bottom make two clones out of

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,259
those now you've got three clones from

176
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,418
every plant I use I can make clones in

177
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,220
an easy cloner I can make clones in the

178
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,198
uh little root Riot plugs with the Dome

179
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,479
over it I'm pretty proficient at making

180
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,819
clones in just about any style that

181
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,860
needs to be done however when I do clone

182
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,019
making videos YouTube doesn't like it

183
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,300
and they take them down so I can tell

184
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,680
you briefly how I do clones I wait till

185
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,500
the plants are nice and healthy and then

186
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,560
I cut them at a 45 degree angle I dip it

187
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,120
in a I use the uh the clonex gel the

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
purple stuff I use that wear gloves when

189
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,139
you use that always

190
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,819
cut it at a 45 degree angle dip it in

191
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,439
the clonex and then if you're going into

192
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,120
an easy cloner all you got to do is put

193
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,680
it in the collar and then make sure the

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,978
water in the easy cloner is appropriate

195
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,319
I use a EC of 1.1 with the easy cloner

196
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,060
uh the clonex uh the liquid solution the

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,819
yellow one and then I will adjust the pH

198
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,220
to about six one six two and then I will

199
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,660
set it and forget it sometimes if uh I

200
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,160
know it's in a warm room sometimes I'll

201
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,900
add some of the what's the product that

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,639
prevents the algae from growing in there

203
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,079
can't even think of the name clearas I

204
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,879
knew when I gave up it popped into my

205
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,800
head add some clear Reds in there once

206
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,019
every five to seven days ish and just

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,819
Let It Rock uh maybe add some water in

208
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,579
there a few days later and that cloner

209
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,560
should Rock for you or clip it dip it

210
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,240
and then stick it into the uh a rapid

211
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,978
Rooter and then I feed those rapid

212
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,379
rooters I spray them actually to keep

213
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,060
them nice and wet but not too soggy uh

214
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,899
put this the cloning solution the same

215
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,780
solution 1.1 uh clonex at a pH of about

216
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,459
6.2 shake it up real good spray the the

217
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,959
root Riot plugs or the rapid Rooter

218
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,638
plugs so there so get those nice and

219
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,918
appropriately wet I spray them with a

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,418
spray bottle I dip the Clone in the

221
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,519
clonex solution then pop it right in

222
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,258
there I spray the underside of the Dome

223
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,698
so it's wet inside there then I put that

224
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,500
dome right on top of it at this point

225
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,000
all of the vents are covered up and then

226
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,680
I put it under a light to get a lot of

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,478
humidity happening in there and I

228
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,180
probably won't touch that for five to

229
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,740
seven days then I'll slowly start

230
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,418
popping it open for a little bit of time

231
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,519
slowly open the vents and increase my

232
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:04,620
open interval until I can get them into

233
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,060
their forever homes but that is a

234
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,439
quickie on how to do clones there are

235
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,300
full episodes on that however YouTube

236
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,918
keeps taking mine down shout out to

237
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,660
YouTube for that part

238
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,978
um so get your plants grow them until

239
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,960
they're big enough to get a clone get

240
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,300
three clones from each plant

241
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,180
I like to wait since you're kind of new

242
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,800
I would wait until those clones begin to

243
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,120
show roots that way you know that you've

244
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
got them they're going to be successful

245
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,199
you've got three opportunities for each

246
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,579
one as soon as you see Roots popping out

247
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,478
of however you're doing the Clones if

248
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,399
it's out of the bottom of the easy

249
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,620
cloner or popping out of the the rapid

250
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,899
rooters then I would put the main big

251
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,580
plants into flower now we can move the

252
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,080
big plants into flour we've got clones

253
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,000
we don't have to stress about having a

254
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,099
preservation or a backup they're already

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
rooting they should work out and also if

256
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,040
they don't you've still got a few days

257
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,139
to take clones there's also the option

258
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,719
for re-veg but I digress let's keep

259
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,699
going here uh we've got our clones we're

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,800
gonna put the big plants Under 12 12.

261
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,080
they're going to start flowering now in

262
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,179
about 12 days you should be able to

263
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,860
identify the males and the females it

264
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,899
may take a little bit longer and maybe a

265
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,240
little bit earlier but generally 10 to

266
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,799
14 days is how long it takes for a

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,480
cannabis plant to show you if it's a

268
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,699
male or a female this will depend on

269
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,440
several things this will depend on how

270
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,540
far end of veg this plant has been going

271
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,240
how long has it been in that pot how

272
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,338
root bound is it how tall is the plan

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,139
also some plants like to show you that

274
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,700
they're male way earlier than some other

275
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,220
plants like to show you males so just

276
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,259
maybe a real eager candidate to show you

277
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,180
that's a male also this will depend on

278
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,200
your lighting how much lighting have you

279
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,239
been giving these plants if they're

280
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,980
getting a lot of light it may show you a

281
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,480
little bit more early if they haven't

282
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,580
been getting a lot of light it may take

283
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,200
a little bit longer also one thing to

284
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,879
keep in mind that I noticed those plants

285
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,220
that get real stretchy right away and

286
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,200
grow right above everybody a lot of the

287
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,180
times those are male plants so get don't

288
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,860
get too excited about the taller plants

289
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,079
in the garden when you're in veg because

290
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,940
oftentimes those are the boys they want

291
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,379
to get above all the girls so that when

292
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,120
they get taller when it's time to flower

293
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,220
they can put pollen out and the pollen

294
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,959
will fall down onto the girls that's why

295
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,700
the boys try to get taller get above

296
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,079
everybody that's their whole intention

297
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,420
of that let me get back to the notes

298
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,620
back to the question uh that way we can

299
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,539
help you out a little bit more

300
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,240
accurately my question is how would I

301
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,278
control males from not throwing pollen

302
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,039
so they're probably not going to dump

303
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,620
pollen somewhere until about day 14 to

304
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,059
21 maybe right in that area about day 17

305
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,740
is probably when you're going to get

306
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,838
pollen they're going to show you that

307
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,240
they're males about day 10. so you've

308
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,620
got a four day seven day period of when

309
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,700
you're not gonna have any problems you

310
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,740
can pull them out of there they don't

311
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,959
just uh the male plants don't just pop

312
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,180
up and go poof I'm ejecting pollen they

313
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,619
start building uh you've got to look at

314
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,299
books and establish first of all learn

315
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,980
how to identify males and females that

316
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,719
should have been I should have done that

317
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,879
part should have guided you to do that

318
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,220
part way earlier in this episode learn

319
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,778
how to identify males and females that

320
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,040
should be in every cannabis book that

321
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,320
should be all over the Internet I've

322
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,480
done an episode on it learn how to

323
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,860
identify males and females they will

324
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
start popping up the males will start

325
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,700
popping up little Nubs and that little

326
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,260
nub will start to get a little a little

327
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,480
branch on it then on that Branch we'll

328
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,039
form a little ball then more balls will

329
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,360
form and then more balls will form and

330
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,519
eventually those balls will start to

331
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,079
open up and pollen will come out you get

332
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,240
plenty of warning that that is a male

333
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,879
plant before the pollen forms so pay

334
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,039
attention that is the way to prevent the

335
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,379
uh pollen from coming out

336
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,719
identify the males you can do that like

337
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,919
I said probably 10 to 14 days and you've

338
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,540
still got if you do it quickly enough

339
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,399
you will not get any pollen in the room

340
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,679
you got to go in there and do a visual

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
inspection of every single plant push

342
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,919
all the plants into a group on one side

343
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
of the room and then move them back over

344
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,639
into their spot to the left side of the

345
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,560
room as you look at them not a not a

346
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,899
male move it over not a male move it

347
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,699
over not a male move it over so put them

348
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,700
into flour and pay attention to them

349
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,640
your other option another option is you

350
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,399
can get a lab sex test you can order a

351
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,139
lab sex testing kit from farmer Freeman

352
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,360
or other companies big shout out to our

353
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,919
buddy farmer Freeman does not pay me to

354
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,139
support him but he's just a good got a

355
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:02,399
good product does good work so they will

356
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:03,778
send you a sex testing sample kit you'll

357
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,278
take a little sample of your leaf and

358
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:07,139
rub it on a little card I'm not sure how

359
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,778
farmer Freeman does it but you just take

360
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,639
a leaf rub it on a card fold that up you

361
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,078
mark that plan number seven or whatever

362
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,179
it says and then you mark that card

363
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,458
number seven or whatever it says you

364
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,259
send all your cards to the testing lab

365
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,239
they send you an email that says plant

366
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,519
one is a boy plant two is a girl plant

367
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,019
three is a boy plant four is a girl they

368
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,879
let you have a breakdown of every plant

369
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,919
that is male and female so then you can

370
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,139
use that lab testing or you can use your

371
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,179
visual eyes to go ahead and identify

372
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,159
male plants and when you do identify the

373
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,179
males if it's through a lab report or if

374
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,399
it's through your own visual

375
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,019
identification go ahead and cut down

376
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
that male plant but wait till you're

377
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,440
sure because a lot of people are new and

378
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
they see some stuff happening and they

379
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,500
think that the plant is a male and they

380
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,940
cut it down a little bit early make sure

381
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,379
you're certain that that plant is a male

382
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,839
and then cut it down as soon as you're

383
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,000
positive it is a male then the next step

384
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,980
is to go in the Clone room and remove

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,778
all of the Clones that came from that

386
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,000
plant so when you cut the Clones make

387
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,860
sure they are clearly labeled so go in

388
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
the room clearly label the Clones when

389
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,940
you cut them they came from plant a

390
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,379
plant B Plant C you can name them if you

391
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,420
want you can give them letters numbers

392
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,399
you could put colored stickers on them

393
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,620
as long as it matches red plant red

394
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,139
clones purple plant purple clones plant

395
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,299
number 57 clone number 57 as long as

396
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,220
that [ __ ] matches up and your code you

397
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,659
could draw hieroglyphics if you want as

398
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,459
long as it matches and you know that

399
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:25,199
I've got to get rid of the uh the

400
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,299
hieroglyphic that looks like an antelope

401
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
on the big plant and the hieroglyphic

402
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,439
that looks like an antelope on the

403
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,000
little plant so uh go in there once

404
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
you've identified the males and females

405
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,799
remove both the big plant and the little

406
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,659
plant then the other part of the

407
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,000
question is how long would it take for a

408
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,559
novice grower to realize the males if

409
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,059
you do a little bit of research on the

410
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,559
internet and look at a couple of books

411
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,778
and see what a male and a female plant

412
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,179
looks like it'll be very obvious in

413
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,919
about 12 days from flower I I really

414
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,379
think you'll be able to identify them if

415
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,599
you can't come to the Discord come to

416
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,399
the irie Army Discord and go to the

417
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,500
general help tab or anywhere in there

418
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,120
and just post pictures and say hey can

419
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,059
somebody help me identify if these are

420
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,500
males or females a lot of people will go

421
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,299
in there and they'll give you very

422
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,458
useful advice I trust the people in the

423
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,139
irie Army and if you really really need

424
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,819
help tag me and I'll go look at it and

425
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,680
I'll see if I can give you solid advice

426
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,660
but I do trust the whole crew in there

427
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,859
they will give you good advice

428
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,139
um how long would it take probably about

429
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,879
10 days side note I will be going on

430
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,700
vacation oh this is going to be the fun

431
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,620
part going on vacation March 22nd if I

432
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,420
flip to flower would I have enough time

433
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,459
to see the males and remove them from

434
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,860
the garden which should be about three

435
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,239
weeks or so from me writing this uh

436
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,000
you're gonna find out if you got males

437
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,680
or females in about 14 days I would flip

438
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,839
now and this episode comes out it's time

439
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,299
to flip do it that day it's going to be

440
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,980
the first week of March still when this

441
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,379
comes out so go ahead and flip now do

442
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,879
that now that's my advice to you all

443
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,919
right there is more to this he does talk

444
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,480
about the setup uh we don't need to know

445
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,698
about the setup right now we are still

446
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,740
sexting the plants so really quickly I

447
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:00,659
do have some notes here it says veg damn

448
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,879
uh clone them make sure you get good

449
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,259
labels flip the big plants also you guys

450
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,179
you don't have to flip the big plants a

451
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,919
lot of people will flip the small plants

452
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,719
uh and then you can find out if those

453
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,799
are males or females right away or

454
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,079
another way to do it I should have

455
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,059
mentioned this also you can just veg

456
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,439
them and then re or flip them into flour

457
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,299
and re-vege I've talked about that

458
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,560
however this listener does not have time

459
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,179
for that because he's got to go on

460
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,278
vacation

461
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,319
um keep the Clones you need keep the big

462
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,240
plants you need and then watch out for

463
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,980
the males and call the plants that you

464
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,539
don't eat I think I covered it I

465
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,278
recapped I think I answered your

466
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,719
question pretty well my friend high off

467
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,179
kebabs thank you for the great question

468
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,339
I hope we are able to identify your male

469
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,138
and female plants before you do go on

470
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,779
vacation like we said if you need any

471
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,698
help do send pictures to the irie Army

472
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,559
Discord we will do our best to help you

473
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,240
out but it should be quite obvious which

474
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,000
are boys and girls and also don't forget

475
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,278
send me another email with your shipping

476
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,740
address and a good name to put on the

477
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,860
box because you my friend did win a free

478
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,060
pack of irie Genetics seeds all right

479
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,199
I've got another message here in front

480

481
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,198
time I do get quite rambly this one came

482
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,480
from the irie genetics help tab on

483
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:11,578
iregenetics.com uh The Listener wants to

484
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,019
be called ripened bananas they've got a

485
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:15,958
problem in the garden they're growing

486
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,519
wedding cheesecake Auto cross to Jawa

487
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,338
pie that sounds delicious they're going

488
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,600
indoors under LEDs let's get to the main

489
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,279
part of the question here I'm not sure

490
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,800
some of this info pertains to the

491
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,838
question it says yo roster Jeff I'm

492
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,259
wondering about keeping regular mails

493
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,600
and auto to regular F1 males and the veg

494
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,578
light cycle to save on hold to

495
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,259
eventually breed with but not for a

496
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,659
while all right it's a long since I have

497
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,680
another breeding project going first all

498
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,679
right so there's a lot of stuff to

499
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,239
unpack there regular males are going to

500
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,879
be one set of answers in this question

501
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,759
Auto to regulars are going to be another

502
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:54,120
answer and F1 males just count on the

503
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:57,180
same batch as regular males also I think

504
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,560
Autos could be f1s as well but

505
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,120
um just wanted to clear some of that up

506
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,319
and then we're going to move forward it

507
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,759
says

508
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,220
um I have another breeding project going

509
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,798
will the male plants in veg typically

510
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,720
not pollinate any females around or will

511
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,240
they sometimes pollinate female plants

512
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,818
if they are held held for a long time in

513
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,818
a vegetative stage I feel like stable

514
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:19,500
genetics uh that's not the correct term

515
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,539
use of the word stable here we've talked

516
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,240
about that would mostly not pollinate

517
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,438
Less in flower light cycle but I also

518
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,900
wouldn't be surprised if it happens

519
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,940
sometimes trying to hone my skills with

520
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,500
stability and best practices thank you

521

great message there's a lot to talk

526
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400

527
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,779
um oh by the way also you did win a free

528

pack of seeds I'm reading your message

529
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,339
here on the show which means that you

530
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,500
should send me your address as well so

531
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,240
that I can send you a free pack of irie

532
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,160
genetic seeds that that giveaway once

533
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,079
again is sponsored by seedsherandow.com

534
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,880
gotta remember to mention our friends at

535
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,599
seeds here now let's talk about a lot of

536
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
this

537
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,558
uh will the male plants uh typically not

538
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,779
pollinate

539
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,279
um in a vegetative stage if it's in a

540
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,480
true vegetative stage it will not

541
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,099
pollinate those plants will not

542
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,919
pollinate like I talked about previously

543
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,599
they'll need some time to shift into the

544
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,520
flower stage then they'll need time to

545
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,839
start developing pollen sacks then it'll

546
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,759
take a little bit for those sacks to

547
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,779
open you should be paying attention to

548
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,819
the plants you should be able to

549
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,200
identify that way before that happens

550
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,259
however

551
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,058
these are cannabis plants and [ __ ] does

552
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,919
go Haywire sometimes if you get a male

553
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:31,678
plant that is not getting enough light

554
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,960
it becomes root bound or is just not

555
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,580
getting fed enough sometimes they'll go

556
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,980
into panic mode and they will start to

557
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,199
flower just like a female plant uh some

558
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,720
of us have female plants that are of a a

559
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,700
more tropical variety a longer flowering

560
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,140
varietal sometimes if you don't give

561
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,819
them enough light if they get a little

562
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,740
bit root bound if they get shaded a

563
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,720
little bit or if you just over or under

564
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,279
feed it or if it gets bugs it may just

565
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,380
go into flower because it's in [ __ ]

566
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,538
panic mode and that's just what some

567
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,700
plants do so if your male plant does

568
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,038
experience any stress any drought over

569
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,779
feeding under feeding if it's too

570
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,519
crowded in it may start to stretch up

571
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,139
and then it'll go hey guess what you're

572
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,119
not treating me right I'm going into

573
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,759
flour and then it'll just flower at that

574
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,500
point yes it can pollinate plants but

575
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,819
keep in mind also the female plants can

576
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,880
only receive pollen once they've

577
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,319
developed pistols and the male plants uh

578
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,000
will only pollinate once they've

579
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,918
developed these stamens and those have

580
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,480
grown out and then exploded a little bit

581
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,100
so let me catch up read the notes Here

582
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,839
make sure I'm on the right track to

583
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,058
answering you a little bit

584
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,319
um they won't pollinate unless they make

585
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,779
some pollen you gotta put them into

586
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,579
flour or they've got to uh flour because

587
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,700
you've stress induced that flowering

588
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:41,279
stage then stability we've talked about

589
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,798
stability that is more stability means

590
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,480
uniformity amongst population more than

591
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,139
anything so

592
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,599
um any plants could express a phenotype

593
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,038
that will make pollen under uh not

594
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,480
perfect conditions if you're stressing

595
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,759
the plant that could happen with any

596
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,980
plant so uh keep the room right keep the

597
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,538
male plant happy don't a lot of people

598
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,679
just shove the mail off into the corner

599
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:03,900
and they're like I'll use them when I

600
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,340
need him uh treat him like he's the star

601
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,780
of the show the male plant is the

602
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,480
[ __ ] King my plant is called King

603
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,099
Solomon uh without without that male the

604
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,779
other girls aren't going to make seeds

605
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,159
so he stays right in the middle under

606
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,019
the light I've got to Jack the Ripper

607
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,240
mail we've got a King Solomon male I got

608
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,980
the BC Lemon Skunk mail there's a

609
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,538
chocolate male all just right under

610
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,579
their own light the boys get their own

611
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:25,200
little section because they're just as

612
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,119
important to me so don't overlook the

613
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,580
importance of taking care of your male

614
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,558
plant of uh pruning it lollipopping it

615
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,178
topping it taking a couple of backup

616
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,918
clones every now and then just in case

617
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,780
when I'm in the room cutting clones even

618
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,038
if I don't need a clone of the boys I'm

619
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,599
going to take a clone off the bottom

620
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,700
Branch as I clean up just because if

621
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,740
some [ __ ] goes wrong I want to have one

622
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,660
in the cloner one in a small pot and

623
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,339
then one under the lights because those

624
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,679
are the those are the pollinators bro

625
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,599
I've it took longer I spent more time

626
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,220
selecting the male plants than I did any

627
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,019
of the female plants because I need

628
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,298
solid male plants in my lineup I've

629
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,798
talked a lot about that but

630
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,599
um give them their space give them the

631
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,339
room the area the care that the male

632
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,879
plants that they deserve just like the

633
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:08,519
females they are all equal in that room

634
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,500
um trying to hone my skills and with uh

635
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,819
stability and best practices thank you

636
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,079
so much for your awesome content bro

637
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,819
thank you for the great question I hope

638
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,980
I answered your your question if you

639
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,960
give them proper care proper light they

640
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,940
will not throw any pollen until they go

641
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,880
into pollen or there of course is the

642
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,798
option to stress induce some pollen from

643
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,240
those male plants all right dude thank

644
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,700
you for the great question again do send

645
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,740
me your email address because I do owe

646
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,200
you a free pack of seeds because I read

647
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,120
