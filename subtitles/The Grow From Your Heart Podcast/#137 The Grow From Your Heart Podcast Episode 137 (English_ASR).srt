00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:36,668
go back and listen to 136 it is a great

134
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:38,769
podcast alright I think that's all the

135
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:41,319
ads and information I have got to start

136
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:44,409
the show I want to talk about a message

137
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,538
I received from a listener he was

138
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,970
talking about wondering if CBD derived

139
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:51,610
from hemp is any good if it is the same

140
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,320
as CBD derived from cannabis he was

141
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,410
thinking that hemp derived CBD would not

142
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,168
have any medicinal value I'm here to

143
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,180
clear that up that is inaccurate CBD

144
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:03,759
derived from hemp and CBD derived from

145
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,220
cannabis is the same CBD you're pulling

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,079
out the same CBD the main difference

147
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,490
between hemp and cannabis is the amount

148
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,359
of THC the state of Colorado has set a

149
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,740
threshold of how much THC is

150
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,650
allowed to be in your plants before they

151
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,509
are considered hemp or THC honestly I do

152
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,418
not remember the exact ratio it is I

153
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,699
think it's 5% THC it could be 0.5

154
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:27,438
percent THC it could be 3 it's somewhere

155
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,579
between 3 and 5 percent THC to the best

156
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,740
of my knowledge if it's got more than

157
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,329
that it is considered cannabis if it's

158
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,210
got less than that it is considered a

159
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:38,209
hemp plant our friends over at sand saw

160
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:40,489
a giant CBD farmer a giant hemp farm

161
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,188
here in Pueblo Colorado produce massive

162
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,810
amounts of CBD product from their hemp

163
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,879
farm so if you were confused if you were

164
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,889
thinking that CBD derived from hemp

165
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,750
verses CBD derived from cannabis is a

166
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,668
different product ladies and gentlemen

167
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,339
that is the same molecule it will have

168
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:57,500
the same medicinal benefits it will do

169
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,878
the same thing for you if you took what

170
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,949
was considered a hemp plant that was

171
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,199
high in CBD and a cannabis plant that

172
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,090
was high in THC and he ran them both to

173
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,560
the exact same extraction method whether

174
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:11,179
it be pho or co2 you would pull out very

175
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,459
similar products very similar

176
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,189
concentrates but the hemp product is

177
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:19,579
going to be very high in CBD and it will

178
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:21,379
not contain any THC or very very trace

179
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,468
amounts if any at all so the only

180
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,879
difference is the source and the main

181
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:28,250
difference of the source is just the

182
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,599
lack of THC so I pressed pause and I did

183
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,848
a little bit of research in the state of

184
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,610
Colorado the difference between hemp and

185
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:38,269
cannabis if a plant contains greater

186
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,370
than 0.3 percent THC it is considered a

187
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,310
cannabis plant and it cannot qualify to

188
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,740
be in a hemp farm so that is a threshold

189
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,930
there is 0.3 percent THC if it's got

190
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,939
more than 0.3 it cannot be grown in a

191
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,889
hemp farm it must be then grown in a

192
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,050
medical marijuana or a recreational

193
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,228
marijuana cultivation facility that is

194
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,180
regulated by the meed which is a totally

195
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:01,188
different ballgame than growing hemp so

196
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,110
we're able to produce large amounts of

197
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,210
CBD products now because we're using

198
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,430
hemp farms to do so which is making CBD

199
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,788
medicine available to many more people

200
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,598
so I hope that clears that up for you

201
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,860
we're gonna move forward and thank you

202
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,569
for the email I've got another email

203
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,729
this one came from another listener I'm

204
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,550
not going to say if you send me an email

205
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,750
and you want your name set on the air

206
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,129
include that in your email because I try

207
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,509
to be respectful and not bust out

208
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,569
people's names I don't know what state

209
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,889
you're in I don't know where you

210
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,939
I don't know what you do I don't want to

211
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,278
get you in trouble by saying your name

212
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,800
on the show so if you'd like me to say

213
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:32,249

214
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,110
email

215

the compliment it's stuff like that it

219
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,629
gives me the motivation to keep this

220
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,889
show coming at you every week it takes a

221
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,419
lot of effort to do a weekly podcast

222
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,069
when you work as much as I do

223
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:51,688
so these compliments and the words of

224
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,129
affirmation is that that's called the

225
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,319
compliments and word of add words of

226
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,240
affirmation are definitely keeping me

227
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,528
moving strong so I appreciate that then

228
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,088
the email goes on to say I'm looking

229
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,348
forward to your upcoming outdoor show

230
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:03,749
you mentioned is in the works I'm

231
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:07,168
wondering if you can discuss strains

232
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,610
that do particularly well outdoors I am

233
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:10,378
trying to get more outdoor episodes for

234
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,028
tea it's hard to get Jessie here Jessie

235
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,680
is busy with his own podcast his own

236
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:15,329
Gardens his own business but when

237
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,879
Jessie's free I will get him here for

238
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,918
more outdoor stuff this guy says I'm

239
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,899
growing an organ outdoors again this

240
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,698
year when researching strains online I

241
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,559
couldn't find much information on which

242
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,538
do better indoors and out I ended up

243
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:30,539
picking clones of Blue Dream Green crack

244
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:32,158
sunset sherbet and Gorilla Glue 4 I've

245
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,750
read that Blue Dream does phenomenally

246
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,938
outdoors but couldn't find much on the

247
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,668
rest I looked at past Emerald cup

248
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:40,348
winners to see what has won there since

249
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:42,688
those grows are outdoors but I couldn't

250
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,550
find many of those strains locally I'm

251
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,679
interested in PM resistant strains as

252
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:49,049
well since that's something we battle

253
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,309
come fall there's more to the email but

254
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,838
I took a screen shot and I didn't get

255
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,188
the rest of it in there so I appreciate

256
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,410
you sending me that email let's talk

257
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:58,799
about a few strains that I think would

258
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,600
do very well for you outdoors first of

259
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,028
all I could recommend almost anything

260
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,209
from DJ short DJ shorts Flo and

261
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:08,039
blueberry do wonderfully outdoors those

262
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,109
strains are very mold resistant they

263
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,179
finish kind of early and they will give

264
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,949
you nice heavy harvests outdoors

265
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,289
something you want to keep in mind for

266
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:17,969
an outdoor garden as you need stuff that

267
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,289
is going to finish kind of early you

268
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,420
don't want it to take a super long time

269
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:23,578
you got to get it done before the fall

270
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,958
or the winter comes may be out there in

271
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:27,328
Oregon you have more time than we do

272
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,399
here in Colorado so you have a maybe a

273
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:30,508
little longer window maybe you might be

274
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,490
able to get something like some Sour

275
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,829
Diesel or some chem dog those strains do

276
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,750
very well outdoors I they're very mold

277
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,949
resistant you're gonna want to stick

278
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,840
with strains that finish

279
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,110
around sixty days about eight weeks

280
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,420
trains would be ideal for you um

281
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,159
something like from my lineup I would

282
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,799
recommend Capleton for outdoor strains

283
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,779
it finishes on time and puts on nice

284
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,240
resin it loves the sunshine when you

285
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,919
grow it in soil add plenty of kelp

286
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,620
products it'll make it taste nice nice

287
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,919
and funky nice and earthy Capleton is

288
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,870
very mold resistant also golden go if

289
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,809
you can get it finished in time golden

290
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,299
go will take about 65 to 70 days to

291
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:12,089
reach full maturity outdoors but outdoor

292
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:15,000
golden goat is amazing golden goat loves

293
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,190
that sunshine and it will harvest super

294
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,049
heavily another strain i can recommend

295
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,570
for great outdoor growing is old school

296
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:23,879
hindu kush hindu kush finishes on time

297
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,800
and it really loves to be grown in an

298
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,330
outdoor environment we had some

299
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,969
wonderful hindu kush going through our

300
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,620
area a few years ago i knew the grower

301
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,690
he said he never had problems with

302
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,610
mildew the bugs didn't like the hindu

303
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,530
kush it was a wonderful plant for

304
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,810
outdoor so those are some great outdoor

305
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,159
strains that we can recommend it looks

306
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,989
like you've already chosen your strains

307
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,029
because you had to rely on clothes that

308
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,560
were available in your area so the blue

309
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,299
dream should do all right outside it

310
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,519
should produce really heavily if it gets

311
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,919
finished on time Green crack I don't

312
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,569
have a lot of experience with the sunset

313
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,149
sherbet I don't have a lot of experience

314
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,220
there Gorilla Glue for that is a hardy

315
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,740
plant it will grow like a beast outside

316
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,870
I hope everything finishes up on time I

317
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,360
hope your outdoor harvest goes perfectly

318
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,230
for you I thank you for the email and I

319
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,990

sorry words are hard today you guys he

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,860
says I've started my outdoor crop early

00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:31,769
indoors under a 400 watt metal halide

329
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,690
and July 1st is my outside plant day and

330
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:38,490
currently my plants are on a 24 hour

331
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,080
cycle I feel I should 18:6 to start

332
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,669
acclimating them to get ready for the

333
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,680
outdoors soon any thoughts on this

334
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:45,750
subject I appreciate your time I know

335
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,309
you're a busy man sincerely a longtime

336
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,029
podcast listener and then he signs with

337
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,879
his name

338
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,990
so dude I don't know if you want me to

339
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,149
see your name

340
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,590
but uh he's asking if he he's growing

341
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,730
his plants indoors and he's getting them

342
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,310
started so that he can put them outside

343
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,139
July first and he's asking so far he's

344
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,729
got them under a 24-hour light cycle and

345
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,549
he's asking if he should adjust his

346
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,639
light schedule to 18 6 to get them ready

347
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:11,379
for the outdoor Sun schedule that is a

348
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,419
really good question I feel like I'm

349
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,620
talking really fast so I'm gonna press

350
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:16,419
pause for a minute I'm gonna take a

351
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,039
couple of fat dabs and a drink and I

352
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:22,149
will be right back and we will talk

353
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,769
about this alright I am back I feel like

354
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,480
I had enough dabs to kind of override

355
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,029
all of the caffeine I've had today I

356
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,409
just took some fat dabs of lemon g grown

357

we'd love to help you out you guys let's

392
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,000
get back to this listen or email our

393
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:44,529
listener was asking about putting his

394
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,690
plants outdoors he's heading them on a

395
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,600
24-hour light cycle he wants to know if

396
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,660
he should adjust his lights to an 18-6

397
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,149
photo period before taking them outside

398
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:56,319
you know I sent Jesse a message and I

399
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,600
asked him what he thought about this

400
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,640
because I had my own idea Jesse and I

401
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,200
have two different ideas on this I think

402
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,939
both of these ideas are going to work

403
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,620
let me say this before I get too far

404
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,019
into this no matter what you do I

405
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,450
recommend that you take these plants

406
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,278
outside and put them in the Sun for

407
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,230
maybe two hours on the first day and

408
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,490
then bring them back inside and then

409
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,899
take them outside and put them in the

410
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,820
Sun for maybe two and a half to three

411
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,649
hours the next day and then bring them

412
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,420
back inside and then take them back

413
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,549
outside and just give them like you know

414
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:27,229
maybe thirty to another hour every day

415
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,838
of sunlight so they can get used to that

416
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,009
Sun and maybe by about the seventh to

417
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,029
tenth day you can just leave them out

418
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,730
there and they'll be cool but I think

419
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:36,379
you should slowly adjust them to the Sun

420
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,879
or they're good they might get fried if

421
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,799
they're if they're not super Hardy

422
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,600
plants that Sun might kick their ass so

423
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,399
keep that in mind slowly introduced them

424
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,360
to the Sun because if you just put them

425
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,409
out there they're gonna get a sunburn

426
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,050
and kind of freak out

427
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,309
so think about that my opinion about

428
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,588
your light cycle was that you should

429
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,958
just leave your lights on 24 hours and

430
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,700
then start taking the plants out and get

431
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,069
them adjusted and then once you take

432
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,269
them outside once you're permanently out

433
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,470
there if you have them in pots and

434
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,669
you're gonna leave them out there or if

435
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,070
you put them in the ground once they're

436
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,708
out there forever I will only take a few

437
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,720
days for them to adjust to the sun's

438
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,609
natural photo period the Sun is much

439
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,670
more intense than the light that you

440
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,039
have in your grow room it will it will

441
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:18,649
train those plants what to do there are

442
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,078
specific spectrums that the Sun puts off

443
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,120
at sunrise and sunset the trigger

444
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,528
hormones inside your plant that tell it

445
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,740
when to go to sleep and when to wake up

446
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:29,838
so the Sun will start programming your

447
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,970
plant when to wake up and when to sleep

448
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,260
very quickly it won't take very long for

449
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,589
your plant to adjust to that

450
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,958
if you leave your grow lights on 24/7

451
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,570
then you take it outside and you throw

452
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,789
it in that Sun on that normal cycle it

453
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,070
may start to flower that's the only

454
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:48,230
downfall to that it may start to auto

455
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,060
flower a little bit early and then it'll

456
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,699
go back into veg and then it will flower

457
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:54,500
at the appropriate time so that may be

458
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:57,528
an issue if you have a plant that has a

459
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,750
very very sensitive photo period that

460
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:02,059
would be the only downfall to that so

461
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,509
what Jesse said to do was to try to

462
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:07,549
match the schedule of the Sun with the

463
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:09,019
schedule of your grow lights that's

464
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,899
going to be a little bit challenging

465
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:14,209
because like I said the time that the

466
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,490
news or your Farmers Almanac are going

467
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:19,369
to say that the Sun is going to rise and

468
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,039
that is those those times in those books

469
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,549
and on the news are accurate but when do

470
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:27,708
the far red and near red spectrums of

471
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:29,649
the Sun starts shining onto your plants

472
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:32,059
outside it's hard to figure that out

473
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,278
exactly so you're gonna want to try to

474
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:37,549
match the Sun Rise and sunset is the

475
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,899
best you can to get those plants on sort

476
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:41,059
of a schedule but I think that you'd be

477
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,179
just fine if you ran that 24 hour light

478
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,949
cycle and slowly introduce your plants

479
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,859
to the Sun it's called hardening them

480
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,450
off I get them nice and stable put them

481
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,370
in their forever homes and then just let

482
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,640
the Sun work its magic and put those

483
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,860
plants into its schedule that would be

484
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,039
my guidance if you have the time in the

485
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,778
energy do some research find out what

486
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,938
time the Sun will be setting and rising

487
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:07,099
for about a week and then start

488
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,220
adjusting your timers every day to that

489
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,678
schedule and get your sunrise and sunset

490
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,568
times matched up exactly to the outside

491
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,699
time with the Sun and then start putting

492
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:18,438
your plants outside harden them off and

493
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,420
get them on that schedule by the time

494
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,579
they are outside permanently have them

495
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,410
adjusted to that schedule if you have

496
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:27,230
the time and the energy to research it

497
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,700
and make that happen do it if you don't

498
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,980
have the energy and the time for that

499
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,870
run it 24/7 and throw them out there if

500
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,700
you're running some indicas you'll be

501
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:37,549
just fine

502
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,140
if you're running some sativas they may

503
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:42,079
start to flower on you a little bit

504
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,759
early some of those sativas will flower

505
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,500
it a little bit sooner because just a

506
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,599
slight change in photo period is all

507
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,759
they get and their natural habitat so

508
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,889
they're gonna trigger flowering with

509
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,750
just a little bit of a variation in

510
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,270
photo period so pay attention to your

511
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,769
plants if you do notice that your plants

512
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:00,379
are starting to flower a little bit too

513
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,910
early in the season one good way to stop

514
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,130
that from happening or to make sure that

515
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,380
it doesn't happen is to get a light and

516
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,750
get a long extension cord and just carry

517
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,940
a light outside and shine it over all of

518
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,859
those plants about three hours after the

519
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,110
Sun Goes Down and that will keep those

520
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:18,109
plants awake and it won't let them turn

521
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:19,339
into their flowering cycle so that's one

522
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,139
way you can make sure that they don't

523
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,609
flower too early and if you do see them

524
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,890
starting to flower a little bit early

525
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:26,719
that's one way to kind of revert and

526
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,460
prevent this from happening it doesn't

527
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,049
matter what kind of light you use and it

528
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,519
doesn't have to be really super intense

529
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,379
as long as you just get out there for a

530
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,539
few minutes and shine it over each plant

531
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,010
you'll wake them up they won't start

532
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,869
sleeping they won't get enough sleep to

533
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:42,019
go into their flowering period and you

534
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:43,699
can kind of extend your veg phase so I

535
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,019
hope that helped you make a decision on

536
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,670
how you're going to handle your

537
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,139
adjustment just make sure you introduce

538
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,640
the plants to the sunshine kind of

539
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,930
slowly because if they're small plants

540
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,780
if they're not really healthy that Sun

541
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,690
will kick their ass also if you've got

542
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,369
more plants inside if you're taking some

543
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,100
plants outside and then bringing them

544
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,719
back if you do leave plants inside for

545
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,399
an indoor grow make sure you treat those

546
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,220
because there's a good likelihood that

547
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,290
you will bring outdoor pests into your

548
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,420
indoor garden and cause a problem there

549
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,980
so be careful with that and also here's

550
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,180
guidance for anybody with two gardens if

551
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,740
you've got an indoor and an outdoor

552
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,210
garden if you're growing cannabis in

553
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,460
more than one location should if you've

554
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,220
got two indoor gardens try to change

555
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,960
clothes and shoes before you go from one

556
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,430
Garden to the other especially your

557
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,500
outdoor and indoor garden you don't want

558
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,660
to run from the outdoor garden to your

559
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,430
indoor garden in the same shoes and the

560
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,040
same pants and the same shirt the same

561
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,539
hat it's a good idea to change clothes

562
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,460
if you can I know it's not always

563
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,349
possible but try to kick off your shoes

564
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,299
change your pants change your t-shirt

565
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,159
put on a different hat you got

566
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,659
dreadlocks like me put up your dreads in

567
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,970
a different hat you just don't want to

568
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,290
drag problems from one Garden to the

569
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,509
other if you've got powdery mildew

570
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:52,159
you've got spider mites your shoes your

571
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,170
hat your clothes it's the greatest way

572
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,670
to move those bugs around it'll just

573
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,759
introduce problems to every garden you

574
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,289
go to try to keep in mind when you're

575
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,549
moving from one place to another if

576
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,869
you're going from your garden to your

577
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,639
friends garden to another person's

578
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,829
garden just keep in mind you're just

579
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,540
spreading garden STDs everywhere you go

580
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:10,549
keep a change of clothes in your car if

581
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:13,009
you're that kind of person do what you

582
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,210
can to stop spreading spider mites and

583
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,500
[ __ ] powdery mildew through the

584
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,809
cannabis industry

585
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,220

586
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,599
