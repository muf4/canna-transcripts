10 at seeds here now dot-com you know I

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,820
like to start the podcast off by talking

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,759
about what I'm smoking today I've been

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,829
taking dabs of lemon wreaths live batter

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,649
from our friends at Green Dot labs this

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,840
is a blend of cam Brule and secret cush

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,239
mints on the package the flavor is

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,549
described as lemon rind and tea tree oil

27
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,469
I will agree with that I'm going to say

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,560
there is also an extra funk to it I

29
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,510
really enjoy the flavor and buzz from

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,519
the lemon wreath life batter

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,290
it obviously has me talkative it's got

32
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,289
me in a really good mood so this is

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,700

for

66
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,549
nutrient mix I said this in the last

67
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,480
episode but I want to repeat it before I

68
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:32,069
start talking about my mix this nutrient

69
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:34,798
mix works for me in my environment with

70
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:36,628
my plants I don't know what strains

71
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,519
you're running I don't know what kind of

72
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:40,620
lights you're using I don't know how

73
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,090
much airflow is in your room I don't

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,209
know what's happening in your

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:49,530
environment this works beautifully for

76
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,030
me on many different setups I run this

77
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,639
nutrient mix in a commercial environment

78
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,919
and I run this nutrient mix in my own

79
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,060
personal environment and it works very

80
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,980
well pay attention to your plants no

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,870
matter what I teach you no matter what

82
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,030
the bottles teach you no matter what the

83
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,479
meters in the room tell you the plants

84
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,949
are the boss pay attention to them and

85
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,290
adjust accordingly

86
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,180
don't say Rasta jeff said to feed it

87
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,908
cal-mag i'm going to give it cal-mag

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,280
don't do that I cannot see your plants

89
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:22,009
if the plants have a problem let them

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,199
tell you what the problem is and adjust

91
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:27,170
don't force the plants to do anything

92
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,269
because it will not work

93
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,090
for you so keep in mind that everything

94
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:34,099
I am teaching you works for me you have

95
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:36,049
got to pay close attention to the plants

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,790
and make adjustments there will be

97
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,220
gametime decisions there will be

98
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,970
adjustments and I do encourage you to

99
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,700
adjust and custom tailor this recipe to

100
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,710
work for your grow and now the last

101
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,680
disclaimer that I'm going to make before

102
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:53,839
I jump into this is nobody pays me to

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,550
talk about any of these nutrients that

104
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,049
I'm going to tell you about this is all

105
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,540
stuff that I have tested and

106
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,670
experimented with and this is what I am

107
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,280
using in commercial grows throughout

108
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,530
Colorado this is what I have taught

109
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,719
people in commercial grows in Oklahoma

110
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,089
to run this is what people in Missouri

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,360
are running in commercial cultivation

112
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,619
facilities this is what people in

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,990
Massachusetts and New Mexico are running

114
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,209
based on my consultations and my setups

115
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,090
in my experience I've got people all

116
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:25,579
over the country running this exact

117
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:28,099
nutrient mix and the table type of setup

118
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,319
I explained in the previous episode so

119
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,379
my point is nobody pays me this is all

120
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,949
stuff that I use because it works for me

121
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,709
again it works for me you may have to

122
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,389
adjust some things to work for you your

123
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,279
environment may be different your lights

124
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,829
may be different your watering style is

125
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,659
probably different your strains and your

126
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,879
genetics are most likely

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,189
completely different so you will need to

128
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:56,569
make adjustments now with all of that

129
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:59,389
being said let's dive into my nutrient

130
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,980
mix my flowering plants are in three

131
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,319
gallon pots they are filled with cocoa

132
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,879
that is amended with perlite and purse

133
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,490
alight we've gone over that in the last

134
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,730
episode I'm going to water until I get

135
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:14,720
about 20% run off every time I water I

136
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:16,550
want approximately 20% run off at the

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,710
beginning of the flowering phase I'm

138
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,300
generally watering my plants every

139
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,189
morning I like to water right when the

140
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,350
lights come on so as soon as the lights

141
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,240
come on at 8 or 9 o'clock or maybe seven

142
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,340
o'clock in some places we've got a

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,710
nutrient mix ready to go the lights

144
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:32,299
click on and those plants get water I

145
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,909
like to water them right when the lights

146
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,710
come on then as they get bigger later in

147
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,930
the flowering cycle they may need

148
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,029
another watering before we leave for the

149
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,160
end of the day so I like to water them

150
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:44,359
one more time around five or six o'clock

151
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,430
so that when we come back the next

152
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,050
morning that are not crispy and dead

153
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,170
so I'm generally watering these plants

154
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,870
once or twice a day they get nutrients

155
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,730
at every watering in the previous

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,399
episode I talked about different styles

157
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,830
of mixing your nutrients you can do the

158
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,719
Monday blast where you get everything in

159
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,609
the nutrient tank Monday and the plants

160
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,410
get fed everything on Monday then the

161
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,960
rest of the week they get base nutrients

162
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,670
and maybe some cal-mag or you can do the

163
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,399
thing that I like to do where you feed

164
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,740
them a base mix every single day and

165
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,719
then you add a boost every day on top of

166
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,910
that because in my environment like I

167
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,250
said I'm watering every day so I'm able

168
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,410
to mix up a different mix on a daily

169
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,139
basis and feed my plants exactly what

170
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,850
they want every single day maybe you

171
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,680
don't have access to your plants in your

172
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,840
reservoir and your rooms as often as I

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,639
do so you've got to either mix up on

174
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,500
Monday and put everything in there and

175
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,389
feed it throughout the week maybe you

176
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,920
can feed it one big fat heavy feed on

177
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,870
Monday and then just supplement with

178
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,509
just base nutrients through the week or

179
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,939
maybe you're able to do the big base

180
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,680
nutrient mix with a boost every day like

181
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,170
I like to do that is something you're

182
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,240
going to have to figure out in my

183
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,520
example I'm going to tell you what I use

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,000
for base nutrients then I will tell you

185
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,549
what I use for boost nutrients it is up

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,660
to you to decide how you want to apply

187
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:09,379
those boosts again I mix a base mix

188
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,990
every single day then I rotate boost

189
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:14,209
products throughout the week to add to

190
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,300
that so we'll say Monday I'll mix up my

191
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,719
base we'll say that my base is 5 grams

192
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,879
of veg bloom powder one milliliter of

193
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,480
liquid lightening start and 5

194
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,279
milliliters of Ruby that is my base then

195
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,220
throughout the week I will rotate

196
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,429
through boosts so we'll say day one we

197
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,980
will use plus life on day two I will use

198
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,589
cal-mag and on day three I will use

199
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,330
lightening start then we'll just go back

200
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,639
to the top of the list and repeat that

201
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,580
through the entire week as we feed the

202
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,949
plants that is how I do my boosts you

203
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,990
may like I said a moment ago need to mix

204
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,420
up your reservoir and put that five

205
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,830
grams of Base nutrient in there the

206
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,539
lightening start the Ruby

207
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,360
and you may be adding all of those

208
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:02,449
boosters all at one time that is up to

209
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,759
you as long as the plants accept your

210
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,160
feeding properly you are not doing it

211
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,528
wrong do what works for your lifestyle

212
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,769
your grouse style your gardening style

213
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:15,649
and most of all do what works for the

214
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,440
plants throughout the flowering phase I

215
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,480
do recommend that we adjust our pH of

216
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,240
our nutrient solution to somewhere

217
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,220
between six point two and six point four

218
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,990
that's an ideal range since we are

219
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,220
working in cocoa and we're using a lot

220
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,860
of nutrients and we've got a lot of

221
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,680
fulvic acid that will be perfect for our

222
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,560
plants so through the entire process

223
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,679
adjust your pH solution to six one two

224
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,500
six point four now let's talk about the

225
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,689
actual nutrients I am using in my

226
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,480
flowering nutrient solution and I'm

227
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,790
going to go through this week by week we

228
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,730
are going to do a nine week schedule and

229
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:55,730
of course the last 10 to 14 days of that

230
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,278
schedule will be a flush with probably

231
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,620
no nutrients maybe a couple of very

232
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,419
specific products if you want to add

233
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,278
them once we get through the whole

234
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,620
lesson I will talk about a few other

235
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,659
options you can add if it suits your

236
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,730
budget and if it suits your experience

237
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,949
level and if you're comfortable adding a

238
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,089
few more things so I feel like I've been

239
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,800
teasing it I feel like I've been

240
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,250
building a lot of hype let's actually

241
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,740
discuss my flowering nutrient mix here

242
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,200
we go in the previous mix episode I

243
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,289
talked about having two different base

244
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,750
mixes we are going to do a very similar

245
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:32,240
idea in this episode and again it is

246
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,028
very important that you do not double up

247
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,289
on your base mixes what I mean by that

248
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:42,948
is I like to use veg bloom powdered

249
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:46,458
nutrients as my base in some facilities

250
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:49,370
in other facilities I am using all new

251
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:52,698
millennium bottled nutrients where I'm

252
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:56,389
using the veg bloom powder nutrients I

253
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:59,599
will subtract the new millennium base

254
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,610
mix so I have two different options for

255
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,990
base mixes and I will make them both

256
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,789
very clear in each week's mix recipe

257
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,600
most of you have probably already made a

258
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:10,490
decision you

259
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,740
no if you're going to use the veg bloom

260
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,350
powdered nutrients or you know if you're

261
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,600
going to use the new millennium liquid

262
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,819
bottled nutrients so as soon as you hear

263
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,639
the appropriate mix you will know which

264
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:24,769
recipe to follow I will make it very

265
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,480
clear for you so please follow along

266
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,659
here we go

267
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,319
for week 1 we've got two options for

268
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:37,610
base mixes let's start with that 5 grams

269
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:40,278
a veg bloom base mix per gallon of water

270
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,339
so we've got 5 grams of veg bloom per

271
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,429
gallon or if you are going to use the

272
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:49,850
new millennium bottled nutrients replace

273
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:53,899
that 5 grams with 4 milliliters of

274
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:57,680
equinox 6 milliliters of summer shift

275
00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:01,610
and 6 milliliters of autumn gold per

276
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:04,489
gallon of water now if you use the veg

277
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,579
bloom or the new millennium either way

278
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,579
you are going to add one milliliter of

279
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,629
lightening start and 5 milliliters of

280
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:15,739
Ruby

281
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:20,028
so just to recap the liquid formula is 4

282
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,750
milliliters of equinox 6 milliliters of

283
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:26,480
summer shift and 6 milliliters of autumn

284
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,519
gold that is your base then you will add

285
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,980
one milliliter of lightning start and 5

286
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,379
milliliters of Ruby per gallon to your

287
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,360
solution that is if you are using the

288
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:41,448
new millennium mix if you're using the

289
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,240
veg bloom base it will be 5 grams of veg

290
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:47,719
bloom powder one milliliter of lightning

291
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,019
start and 5 milliliters of Ruby per

292
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,829
gallon of water those are your two

293
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:58,339
options for base mixes for week 1 of

294
00:12:54,828 --> 00:13:01,309
flower now these are the boosts which I

295
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,500
would recommend adding through week one

296
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,989
I would recommend that you add a little

297
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,639
bit of cal-mag at this time I don't know

298
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,990
which brand of cal-mag you have

299
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,539
purchased I don't know which bottle

300
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,019
you've got if you were using the general

301
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:18,500
hydroponics Kali magic I recommend one

302
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:21,889
to two milliliters per gallon of cal-mag

303
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,159
as a boost in this recipe

304
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,220
then I also recommend one milliliter per

305
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,389
gallon of lightning start as a boost in

306
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,859
this recipe

307
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:37,698
I also recommend one half to one full

308
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:40,579
gram of plus life per gallon of water as

309
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:42,498
a boost in this recipe so you will have

310
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:45,438
your base mix that you will feed every

311
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:48,739
day then if you are going to rotate your

312
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:51,738
boosts you will do cal-mag at one to two

313
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:54,528
mils per gallon lightning start at one

314
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:58,339
milliliter per gallon and then plus life

315
00:13:54,528 --> 00:14:01,249
at one half to one full gram per gallon

316
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,859
and that is the week one mix now let's

317
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:07,129
move into week two of the flowering

318
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:10,009
cycle for our base mix we have got the

319
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:13,609
option we can use five grams of veg

320
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:17,918
bloom dried nutrients or you can use

321
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:21,199
five milliliters of equinox six

322
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:25,100
milliliters of summer shift and six

323
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,859
milliliters of autumn gold per gallon of

324
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,009
water so it's five milliliters of

325
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,548
equinox six milliliters of summer shift

326
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:37,339
and six milliliters of autumn gold to

327
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:40,249
that if you are using the veg bloom

328
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,829
dried mix or that veg bloom liquid mix I

329
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:46,668
just spoke of we are going to add one

330
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:49,159
milliliter per gallon of appetite from

331
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:52,999
new millennium we are also going to add

332
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,338
five mils of Ruby basically what we have

333
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:57,048
done we have increased the equinox by

334
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,509
one milliliter to add a little more

335
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:02,058
energy to the plants and we have swapped

336
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:04,159
out the Lightning start for the appetite

337
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:06,139
because I think we've got enough roots

338
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,350
at this time we're going to focus more

339
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:11,448
on the PK so that is our base mix if

340
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,788
you're using the five grams of veg blue

341
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:15,678
mix or the new millennium liquid mix

342
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:18,769
make sure to add that one mil of

343
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:22,220
appetite and five milliliters of Ruby

344
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:25,459
our boosts for week two are going to be

345
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,639
one to two mils of cal-mag one

346
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:32,688
milliliter of lightening star and one

347
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,509
half to one full gram of plus life per

348
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,870
gallon of water so weeks one and two are

349
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,639
very

350
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,610
similar the main difference is that we

351
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,350
have now introduced the appetite PK to

352
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,409
start increasing phosphorus and

353
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,409
potassium to give us fatter buds now

354
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:50,919
let's move into week 3 week 3 as when we

355
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,689
are going to add a product called shine

356
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,789
shine as part of the veg bloom lineup I

357
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,279
think that adding shine early and flower

358
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,990
will help reduce stretch so that our

359
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,210
plants don't get so stretchy for the

360
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,580
first three weeks I also think it helps

361
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,710
start speeding up bud development and I

362
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,259
know it absolutely helps start

363
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,120
developing trichomes early so let's add

364
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,710
a little bit of shine to the mix we'll

365
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,940
get more specific on that in a moment

366
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:19,430
let's focus on the base mix for week 3

367
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,790
of course you can use the veg bloom

368
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:26,329
powdered nutrients at 5 grams per gallon

369
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:29,588
or you can use the new millennium base

370
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:33,560
mix for week 3 that is going to be 5

371
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:36,440
milliliters of equinox 5 milliliters of

372
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:40,278
summer shift and we've increased to 10

373
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,370
milliliters of autumn gold per gallon of

374
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:45,379
water so that is our main base mix you

375
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,429
can either use the 5 grams of dried

376
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:51,679
nutrients or 5 milliliters of equinox 5

377
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:54,319
milliliters of summer shift and 10

378
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,079
milliliters of autumn gold but again

379
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,720
please do not mix the 5 grams and that

380
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,450
solution together that will fry the [ __ ]

381
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,400
out of your crop now whichever base mix

382
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,709
you have chosen to work with to that we

383
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,350
are going to add the 1 milliliter per

384
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:13,068
gallon of appetite and we are also going

385
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,409
to add 5 milliliters per gallon of Ruby

386
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:17,838
basically every time we mix up a

387
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,540
nutrient solution in this facility we

388
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:24,379
are going to add 5 milliliters per

389
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:26,720
gallon of water of Ruby every time so

390
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,540
we've got our base mix we've got our 5

391
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,150
milliliters of equinox 5 milliliters of

392
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:35,750
summer shift 10 milliliters of autumn

393
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,030
gold or 5 grams of veg bloom powdered

394
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,640
nutrients to that we have mixed in our

395
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:44,210
one milliliter of appetite we've added 5

396
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,360
mils of Ruby then our boosts for week 3

397
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,759
are going to be cal-mag once again we

398
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,099
will do cal-mag at 1 to 2 milli

399
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,230
per gallon I'm not sure which brand you

400
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:55,849
have purchased adjust accordingly you

401
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,190
guys pay attention to what the bottle

402
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:00,409
says read the back of the bottle maybe

403
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,150
use half of the recommended dosage and

404
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,519
pay attention to the plants and if you

405
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,100
see a cow mag deficiency coming on don't

406
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,048
try to boost it up really hard increase

407
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:11,928
it slowly and the plants will appreciate

408
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:14,960
you so our boosts are cal mag we're also

409
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:18,440
going to use one milliliter of lightning

410
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,600
start we're also going to use 1/2 to 1

411
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,360
gram of plus life per gallon of water

412
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:28,369
and this week we are going to add shine

413
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:31,219
let's add one gram of shine per gallon

414
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:34,959
of water so our boosts for week three

415
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:38,210
are cal-mag lightning star plus life and

416
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,009
shine now by the end of week three we

417
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,079
should start seeing nice bud sets little

418
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:43,849
bud developments those little dandelions

419
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,970
are popping up it is starting to get

420
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:49,639
exciting now it is time to increase the

421
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,548
appetite and increase the shine to start

422
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,660
building up those big fat buds let's

423
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:59,418
focus on the week for base mix or week

424
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,429
four you do have the option of five

425
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:06,620
grams per gallon of veg bloom base

426
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:09,259
nutrients or if you are using new

427
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:12,619
millennium liquid nutrients you can use

428
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:16,429
five milliliters per gallon of water of

429
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:19,129
equinox five milliliters per gallon of

430
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,970
summer shift and ten milliliters per

431
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,150
gallon of autumn gold so for week four

432
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,600
our base is either five grams of dried

433
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,730
nutrients or five mils of equinox five

434
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,789
mils of summer shift and 10 mils of

435
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,308
autumn gold to either one of those mixes

436
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:41,058
we are going to add two milliliters of

437
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:43,730
apatite and five milliliters of Ruby

438
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:45,558
don't forget that every time we mix up a

439
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,099
nutrient solution we are going to add

440
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:51,019
five mils of Ruby to make it worth our

441
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,789
time that Ruby works like an octane

442
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:55,730
booster or a turbocharger for our

443
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:57,889
nutrients let's be sure to add that now

444
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,950
for our boosts for week four we are

445
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:03,710
going to add 1 to 2 milliliters of

446
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,250
cal-mag we are also going to

447
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,079
one half to one full gram of + life now

448
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,579
this week we are going to increase to

449
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:15,678
two grams of shine per gallon of water

450
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:18,589
now we are working our way into week

451
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,840
five we are starting to see nice bud

452
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:22,819
development now we are going to take the

453
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,129
summer shift out of the mix we aren't

454
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:27,048
using summer shift anymore our mixes are

455
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,289
going to change a little bit let's talk

456
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:33,379
about the week five flowering feed mix

457
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:37,038
on week five of course you can use five

458
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:41,179
grams of dried veg

459
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:44,839
your base mix or you can use four

460
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:47,690
milliliters of equinox and sixteen

461
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,629
milliliters of autumn gold per gallon as

462
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,058
your base mix so your options are five

463
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,840
grams of veg bloom dried powdered

464
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:59,298
nutrients or four milliliters of equinox

465
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,720
and sixteen milliliters of autumn gold

466
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:04,788
per gallon of water but do not double up

467
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,788
again I know I keep repeating this but

468
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:10,279
do not use both base mixes because you

469
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:12,500
will cook your plants I'm giving you two

470
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,690
options because some people want to use

471
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,849
veg bloom and some people want to use

472
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,308
new millennium I find that they work

473
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,779
beautifully when you combine the two so

474
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,269
I like to use the powdered base

475
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,908
nutrients and then add in the boosters

476
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:29,058
and the add-ins from new millennium so

477
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:31,970
let's refocus our options are 5 grams of

478
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:35,210
dried nutrients or 4 mils of equinox and

479
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,669
16 millilitres of autumn gold those are

480
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,250
your options don't mix the dry and the

481
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:42,259
wet nutrients at the same time to that

482
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,380
whichever base you have chosen we are

483
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:49,700
going to add 2 milliliters of appetite

484
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:52,280
and 5 milliliters of Ruby per gallon of

485
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,240
water that is our base set up for week 5

486
00:21:52,279 --> 00:22:00,589
our boost for week 5 will be 1 to 2

487
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,819
milliliters of cal-mag 1/2 to 1 gram of

488
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:08,509
plus life and 2 grams of shine per

489
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:10,879
gallon of water now let's move into week

490
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:15,200
6 week 6 is going to be very similar

491
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,400
we've got the 5 grams of veg bloom dried

492
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,509
base nutrients

493
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,269
or four milliliters of equinox and

494
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:26,099
sixteen milliliters of autumn gold this

495
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:27,960
week we're going to increase the

496
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,419
appetite because our buds are getting

497
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,430
bigger we want a little more PK a little

498
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,019
more energy a little more beef a little

499
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,710
more chunk in there so we have now got

500
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,809
three milliliters of appetite per gallon

501
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,620
of water and as always we are going to

502
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:47,519
add the five milliliters of Ruby now our

503
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:52,109
boosts for week six are going to be one

504
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:55,650
to two milliliters of cal-mag one half

505
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:59,129
to one full gram of plus life and again

506
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,610
we are adding in two full grams of shine

507
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,590
per gallon now if you are going to have

508
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:06,809
nutrient deficiencies if you're going to

509
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:09,089
run into a nitrogen deficiency if you're

510
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,099
going to have a cal mag deficiency now

511
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,889
is really when it is going to start

512
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,139
standing out be prepared for nutrient

513
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,420
deficiencies at this point in time you

514
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,430
may have to adjust things I don't know

515
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,410
what's happening in your grow I cannot

516
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,690
see your leaves I don't know what to

517
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,820
adjust but now is the time when you

518
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,230
really need to pay close attention to

519
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,939
the plants we are getting to the home

520
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,220
stretch the plants are at high

521
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,039
performance mode this is when it is very

522
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,039
likely that you will notice the early

523
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,609
onset of nutrient deficiencies so pay

524
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,159
attention

525
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:43,109
make sure your pH is properly dialed in

526
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,790
before you water the plants make sure

527
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,189
you are taking the runoff reports I've

528
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:49,529
spoken of in previous episodes we are

529
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,360
getting really close to harvest time but

530
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,519
we are also getting to the critical time

531
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,189
where the plants will begin to show and

532
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,440
express problems so be on the lookout

533
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,740
every day be in the grow as often as you

534
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,809
can

535
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,819
looking at leaves up top looking at

536
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,829
leaves down low pay attention to your

537
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,960
grow because now we are putting these

538
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:09,299
plants in high performance mode and the

539
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,130
heat is on we are halfway through the

540
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,649
grow and we can either make it amazing

541
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,780
or we can ruin it at this point so be

542
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,280
prepared and stay on top of your game

543
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,440
don't get lazy because you've gotten

544
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,660
this far in you've got to keep crushing

545
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,450
it now let's keep me focused and work

546
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,660
our way into week seven of the flowering

547
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,000
phase in week seven you can use the 5

548
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,200
grams of veg bloom powdered based

549
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,680
nutrient mix

550
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,580
or you can use four milliliters of

551
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,730
equinox and sixteen milliliters of

552
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:44,189
autumn gold per gallon of water again

553
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,319
don't mix the five grands with the four

554
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,450
and the sixteen do one or the other

555
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,460
please I hope I can quit saying that by

556
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,830
the time we get to week nine all right

557
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,650
on top of that base mix we're going to

558
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:59,579
add four milliliters per gallon of

559
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:03,509
appetite and five milliliters per gallon

560
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:06,000
of Ruby our boosts for week seven are

561
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:09,869
going to be one to two milliliters of

562
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,730
cal-mag one half to one full gram of

563
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:16,319
plus life and two grams of shine now if

564
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,730
you were an experienced grower and you

565
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,700
know what to watch for and you're not

566
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,970
adding anything else you may be able to

567
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:27,150
increase the amount of shine you add at

568
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,549
this time I would increase slowly maybe

569
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,890
a half a gram at a time don't go more

570
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,809
than one gram but you may be able to get

571
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,180
two and a half to three grams of shine

572
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,299
into the plants at this time without

573
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,070
causing any issues that depends on how

574
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,659
much light you've got what kind of

575
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,759
plants you're growing what strains

576
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,500
you've got how they take nutrients and

577
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,379
the rest of the environment in the room

578
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,039
will also be a factor but you may be

579
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,470
able to increase the shine at this time

580
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,809
now it is time to move into week eight

581
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,000
in my gross schedule

582
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:03,419
I plan on growing these plants for nine

583
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
weeks sometimes I'm able to go for nine

584
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,070
and a half weeks but most of the time I

585
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,950
try to stick to a sixty three-day

586
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:11,939
flowering schedule if I press it too far

587
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,940
one way or the other

588
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,950
I throw the other rooms off which throws

589
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,779
the entire facility off which throws

590
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,610
production off and that ripples

591
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,529
throughout the grow we don't get back on

592
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:25,289
schedule for several months when I do

593
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:28,529
[ __ ] moves like that so I try very

594
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:31,529
carefully to keep my rooms on a 63 day

595
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:33,960
flowering schedule that means at week

596
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:37,920
eight we need to consider flushing I

597
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,039
want to get at least 10 days maybe 14

598
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,830
days of flushing out of these plants in

599
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,920
this scenario we are going to feed these

600
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:48,579
plants for

601
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,160
first four days of week eight then we

602
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:53,829
are going to transition to a flush phase

603
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,120
we are growing in cocoa so nutrients are

604
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:57,009
not hanging around

605
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,649
we are also watering the plants twice a

606
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:02,589
day which means this cocoa is going to

607
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:05,230
get rinsed out approximately 20 times

608
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:07,779
before we go to harvest we are going to

609
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,299
have plenty of flush time and plenty of

610
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,569
flush activity on these three gallon

611
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:16,569
pots for 10 days before we harvest so

612
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:19,299
before we get there let's focus on the

613
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:22,059
four days of week eight which we are

614
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:24,549
going to feed these plants there is no

615
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,829
need to add nitrogen for the last four

616
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,329
days of our feeding regimen because we

617
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:30,759
were going to work on pushing that out

618
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:33,480
of the plants right now we want to focus

619
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:36,430
on fat chunky bud development and

620
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,160
trichome development so we were going to

621
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:43,180
ditch most of the nutrients we are going

622
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,259
to focus on five millilitres of Ruby per

623
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:50,230
gallon we are also going to use ten

624
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:52,269
milliliters of winter frost per gallon

625
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,279
winter frost is from new millennium it

626
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:58,000
is time to bust out that winter frost

627
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:01,960
and add that to the mix our boosts for

628
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,259
week eight are going to be 1/2 to 1 gram

629
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,590
of plus life and 4 milliliters per

630
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:10,779
gallon of appetite so every day we are

631
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:13,689
going to get the 5 milliliters of Ruby

632
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:16,119
and 10 milliliters of winter frost then

633
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,269
we are going to do a day of plus life a

634
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,579
day of appetite a day of plus life and a

635
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:25,059
day of appetite then we are going to

636
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:28,960
begin flushing on the fifth day of week

637
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:31,569
eight that will give us day 5 6 &amp; 7 of

638
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,519
week 8 for flush and we get all of week

639
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,710
9 for flush that will give us a

640
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,990
beautiful flush our buds will taste

641
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,960
delicious they will burn nice and clean

642
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,730
we will have a wonderful product if we

643
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,710
dry and cure it properly but that's a

644
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,009
whole nother episode let's talk about

645
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:51,069
this flush phase in most cases I don't

646
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:53,769
recommend adding any products during

647
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:56,049
flush there is no reason to add anything

648
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:57,369
at this time we're trying to rinse out

649
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,658
that cocoa to where there are no

650
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,339
nutrients in there

651
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:02,080
that makes the plants starve themselves

652
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,819
then they begin to cannibalize

653
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,009
themselves they eat up all the leftover

654
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:08,558
sugars and nutrients that way our buds

655
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:11,229
taste good and our Bulls burn smoothly

656
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:14,229
so let's work on a flush all we have to

657
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:16,720
do is water the plants as needed water

658
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:18,669
them in the morning get that 20% runoff

659
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,339
water them again before you leave get

660
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:23,049
that 20% runoff then at the end of week

661
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:25,028
nine when you harvest those plants

662
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:27,668
should taste delicious and they should

663
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:30,548
burn beautifully without weird ashes and

664
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:33,129
weird aromas again that does depend on a

665
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:35,618
proper dry and cure now if you did

666
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:39,009
experience any nutrient burn any

667
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:41,949
problems during the flowering phase when

668
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:45,608
you are flushing you can use a product

669
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:48,429
called SLE f100 it is an enzyme it will

670
00:29:45,608 --> 00:29:50,439
help clean your cocoa it will help clean

671
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:52,239
out the rhizosphere during the flush

672
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,519
phase and it will help give you a

673
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:57,038
cleaner product and it will help speed

674
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,589
up the flush phase I generally don't

675
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,929
recommend a flushing agent or a flush

676
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,939
product I find that to be unnecessary in

677
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:07,239
cocoa if you're going to do something

678
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,090
like that I would use slf 100 as a NIN's

679
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:11,979
I'm but in most situations there is no

680
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:14,738
need to add anything during the flush

681
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:16,808
phase just run plenty of water through

682
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:19,149
those plants don't drown them at the end

683
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:22,418
just flush them we want to rinse out the

684
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:25,178
cocoa for the last few days of flush I

685
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:27,038
don't even a just the pH because I'm not

686
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:29,739
worried about the pH of the solution

687
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,329
because I don't need the plants able to

688
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:33,308
absorb nutrients anyway

689
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,710
adjusting the pH is all about making

690
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:37,658
nutrients available I'm not worried

691
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,639
about that for the last couple of days

692
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:41,859
I'm basically just watering the plants

693
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:43,898
to keep them alive until I choose to

694
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:47,348
give them the chop alright that is the

695
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:50,288
basic recipe for my new millennium and

696
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:52,118
veg bloom nutrient mix I did mention

697
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:54,339
that there were some things I would add

698
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:57,069
and things that more experienced growers

699
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:59,439
can add if your budget allows it if your

700
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:01,538
skill level makes you comfortable let's

701
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,929
talk about a few more things you can add

702
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:07,989
to this mix I really like a product

703
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:11,589
called decision I like to use decision

704
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:12,549
at day one of flower add it to your

705
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:16,299
nutrient mix

706
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,669
at a rate of 15 milliliters per gallon

707
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:19,659
and you will see that your plants begin

708
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,880
to flower

709
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,500
sooner than they would have if you did

710
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,580
not use decision

711
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:31,180
so I recommend decision on day 1 of the

712
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:33,579
flowering phase I would also recommend a

713
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,650
product called carbonaria that is

714
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:38,049
basically carbs to give the plants

715
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:42,240
energy I like to add carbonaria

716
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:44,829
at a rate of 5 milliliters per gallon in

717
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,329
mid-to-late flower I would start this

718
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:51,639
probably around week 4 or week 5 be

719
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:55,720
careful with the carbonaria

720
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,610
because it is sticky and goopy if you

721
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,940
are using some sort of an auto watering

722
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:04,809
system you will need to use your filters

723
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,120
also stir it up very well and put the

724
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:09,730
card in there stir the [ __ ] out of it

725
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,289
then add the shine and plus life if you

726
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,849
add them together without stirring

727
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,879
you're going to make a big ball of

728
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:18,519
funkiness so if you do use the carbene

729
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,740
area make sure you stir the [ __ ] out of

730
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,289
it and I recommend using a filter if

731
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,299
you're using an auto watering system you

732
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:27,069
folks that build the irrigation systems

733
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:30,519
you know what I mean by adding a filter

734
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:33,399
or a pre-filter I also will recommend a

735
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,950
product called bud swell bud swell is a

736
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,330
bloom booster that is mainly guano based

737
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,230
it is liquid

738
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:43,839
I recommend bud swell at a rate of 2

739
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,670
milliliters per gallon and let me back

740
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,369
up before we get carried away the

741
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:51,130
carbonaria and bud swell would be used

742
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:53,019
as a booster just add those to your down

743
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,460
the daily sheet like your Monday Tuesday

744
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,569
Wednesday maybe Wednesday you're gonna

745
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,190
add carbonaria

746
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:59,529
maybe Thursday you're gonna add bud

747
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,539
swell now just add one more booster to

748
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,660
the list and keep that in the rotation

749
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:07,089
the decision you will only use once and

750
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,860
that is the first day of flower if

751
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:10,899
you're mixing up your nutrients for the

752
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:12,849
full week you will be ok feeding that

753
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,200
through the entire first week that will

754
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:16,599
just trigger your plants to go into

755
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,880
flower that much more quickly let's get

756
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,189
back to the bud swell I think I said 2

757
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,980
milliliters per gallon and I would start

758
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,900
that at mid to late flower sometime

759
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,420
around week five or week

760
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,730
six if it fits the budget at it early if

761
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,670
you need to save a few bucks wait until

762
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,579
week six another product I like is

763
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:39,850
siliceous Elysium is silicates I

764
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:43,000
recommend two to four milliliters per

765
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:45,699
gallon of water and I recommend you can

766
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,309
use Cilicia from the time you go to

767
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,160
large veg all the way up to the time you

768
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:52,839
begin to flush i think thats illicium

769
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,550
adds a little bit of strength to the

770
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,740
plants and they recover a little more

771
00:33:54,549 --> 00:34:00,579
when we do pop and crack and twist them

772
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,700
so Cilicia at two to four milliliters

773
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:05,529
per gallon from large veg all the way up

774
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,710
to flush that product is a little pricey

775
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:10,418
that's why I say it's an add-on if it is

776
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,039
something you want to add if it's

777
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,039
something that fits the budget and if

778
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:16,570
you feel it's necessary for your grow

779
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:20,469
another product that I will recommend is

780
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:23,800
s LF one hundred at five milliliters per

781
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:25,959
gallon s LF one hundred is enzymes I

782
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,179
would recommend using that toward the

783
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,760
end of flower and during the flush phase

784
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,280
if it fits your budget maybe consider

785
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,460
using s LF one hundred once per week

786
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,220
once you go into flower and again you

787
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,530
guys these last few items are not

788
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,299
necessary these are just things for when

789
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,159
you feel comfortable with the original

790
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,500
mix if you want to step up your game a

791
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,019
little bit more if you feel like you can

792
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,199
identify a problem and correct and

793
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:54,759
adjust to problems on the fly then you

794
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,129
can step up your game a little bit and

795
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,350
add a few of these products when your

796
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,360
skill level and your budget are ready

797
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,069
that's when you can add these things and

798
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,840
I recommend you add them maybe one at a

799
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,250
time maybe have a harvest and buy

800
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,260
another bottle and then have another

801
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,789
harvest and buy another bottle you don't

802
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,610
have to buy everything all at once

803
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:14,139
slowly increase your game step up your

804
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,700
skill level step up the amount of

805
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,829
products you're using and I think your

806
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:20,559
garden will appreciate you taking your

807
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:22,389
time and building up slowly now I've got

808
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,670
one or two more things I'm going to

809
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:28,420
recommend another product I really like

810
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:30,789
is liquid karma from botanic air I use a

811
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,700
lot of liquid karma I think when I use

812
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:37,090
liquid karma and mid to late flower it

813
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:39,069
adds a little bit of funky aroma to my

814
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,400
grow it makes my cushy stuff a little

815
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,740
bit

816
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,259
cushier it makes my sweet stuff a little

817
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,328
bit sweeter I really believe that that

818
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:49,778
comes from the kelp so I would recommend

819
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:53,048
liquid karma or a similar kelp based

820
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:55,329
product for mid to late flower if you go

821
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:58,659
with liquid karma I will recommend three

822
00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:01,059
to five milliliters of liquid karma per

823
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:04,149
gallon again that would be added as a

824
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:07,119
boost in the rotation now the last thing

825
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:10,630
I'm going to recommend is a product from

826
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,390
the veg bloom lineup called push I like

827
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:16,930
to apply push as a foliar feed once per

828
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:19,690
week by itself I also add push to my

829
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:23,018
integrated pest management program any

830
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,200
time I apply a sprayed on pesticide I

831
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:28,868
add the recommended dosage of push to

832
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,960
that pesticide so if the budget allows

833
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:35,499
it I highly recommend a once a week

834
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,679
foliar feeding of a product called push

835
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:41,078
I like to apply push from the time I go

836
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,088
into those four or six inch net pots and

837
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,789
I will apply push all the way up until

838
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:47,558
week four or five of flour just

839
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:50,349
depending on how big and chunky the buds

840
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,150
have gotten once the buds are spongy and

841
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:52,749
they're able to kind of suck up some of

842
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,329
that moisture

843
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:57,009
I will not apply a foliar feed but I

844
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,099
will spray right up until they get a

845
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:02,139
little bit chunky with that push just be

846
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:03,910
very careful and don't spray big buds

847
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,929
and don't let that moisture hang around

848
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:06,699
for too long

849
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,858
don't let that air get stagnant in your

850
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:11,649
room that will give you opportunities

851
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:13,328
