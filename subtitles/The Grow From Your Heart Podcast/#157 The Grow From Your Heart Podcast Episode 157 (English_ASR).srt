95
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:19,189
medicated bacon at all the past sessions

96
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,379

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,310
and it's been four or five months since

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,729
I had eaten edibles yeah and I broke

103
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,468
that banana pudding bar in half

104
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:37,359
I ate half of it did a little selfie

105
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,800
video with Miss Lindsay here I passed

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,528
the other half of it to Lindsay I think

107
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,020
she split it with Bobo I did so I am

108
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:46,088
back on the edibles wagon I eat edibles

109
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:49,240
again if the secret session was Friday I

110
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:50,829
ate the banana pudding bar ate a couple

111
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,629
little smaller edibles that people gave

112
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,788
me like candies and such like a caramel

113
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:56,289
or something oh and then I ate something

114
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:59,978
else we're gonna talk about later on on

115
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:02,288
the show and then Saturday I ate a 100

116
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:04,180
milligram Claudie bear a cherry one

117
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:06,430
honestly not to diss any Claudie bears

118
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,379
but the cherry are absolutely not my

119
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,908
favorite flavor I didn't like the cherry

120
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,309
when it had a little bit of a mediciney

121
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:16,019
funky aftertaste the cherry that a lot

122
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:18,819
of the candy companies use has that yeah

123
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,228
prefer I like the root beer is [ __ ]

124
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,789
delicious they've got an apple one

125
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:23,050
that's really good I like the ones that

126
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,519
they and they're like a raspberry that

127
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,449
they actually dip in chocolate those are

128
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,878
[ __ ] delicious

129
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,249
but the cherry didn't it's gummy high as

130
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,539
[ __ ] I slept like a baby but I did not

131
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:35,649
like the flavor I wouldn't buy that one

132
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:37,120
again then today I ate from Gaia's

133
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:40,329
Garden edibles

134
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,209
I ate a 100 milligram milk chocolate

135
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:45,278
cherry truffle which was quite delicious

136
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,228
and I had to go slow to try to say what

137
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:52,478
that was because because it is obviously

138
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:54,610
working back in the edibles game

139
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,519
I gotta go slowly because I catch myself

140
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,050
just becoming way over medicated on the

141
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,209
edibles I can't do that to myself again

142
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,668
I don't want to get all [ __ ] ruined

143
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,778
and slow on edibles so secret session

secret session I did something that I

166
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,590
don't usually do i was given the VIP

167
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,240
gift bag forgiving us both one of those

168
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,219

169
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,300
the gift bag and talk about what's in

170
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,830

Christmas I'm gonna start with the

173
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,320
things that are least impressive to the

174
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,110
most impressive to me a company called

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,969
healing nations LLC cultivation

176
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,080
consulting cultivation systems and

177
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,590
nutrients through in a small baggie of

178
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,240
cannabis it's a little bit of buds it's

179
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,369
it's okay weed and it's not impressive

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,920
weed but it was a gift so I appreciate

181
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,750

182
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,879
but yeah they threw in some weed also

183
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,399

184
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,540
big flyer and a small baggie and they

185
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,939
threw down a pre-roll so if you guys

186
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,620
want to smoke a pre-roll joint that's

187
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,790
probably a gram and a half two grams of

188
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,610

189

that yes thank you then my next favorite

291
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:59,948
in here was from guys garden cannabis

292
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,379
creations this was a caramel apple

293
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:04,778
double karma edible this had 200

294
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:07,089
milligrams of THC and 20 milligrams of

295
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:10,088
CBD and in this little package it's one

296
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,679
of these uh like the pop top Church pop

297
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,230
it there you go on these pop top

298
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:16,119
containers there were two Tootsie Roll

299
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,428
size and shape products in there wrapped

300
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:21,428
in cellophane one of them was green it

301
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:22,988
was the Apple the other one was caramel

302
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:25,448
colored and it was obviously the caramel

303
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:26,889
I took a little nibble off the Apple it

304
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:29,498
was [ __ ] delicious it's like sour

305
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,688
apple Jolly Ranchers it tastes really

306
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,569
good and then I nibble off the caramel

307
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:36,338
and it was good but not my favorite kind

308
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:38,979
of caramel ever it was a little bit

309
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,289
milky maybe might be the description but

310
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,609
then I pinched a little of both off and

311
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:44,379
threw them both in my mouth and when you

312
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:46,089
mix that Apple and that caramel together

313
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,668
all I was [ __ ] delicious so this

314
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,549
edible is really good 200 milligrams of

315
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:53,350
THC 20 milligrams of CBD in a shop this

316
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:55,928
probably would have been a twenty dollar

317
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,308
eighteen twenty dollar edible it was

318
00:12:55,928 --> 00:13:00,149
delicious and I approved so shadow it's

319
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:02,198
a guy his garden I really liked that

320
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,308
then my favorite thing in the bag this

321
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,628
is last thing in the bag and then we'll

322
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:07,418

this new thing and then we'll actually

411
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,509
get to the main topic of this podcast

412
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,669
the new trend so I've been talking about

413
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,059
turps here in Colorado a whole bunch in

414
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:35,589
my hand I've got a half DRAM vial that's

415
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,949
a small vial those small vials with the

416
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:41,040
screw on lid I've got the shortie one ah

417
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,470
it's some ghost rain haze liquid turps

418
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,329
my friend Tim from New Mexico my friends

419
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,430
Tim and Charlie showed up from New

420
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,889
Mexico with this device that looked like

421
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,899
a large pipette it's real skinny on one

422
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,730
end and it tapers and gets thicker at

423
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,309
the other end and it's got like a

424
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,470
mouthpiece made onto it and they were

425
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,539
dunking it into the Terps and then

426
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,120
letting the excess drip off back into

427
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,129
the container and then without any fire

428
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,379
you keep it tipped down like you would

429
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,810
have straw and you just draw through

430
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,550
they call it a Terp straw just draw

431
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,619
right through it with no heat while it's

432
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:19,450
cool you pull air through it and you can

433
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:21,219
taste the turps incredibly strong and we

434
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,400
were able to put what I would normally

435
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,230
dunk onto a dab four people took two

436
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,600
good drawers off of it before the flavor

437
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,279
went away and I don't know that I got

438
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,829
any head change cuz I was already high

439
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,019
and we're smoking rosin and stuff but

440
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:37,079
it's an incredible way to experience the

441
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,329
flavor and the essence of the turps

442
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,639
without any fire or without any waste I

443
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:45,309
really thought it was cool so I was

444
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,780

taking cold sip chirps at events and

469
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,779
things in the future here I think is

470
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,620
gonna be something that will catch on

471
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:39,470

473
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,690

478
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,890
episode because that's gonna get long

479
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,538

480
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:57,350
this podcast so let's quickly go through

481
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:59,538

482
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:02,329

483
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:05,150

486
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,470
and they're just now getting through to

487
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,250
implementing regulations yeah they've

488
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,470
had stores and like zoning for a minute

489
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,630
and one of the new regulations is some

490
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,429
common strain names are going away in

491
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,630
the state of Oregon I've got a short

492
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,159
article I'm not gonna read all of it

493
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,409
because the second half the article is

494
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,760
not even related to anything involved in

495
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:34,130
what this is they just ramble on about

496
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,408
some stuff this comes from The Oregonian

497
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,270
and the headline says no more Girl Scout

498
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,000
cookies and other popular names on pot

499
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,519
packaging state says and this is by Noel

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,319
Crombie and the article goes like this

501
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,730
popular names such as Girl Scout cookies

502
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,558
in Charlotte's Web won't be allowed on

503
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,298
the labeling and packaging of medical

504
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,389
and recreational marijuana in Oregon

505
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:54,918
under rules approved by the state Friday

506
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,720
the Oregon liquor Liquor Control

507
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,549
Commission said it had reviewed about

508
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,529
500 marijuana strain names and

509
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,609
identified about 20 that may appeal to

510
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,990
children

511
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,699
commissioners saw

512
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,859
a rule change after hearing from members

513
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,900
of the public who objected to the

514
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:11,539
child-friendly names I'm gonna interject

515
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,280
here the [ __ ] is a kid doing in the

516
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,500
dispensary anyway how's a kid gonna see

517
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:24,079
that on there I think they're talking

518
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:30,319
about on the packaging at home Lindsay

519
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:32,569
is the voice of reason today one of the

520
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,369
arguments that iPod people have really

521
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:36,799
been able to get legislators around the

522
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:39,259
country to listen to and so when we get

523
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,970
to the Colorado rules in a minute the

524
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,190
reasons they were implemented are

525
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,049
essentially identical and I I agree we

526
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,320
need to keep cannabis products out of

527
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,470
the hands of children

528
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:53,808
it is a medical condition that they need

529
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,910
it right right I just don't want my kid

530
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:57,910
taking my cannabis but somebody else

531
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:02,808
getting access to my Shumate bar and

532
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,460
taking this to school and get your kid

533
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:09,250
and your kid [ __ ] freaking out at

534
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,250
school and you sue and me and the school

535
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,759
[Music]

536
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,470
I want to go fast before we totally

537
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,599
train right this [ __ ] so there's some

538
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,660
strain names being banned in Oregon now

539
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,639
and yes don't worry the the strains

540
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,320
themselves haven't been bad right right

541
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,270
yeah yeah completely there have been

542
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,980
some breather breeders have been talking

543
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,839
on Facebook forums and such about this

544
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,009
the article goes the rule approved one

545
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,419
day before the state licenses

546
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,000
recreational marijuana retailers

547
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,800
prohibits words that refer to products

548
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,650
that are commonly associated with minors

549
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,419
or marketed by minors chairman of the

550
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,920
Commission called the new requirement a

551
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,480
common-sense approach if you walk

552
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,210
through a toy store and you can identify

553
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,549
things that are straight names those are

554
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,340
probably inappropriate he said it's also

555
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,539
as simple as that the agency also won't

556
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:03,439
allow strained names that refer to

557
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,240
illicit drugs such as LSD and blow LSD

558
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,980
is just lemon Sour Diesel it's just way

559
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,660
easier to [ __ ] write and blow is a

560
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,880
stupid [ __ ] name for a straight name

561
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,669
so cool I'm gonna want Green crack yeah

562
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,350
yeah it will get to that list a list of

563
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,720
outlawed proper names

564
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:19,579
ah Girl Scout cookies Grape Ape

565
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,890
Candyland Charlotte's Web Cinderella

566
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:24,230
Doctor Who bubblicious Smurfs

567
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,690
Bruce Banner Death Star Skywalker and

568
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,220
Jedi cush those strains will still be

569
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,350
allowed in organs recreational shops

570
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,569
retailers and marijuana producers and

571
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,668
processors can use initials or some

572
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:37,460
others shorthand reference instead of

573
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:39,440
the full strain name okay yes so let's

574
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:44,360
say it doesn't have to get renamed or

575
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,788
anything right yeah but it's pretty

576
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,928
gentle but it's also pretty silly it is

577
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:50,929
kind of silly but you can't have

578
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:52,038
Skywalker or Jedi Kush okay I mean I

579
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,380
don't know how they're doing it in

580
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,480
Oregon but in Colorado it's blocked

581
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,190
printed in black lettering that's how

582
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,808
the screen name gets printed on pretty

583
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,390
much every product that leaves a legal

584
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:04,428
dispensary I mean it's never down the

585
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,250
front with the toys-r-us logos different

586
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:11,210
colors what's fought for kids eyes it's

587
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:15,859
just computer printed on a packaging

588
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:20,000
label with okay let me be the voice of

589
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:24,469
reason again we are still able to

590
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:35,569
legally buy weed in the shop so is it

591
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:38,329
that because you're a hundred percent

592
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:40,069
right I just feel like in the in the

593
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:43,189
Marin excuse me in the marijuana

594
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:46,099
industry and community we have such

595
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,169
bigger battles to be fighting than the

596
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:49,788
fact that we can't use the name Girl

597
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:52,130
Scout cookies I'm not being mean I'm

598
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:54,349
just saying like to me it just feels

599
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,690
like we can all buy illegal weed like I

600
00:23:54,349 --> 00:24:00,558
get it it's a bummer and it's a big deal

601
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:04,730
but at the end of the day it's not like

602
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,440
you have to rename the strain to be you

603
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,779
know something completely ridiculous

604
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,490
that that's nothing to do with cookies

605
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:12,950
you know what I'm saying like they're

606
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,019
not saying you can't use any cookie name

607
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,600
or any they took like 20 names out of

608
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:20,929
500 which in the grand scheme of things

609
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:25,609
is probably so much do you think Bounty

610
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:28,220
Killer would make this list the Bounty

611
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:29,839
Killer mad aloud I feel like a la

612
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,589
I feel like a lot of like Colorado

613
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:36,079
strains would be bald I was thinking

614
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:38,418
about the different ones we've care or

615
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,279
I've had on a shelf in front of me I've

616
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,070
been working in the legal industry I

617
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,808
think about maybe 20% of them oddly

618
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:48,798
enough Green crack is not on this list

619
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:50,418
yeah when I read the list I was like

620
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,750
well there's a bunch missing like if

621
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:55,610
this is the criteria so maybe they just

622
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,759
got the super blatant ones and they left

623
00:24:55,609 --> 00:25:00,619
the others girls make sense for sure I

624
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,500
was when you said then I was like oh

625
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,298
that makes absolute sense that's a

626
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,220
children organization Grape Ape

627
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:10,509
Candyland Charlotte's Web that's all

628
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,798
children stop selling kids book

629
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,829
characters there's a company that's

630
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,690
spent on us a fortune in like half a

631
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:19,519
decade marketing Charlotte's Web around

632
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,529
the country right yeah [ __ ]

633
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,788
Cinderella I mean oh absolutely

634
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,440
so Girl Scout cookies we're just gonna

635
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,970
call that GSC and it also says

636
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,769
derivative strains you can't use

637
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,720
Platinum Girl Scouts or Thin Mints

638
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,029
either yep so Ulsan then you probably

639
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,600
can't use dos eidos Dossey dozer band

640
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,129
well yeah every I I saw something the

641
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:41,990
other day that was snickerdoodle is the

642
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:44,240
screen name the fruit names I mean how

643
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,429
many different ones vaguely meet like an

644
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,150
item a kid might have for dessert also

645
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:51,710
right sour lemon sherbert doctor who was

646
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,538
taken because it's a fictional character

647
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,480
currently marketed to children basically

648
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:58,099
any fictional character like I was when

649
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,038
I first read this I was like well some

650
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,428
jackass made an Obama crush like is that

651
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,408
gone too because kids know the president

652
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:08,000
like I mean how far they go on with this

653
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:09,500
particular and that's why I have an

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,140
issue with it because as a regulation

655
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,690
it's a little bizarre right I'm like you

656
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,909
can ban cartoons from the name or from

657
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,470
the logo you can do a lot of other

658
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,620
things to make sure that the products

659
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,360
the target children but banning stuff

660
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,619
that's gonna be like just words in black

661
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,629
print like some of them makes a little

662
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,459
bit of sense but some of its it's just

663
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,140
gonna be a regulatory pain in the ass

664
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,850
down the road for sure just more hoops

665
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,259
to jump through just just more bitching

666
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,418
and complaining for them to do about

667
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,220
campuses a lot of it's subjective

668
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,679
yeah and that's what makes it a

669
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,240
regulatory issue in my mind any

670
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,090
get to some Colorado rules here in just

671
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,319
a second that it's not subjective let's

672
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,599
let's jump right to that then that's a

673
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,638
good segue Mike since we're like 27

674
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,808
minutes in let's get to this about

675
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:54,118
halfway through the show it's a perfect

676
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,599
time to move on to my my favorite topic

677
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:57,538
of the show

678
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:00,178
Colorado recently until a few days ago

679
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,158
until the first I was allowed to walk

680
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,619
into a dispensary a medical dispensary

681
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,059
or recreational dispensary and I was

682
00:27:04,618 --> 00:27:08,519
able to buy without any special

683
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,808
paperwork I think to the best of my

684
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,638
knowledge I was allowed to buy two

685
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:13,490
ounces of concentrates I means I could

686
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:16,888
buy two ounces of shatters that correct

687
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,899
Lindsey says yes mike exactly in a

688
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:21,148
medical shop yes in a wreck shop just

689
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:22,739
the one okay so in a medical shop I

690
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:24,479
could get my two ounces I'm a medical

691
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,339
patient and a recreational shop I was

692
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,860
allowed to buy one ounce concentrate

693
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,599
which is is enough concentrate that's

694
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:32,908
that's not a lot of concentrate I mean

695
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,308
if you're me I mean but there was

696
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:38,450
[ __ ] two pounds of [ __ ] rosin on

697
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:41,730
this tables two couple of days ago but

698
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:44,278
announcer two is a substantial amount

699
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,389
and now the new rule is no matter who

700
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:51,089
you are no matter where you're shopping

701
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:52,709
eight gram limit the original I'm pretty

702
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:56,730
sure that's on the medical side too I'm

703
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:58,440
pretty sure it's just wreck I'm uh the

704
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,649
article that I read has misled me and

705
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,580
I'm glad you guys have corrected me um

706
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:04,498
recreational for a hundred percent sure

707
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,359
you can only buy eight grams of

708
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:11,009
concentrate now and there are other

709
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:12,359
rules for edibles and think other items

710
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,110
that are sold by the milligram like

711
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,908
edibles and vape pen cartridges so if

712
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:19,319
I'm not mistaken I'm doing this from

713
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,769
memory everybody else's are fun out

714
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,599
cheater notes back check for the

715
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,878
audience fact checking like Wow right

716
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,099
now you keep talking go slow uh edible

717
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:30,898
and vape pen limit is now eight hundred

718
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:35,459
milligrams it used to be twenty eight

719
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:39,768
hundred and concentrate limits are now

720
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:43,860
was seven or eight eight eight grams a

721
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:46,558
concentrate is that edible limit changed

722
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,819
on the medical side as well I don't as

723
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,038
far as I know these are just

724
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:51,529
recreational rules I think the only

725
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,710
thing that changed

726
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:58,609
medicos I was compliant some edible

727
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:03,380
compliance labeling rules and imprinting

728
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:05,479
on bars so there are two different rule

729
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,280
changes in cholera three different rule

730
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,329
changes in Colorado one limits what

731
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:16,450
people can buy one limits the shape of

732
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:19,189
certain gummies yeah animals period and

733
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,630
but mostly affecting gummies right now

734
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,580
market wide and then the last rule is

735
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,430
edibles in Colorado now the actual item

736
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:34,579
has to carry a stamp and I actually took

737
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:37,269
notes today post had an interview with

738
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:40,669
Larry wolf the head of the Department of

739
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:43,670
Colorado Health and Environment the CDP

740
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:48,410
AG and somebody from the top of the meed

741
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:52,430
the marijuana Enforcement Division the

742
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:54,080
edible symbols there's two exceptions so

743
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,060
like every piece of chocolate has to

744
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,029
carry a little if it's recreational and

745
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:00,859
yellow diamond with the letters THC

746
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:04,430
exclamation point in it and the medical

747
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:11,240
just has the M right for medical no it's

748
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:13,610
the same diamond and it has to say th oh

749
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,019
they might have dropped the color that

750
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,279
was one of the original things and

751
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,799
people were like well how do we make it

752
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,180
yellow on a brownie without frosting or

753
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,799
somesuch it took a while for some

754
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,690
companies to get this implemented I've

755
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,879
seen one company that they just made a

756
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,759
disk out of sugar so it's a hundred

757
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,080
percent edible but it has the logo on it

758
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,339
and then they've affixed it to the top

759
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,609
of their product with like melted

760
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:38,299
marshmallow it is weird in practice but

761
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:40,279
it's pretty tasty but the only

762
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:44,029
exceptions to carrying that symbol are

763
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:46,339
liquids the liquids manufacturers

764
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:48,740
managed to get the legislature to see

765
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:52,159
reason and make a specific exception for

766
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:55,339
liquids so that you know you you can't

767
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,110
stamp a liquid and they were literally

768
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,730
tough for a while talking about making

769
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,389
it having gold style show longer

770
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,500
floaties that said THC in it or some

771
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,320
such

772
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,929
or only doing single serving packages of

773
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,879
liquids so it could only come in a 10

774
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,640
milligram serving recreationally which

775
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,850
would pretty much kill recreational

776
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,409
liquids but they carved out an exception

777
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:20,869
it can still be a hundred milligram

778
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,850
liquid container as long as the

779
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:26,329
measuring device is part of that

780
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:28,839
container and stuff like granola now has

781
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:31,038
to come in single serving packages

782
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:32,449
anything like any edible that can't

783
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,029
carry the snap has to come in

784
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,308
individually individual serving size

785
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:40,490
packages with the label affixed to that

786
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:42,798
packaging so that you can't leave it on

787
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,919
a table and somebody come along and pick

788
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:48,668
it up okay which is a felony in its own

789
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,038
right before we came up with the label

790
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,659
it's still a felony with the label it's

791
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:56,200
like leaving a loaded gun on the table

792
00:31:53,659 --> 00:32:01,850
like it's it's wildly inappropriate

793
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:04,580
adult behavior yeah that's the basic

794
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:06,288
edible rundown did you find yes the

795
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,548
article I had to go through three

796
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:10,009
articles to actually find the truth

797
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:12,440
medical marijuana will remain unchanged

798
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:14,179
only one article said that the first

799
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,038
article that I was reading was actually

800
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,750
sponsored by a dispensary so they were

801
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:19,099
trying to leave medical marijuana out on

802
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,450
purpose I think because of the way that

803
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,949
it was worded it totally made it look

804
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,830
like it was happening all over the board

805
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,850
so I'm glad I'm glad that the medical

806
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:32,269
market industry's been talking about

807
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:38,269
this for a year now felonies for the

808
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:40,700
past four days just me this weekend so I

809
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:42,798
was the only one commitment felonies a

810
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,710
lot of people are sweating this because

811
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:49,490
so far in Colorado not a single licensed

812
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,480
dispensary has screwed up the purchase

813
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:56,690
limit rule no one's been cited or fined

814
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,509
for selling over the limit yet yeah I

815
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:03,140
was only been a couple days well no

816
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:06,140
we've always had period in Colorado no

817
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,730
shop has been cited for that and that's

818
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,150
sort of it's one of those little random

819
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:13,639
points of pride for a while our team our

820
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,589
teen ID checks things where we were in

821
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:17,658
9 percent which is unheard of in liquor

822
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:19,368
tobacco yeah and we were real proud of

823
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:21,859
that and then we had one bad round and

824
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:24,618
got knocked down to 92 just like alcohol

825
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:27,228
and tobacco and that hurt but they don't

826
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:29,118
even check alcohol and tobacco they do

827
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:33,078
but it's not nearly what they do with

828
00:33:29,118 --> 00:33:35,509
with marijuana they were doing it was a

829
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:37,759
real ID in the person and the ID was

830
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:40,308
wearing a hat and the person checking

831
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,399
the ID was supposed to catch that that

832
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:45,108
was the last ID sting that I heard about

833
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,078
performed on a marijuana store that's

834
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:50,058
sketchy trying to [ __ ] with us I know

835
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:50,628
that's checking compliance to the nth

836
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:53,898
degree

837
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:55,788
marijuana shops also face ten times the

838
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:58,728
fine that a tobacco or alcohol retailer

839
00:33:55,788 --> 00:34:00,648
would of course um it's ten grand if you

840
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:02,419
add so cigarettes or alcohol to somebody

841
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:04,398
underage is the possible fine with

842
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,929
marijuana that's a hundred that could

843
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,218
ruin a business yeah I could just close

844
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:08,659
you down no matter how big your

845
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:10,490
dispensary is a hundred thousand or fine

846
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,169
cuz I guess that way can be careful

847
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,668
alright so now that's why one of the

848
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:15,408
reasons that never have recreational

849
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:17,808
shoppers can now only buy eight grams

850
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,338
yep does that mean that people that come

851
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:20,809
to do that means the ounce Till's are

852
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:22,940
gonna go away at the REC shops no more

853
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:27,379
cheap ounce deals because you can't buy

854
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,940
an ounce of hash yeah I'm just cheap

855
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:30,139
because I mean you'd see concentrate

856
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,148
deals for like four twenty five hundred

857
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,210
forty pounds well and there's no end

858
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:37,338
either and so you can't get your your

859
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,048
limit in flour and your limit in hash

860
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:40,818
and your limit in edibles there's

861
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:42,349
actually a chart that's been going

862
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:44,058
around that shows how the breakdown is

863
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:45,649
how many grams of hash equals how many

864
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,720
grams of flour how many grams of

865
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:49,128
milligrams of edibles equal how many

866
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,798
grams of flour I don't pay attention the

867
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:53,568
charts I'm not working at a budtender

868
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:55,639
station there was this great like three

869
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,318
month period where bud tenders didn't

870
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,230
have to do pointless math in their head

871
00:34:57,318 --> 00:35:02,298
all day long like counting to seven over

872
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,099
and over in different fractions

873
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,108
depending on what the order was or

874
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,420
whatever we was just twenty eight was

875
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:10,278
the limit and it was real simple and now

876
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,159
there's this that they are we all have

877
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:15,230
to keep in our heads it sucks just more

878
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,649
regulation to follow do you think is

879
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:23,449
just gonna make people go to more stores

880
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:24,980
people that are smurfing yeah but this

881
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,449
rule really isn't for them there hasn't

882
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,009
been a lot of that that's why they just

883
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,939
recently upped the out-of-state purchase

884
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:32,509
limit to an ounce

885
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,769
okay when this rule was originally

886
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,358
passed they were talking about out of

887
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:38,808
Staters can only buy one and a half

888
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,068
grams a hash I laughed the first time I

889
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,539
read it because I looked down at my case

890
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:44,869
and I was like everything comes in one

891
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:46,880
gram containers yeah you can buy one

892
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,170
gram or we've got to talk to all our

893
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,088
distributors and see if they can do I

894
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,818
have Zeo

895
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:54,108
but they hammered it out and then just

896
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,489
recently a couple months ago they upped

897
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,808
that limit so on I don't think they're

898
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,729
worried about smurfin they're just

899
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,130
somebody in the legislature was like

900
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,659
wait we let people buy 28 grams a hash

901
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:09,798
or 208 what was it 2,800 grams of

902
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:11,778
edibles it's 28 of the 280 of the most

903
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:13,460
potent edibles sold in a wreck shop well

904
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:17,210
I have to [ __ ] ton of edibles

905
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,358
yeah I've seen people leave the spot

906
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,159
with [ __ ] bags I used to every now

907
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,929
and again I say I'll go get you a box or

908
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,278
yeah I mean it happens throughout the

909
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:31,750
industry security would follow them to

910
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:34,278
the car but it happens from time to time

911
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,289
it's just one of those things and now

912
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,608
with these new limits it's just anybody

913
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,589
that's looking to do that it's just

914
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,630
gonna have to make more stops but it's a

915
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,650
weird set of rules like you can tell

916
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,298
it's not the same group of people

917
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,588
writing all of these can I ask you a

918
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:47,150
completely random question that's off

919
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:48,349
topic sure you guys have both been bud

920
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,910
tenders you have plenty of experience

921
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:52,460
behind the bud counter and ringing

922
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:55,068
people up what is the largest ticket you

923
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:59,088
have ever rung up a single person for my

924
00:36:55,068 --> 00:37:00,949
largest personal take yeah 700 damn at a

925
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:05,028
rec shop yep okay

926
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:07,250
lenz do you remember do you want to say

927
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:08,690
it does it beat Mike 1,700 and I'm

928
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,670
pretty sure man

929
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:17,088
it's a medical shop you can buy so much

930
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:19,849
more do I know the purchaser I can't I

931
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:21,619
can't do that because different rules

932
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,809
that I do that's true I just work it

933
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,400
like basically a store in the mall are

934
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,530
the rules I follow other than the

935
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,789
d checks she works in a medical shop

936
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,840
this she's gonna write down the numbers

937
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:36,800
she's gonna write it down and we're

938
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,050
gonna gasp she just kept typing zeros

939
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,940
what the [ __ ] okay she's got me beat by

940
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:46,850
an order of magnitude folks it's five

941
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:49,970
digits yes that's but I hope that came

942
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:58,759
was just gonna ask if anybody tipped you

943
00:37:49,969 --> 00:38:00,109
or to carry you for that right those

944
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:08,180
frugal people's how they have all that

945
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:09,920
extra money it'll [ __ ] tip the secret

946
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:15,619
session that's weird we didn't see Molly

947
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:25,460
I just realize that Molly had fun she

948
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:27,139
was hiking somewhere excitement hope you

949
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,639
had a great time Mike did you get to

950
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,379
cover all of your edible stuff that you

951
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,509
wanted to talk about um I thought I

952
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,190
think I hid all the new rule changes we

953
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:40,160
covered the the purchase limit we

954
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:43,519
covered that oh shapes are changing you

955
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:47,690
can no longer do human shapes animal

956
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,670
shapes fruit shapes anything that

957
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,630
resembles a candy that's on the shelves

958
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:56,570
yeah or anything that's identical to its

959
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:59,930
non-medicated market counterpart so all

960
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:01,400
of your gummies are now squares Oh which

961
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:03,139
works out well cuz it's really easy to

962
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,980
imprint the new symbol into a ruler

963
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:09,769
yep what else how are they handling the

964
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,199
sodas you can still do 100 milligram

965
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:16,929
beverages in the rec market the

966
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:20,299
container has to carry the new label and

967
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:22,969
the dosing instruments so it has to come

968
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,500
with like a an equal medicine top okay

969
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:27,500
so that you can dose out your 10

970
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,420
milligram dose that's how do we chats

971
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,119
with your friends that's pretty much a

972
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,500
sign when I was selling those all day

973
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,389
have you ever drank like the can

974
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,119
apologize to Keith's Cola oh yeah do you

975
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:40,989
feel like you get high more quickly to

976
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,989
liquids definitely

977
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,400
and your your stomach doesn't have to

978
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,469
break down the brownie yeah right it's

979
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,849
just absorbable quicker it's like you

980
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:52,019
drink it and then you go to do whatever

981
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,170
you're doing and then you turn your head

982
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:57,389
to one way to look at something to go

983
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,570
hole-high with can a punch check the

984
00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:06,059
label there's a range of THC in the can

985
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:09,019
of punches I drink a 200 to check the

986
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,799
back of the label it might be like - 30

987
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,110
milligrams I'm gonna make a difference

988
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,450
in the rack market there's like it's a

989
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,539
10 15 20 milligram swing that you can

990
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:23,279
see on the back of those in fact as soon

991
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:25,380
as we get done here on the table and I

992
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,330
was really pumped to see that it had lab

993
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,130
testing for potency on the back that's

994
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,349
the medicals coming along with that and

995
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,789
I love to see it

996
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,259
totally random interjection there pretty

997
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:36,150
soon everything will be lab tested go

998
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,580
ahead we had a customer appreciation day

999
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,670
at the shop and I chug to Keith's Cola

1000
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,699
100 milligram orange soda before it not

1001
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:52,230
thinking like anything of it and I was

1002
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:54,149
like 45 minutes and I remember a

1003
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,579
conversation I had with buzzy a couple

1004
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,440
days before that about how like drinks

1005
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,449
are sublingually and they like hate you

1006
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,309
harder and I was like wow you're an

1007
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:04,169
idiot Lindsey you just chug that thing

1008
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:08,519
right before you came in not even like

1009
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,409
it didn't taste that hash she said we

1010
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,570
got a bunch of 10 milligram samples at

1011
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:15,149
one point and I took the four flavour

1012
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,500
samples we got home and without thinking

1013
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,570
about it drank all four of them and

1014
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,539
liked it jot it down a little flavor

1015
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:25,230
review about each one and just myself

1016
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:29,190
I like being edible ruined to an extent

1017
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,960
yeah I think about 250 milligrams right

1018
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,789
now is just about perfect for me I don't

1019
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,659
want to go too much far faster because

1020
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:36,360
that's when I started getting a little

1021
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:37,889
goofy start getting a little hazy but

1022
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:44,010
I'm back on the edible horse so when I

1023

1024
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:52,240

1026

social media Mike ID neo-punk 15 on

1036
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:49,599
Twitter or on Facebook you know when I

1037
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,858
wrote this episode when I wrote the

1038
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,720
notes I really thought that everybody

1039
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,920
was limited to 8 grams of purchasing so

1040
00:42:52,719 --> 00:43:10,480
it really changed the impact of my

1041
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:11,769
attitude of this show coughing syllable

1042
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,619
words are hard you guys we're making up

1043
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,699
our own words here in the podcast

1044
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,410
get your own podcast set up some

1045
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:18,669
microphones get a feed and you can make

1046
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:19,808
up your own words just say them into the

1047
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,579
microphone there's got to be some sort

1048
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,319
of rule if you say a word more than 6 or

1049
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:28,359
7 or 12 times and it's got to be a word

1050
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:30,608
now competitions I can say rational yeah

1051

not knowing the answers to some things

1091
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:12,088
people have asked me to do an episode

1092
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,710
about LED lighting I personally have

1093
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:15,929
never grown with LEDs I don't know [ __ ]

1094
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,068
about LEDs I've got two friends they

1095
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:19,529
claim they're gonna drive from Denver

1096
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:21,150
and do an LED episode with me battle boy

1097
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,440

1098
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,059
him personally the other guy I don't

1099
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,548
know so I don't know if I can get him to

1100
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,990
drive he lives about 130 miles from here

1101
00:45:26,548 --> 00:45:29,849
if he's willing to drive to the podcast

1102
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,989
I'd love to get him on so maybe I'll get

1103
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:33,359
both of those cats on and we'll do a

1104
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:34,919
quick episode about LED lighting also

1105
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:39,900
I'm trying to get in touch with the guy

1106
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,280
that makes the 315 s I think I commented

1107
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,990
on one of his Facebook post he did not

1108
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,880
reply I'm not even sure it's the right

1109
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:47,308
dude so I'm gonna get in touch with the

1110
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,930
dude that makes it 3:15 the LEC is the

1111
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:50,130
light emitting ceramic so we'll get that

1112
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,649
guy on the podcast we'll talk about

1113
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,108
those in the future also check this out

1114
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,360
you guys have asked for an episode about

1115
00:45:55,108 --> 00:46:00,329
cannabis and pregnancy

1116
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,970
I have done a lot of research there is

1117
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:04,409
so much stuff out there I honestly I'm

1118
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,299
not qualified to do an episode about

1119
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:09,629
cannabis and pregnancy I'm not a doctor

1120
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,010
I I'm not a woman and those are two

1121
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,390
things that I feel like I should be at

1122
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,320
least one of to do an episode about

1123
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:19,319
pregnancy if you are either a doctor or

1124
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,120
a woman or a woman doctor or if you've

1125
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,260
got experience with cannabis and

1126
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,639
pregnancy you know more than I do and

1127
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,560
you're more comfortable with the subject

1128
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:28,019
I'd love to get you on we could talk all

1129
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,880
about it yeah I do only thing I could

1130
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,289
throw in on that topic is the relevant

1131
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,460
laws you might be breaking and the

1132
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:37,320
repercussions you might face legally and

1133
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,619
how that system works in places like

1134
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,330
Colorado because I used will know I used

1135
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,309
to read this all the time and in

1136
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:46,980
patients charts when I work with locked

1137
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:48,929
up teens so it's something that's gonna

1138
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,500
follow your kid around for that life oh

1139
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:54,179
man um if the hospital chooses to drug

1140
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,610
test you or your baby during the

1141
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:59,129
delivery and if you've got dreadlocks or

1142
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,990
if you look like me as soon as it comes

1143
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,690
out for the for the most part the system

1144
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:05,699
works it's just if anybody involved in

1145
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:09,450
the birthing process like that whole

1146
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:12,269
hospital stay decides so yeah let's drug

1147
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:14,730
test that mom and that baby then it

1148
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:18,389
happens and it's just if anybody happens

1149
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,789
to make that decision the local anti-pot

1150
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:23,579
group down here they're working with one

1151
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:25,079
of the hospitals and one they've got one

1152
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,730
month worth of data and they're like

1153
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,029
half the babies we tested came back

1154
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:32,070
positive for THC and that's the end of

1155
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:34,019
their statement if you dig a little

1156
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,519
deeper ten babies were tested during

1157
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,710
that period five of them came back

1158
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:42,059
positive for THC doesn't tell you what

1159
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:43,019
was up with the other five but it's part

1160
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,880
of the National legalization

1161
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:46,199
conversation like it could be a cool

1162
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,809
episode we can find the right people

1163
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,359
yeah I'm I don't have it's not my

1164
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:52,920
wheelhouse I guess you know I literally

1165
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,720
just had to look up all of these laws

1166
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,090
because like I worked in the league or

1167
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,730
work in the legal industry and had a kid

1168
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:01,289
while I did that right what do you do

1169
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,760
both of you who have been but tenders

1170
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,139
Mike I don't know if we should or no

1171
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,520
longer a budtender you worried but

1172
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,409
tender Lindsay is about tender what do

1173
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:10,110
you do if a pregnant customer comes in

1174
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:11,068
and tries to buy cannabis it's perfectly

1175
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,739
legal

1176
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:16,739
to purchase it because he it will like

1177
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:18,650
what happened with us is that I don't

1178
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:20,519
are we gonna do this for this show

1179
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,660
there's just something you brought up

1180
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:24,868
randomly and all of a sudden this is

1181
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:36,208
like a two-hour show now quick answer

1182
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:38,880
what happens if absolutely they serve

1183
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:40,409
turn no issues look when my wife was

1184
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,459
pregnant she stopped at the gas station

1185
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:42,868
a couple of times and bought me

1186
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:44,009
cigarettes and like the second time she

1187
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:47,219
did it she's like I if I could doing

1188
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:48,568
that again what like I just wasn't

1189
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,528
paying attention it's just something

1190
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:52,558
she's done for forever

1191
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:54,659
and I was like what and as I said what I

1192
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,789
was like oh people judges yeah it

1193
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,248
probably looks like there's a whole

1194
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:00,869
bunch of stuff that you doctor tells you

1195
00:48:59,248 --> 00:49:02,518
you shouldn't consume or do while you're

1196
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:05,278
pregnant and it's all legal

1197
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:07,368
well not all cuz like heroin and coke

1198
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:10,440
and [ __ ] around that way right but like

1199
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:18,209
99% of it's legal and it's just not

1200
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:20,519
advised so well if you are please you

1201
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,568
know or even have more education on it

1202
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:23,488
than I do and you're more comfortable

1203
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:26,489
talking about it than I am I feel like

1204
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:27,749
that's more of a woman's topic and I

1205
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:29,099
should have a woman involved in this to

1206
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:30,358
help me through this so that I don't

1207
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:34,048
sound like a sexist dude that's

1208
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,699
uneducated so let's get a doctor or or a
