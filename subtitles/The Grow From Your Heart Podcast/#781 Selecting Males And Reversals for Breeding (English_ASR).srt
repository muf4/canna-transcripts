00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,279
in this episode I'm going to talk a

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,200
little bit about selecting male plants

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,420
for breeding we might touch on selecting

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,160
plants for reversals before we get to

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,960
that part of the show let's do a few

available all right I don't want to

59
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,598
ramble too much here at the top of the

60
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,939
podcast I do want to talk about

61
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,619
selecting male plants for breeding we

62
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,719
may also touch a little bit about on

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,819
selecting plants for reversals which is

64
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,739
when I take a female plant treat it with

65
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,780
a solution that does make it make pollen

66
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,000
that pollen of course only makes female

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,640
seeds we may touch a little bit about on

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,120
how I select a plant for that let's jump

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,518
right into it how do I select plants for

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,620
breeding let's talk about breeding one

71
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,480
thing I'm going to say a lot here is

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,159
have a goal when it comes to breathing

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,079
if you don't have a goal when it comes

74
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,699
to breeding you're just pollen chugging

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,379
you wouldn't go into the kitchen without

76
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,238
some sort of goal and just pour a bunch

77
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:58,919
of [ __ ] in a bowl and mix it up and hope

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,360
that it tastes good that's kind of the

79
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,559
same thing if you just put plants in a

80
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,480
room and just throw plants in there and

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,580
let them do the thing you have no goal

82
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,659
no idea no path that's just Paul and

83
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
Chuck and they're doing the same thing

84
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,318
with the plants you may make some good

85
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,000
[ __ ] but also who knows you may not make

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,699
some good [ __ ] put some thought into it

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,219
have a strategy have a plan have a goal

88
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,658
write down that goal if you don't have a

89
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,759
clear Target how do you know if you're

90
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,259
hitting that Target if I'm saying I want

91
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,060
to hit that dot right there on the wall

92
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,919
with the ball and I throw the ball I

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,420
know I hit it if I throw the ball and it

94
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,339
goes way over there I know I need to

95
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,199
adjust and come this way then I can hit

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,120
my goal do the same thing with your

97
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,759
breeding project write down a goal write

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,620
down a Target see how close you get be

99
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,598
real with yourself and then adjust from

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,180
there so the first thing I'm going to

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,098
recommend in any any breeding project in

102
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,140
almost any project in life and anything

103
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,359
you're working on before you get started

104
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,399
have a goal and a desired outcome and

105
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,239
know what you're getting into the next

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,920
thing I'm going to talk about

107
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,039
understanding when it comes to breeding

108
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,958
is learn about Mendel charts understand

109
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,818
what Gregor Mendel was trying to teach

110
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,319
us there's a lot of good information in

111
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,079
Mendel charts all you have to do is

112
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,878
Google Mendel chart or Gregor Mendel a

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,440
lot of info will come up we may do an

114
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,780
episode here on this podcast but there

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,818
are plenty of videos about Mendel charts

116
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,438
out there Mendel charts will help you

117
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,179
far in your breeding they will help you

118
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,798
predict the outcome of your breeding

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,180
projects they'll help you see if you're

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,738
going to reproduce something that's

121
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,780
already been done they'll help you

122
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,339
isolate traits you're looking for when

123
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,439
it comes to line breeding in the future

124
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,539
Mendel charts will definitely help you

125
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,459
predict the outcome and anticipate

126
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,259
outcomes of your breeding projects

127
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,579
you'll have to learn about dominant and

128
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,800
recessive traits you'll learn about

129
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,359
co-dominant traits you will learn a lot

130
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,280
through Mendel charts and through the

131
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,680
practice of breeding will all make sense

132
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,659
once you put it into practice

133
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,639
so learn about Mendel charts learn about

134
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,740
dominant co-dominant and recessive

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,418
traits understand alleles and how

136
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,939
alleles are expressed and passed through

137
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,579
plants then learn which alleles you are

138
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,600
looking for in your breeding project by

139
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,339
this point you've got a good

140
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,220
understanding of what you want to create

141
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,079
and how to go about creating it one

142
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,479
thing I want to touch on is select your

143
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,698
plants by plant appearance and plant

144
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,039
traits don't select your plants based on

145
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,840
names we are not breeding names just

146
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,340
because two plants have cool names and

147
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,319
if you put those two names together you

148
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,000
get an even cooler name that does not

149
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,740
mean that those plants need to be bred

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,779
with we're not breeding names we're not

151
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,639
breeding for social media pictures we

152
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,258
are breeding biological material which

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,900
has to work well in a breeding project

154
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,759
with good results so Focus your breeding

155
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,560
more on the things you see from the

156
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,720
plants the things you observe and enjoy

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,519
more than the hype and the name and

158
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,580
things like that then you will have much

159
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,439
better success in your breeding project

160
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,959
so learn about Mendel charts understand

161
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,060
what Gregor Mendel was teaching us then

162
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,038
learn about dominant and co-dominant and

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,720
recessive traits learn about how those

164
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,639
traits are passed from plant to plant

165
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,800
understand as much as you can

166
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,259
biologically about these plants which we

167
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,060
are going to breed with then here's

168
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,639
another huge piece of advice once you

169
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,199
understand the Mendel charts the traits

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,180
the dominant the co-dominant the

171
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,740
recessive traits how these things meld

172
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,259
together when we are breeding once you

173
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,180
understand that forget all of that and

174
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,160
breed with love breed with passion and

175
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,840
grow from your heart once you understand

176
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
all of this stuff you'll be able to look

177
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,339
at two plants and go oh you and you I

178
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,839
should breed you two together because

179
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,939
you've got these traits and you've got

180
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,859
these traits and I see magic you'll

181
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,478
learn it you'll start to feel it I

182
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,160
understand a lot about music I

183
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,199
understand I can count time I can read

184
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,819
and write music I understand polyrhythms

185
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,400
compound time I can play with the band

186
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,620
very well I know a lot about music when

187
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,899
I get on stage I do not think about any

188
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,519
of my musical education I play with

189
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,439
Groove I play with funk I play with my

190
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,758
my heart I make sure that I'm matching

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,379
up with the bass player I'm making sure

192
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,300
that I'm using Dynamics when people are

193
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,279
singing I don't think about counting

194
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,840
time I know all of that stuff is in me

195
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,059
because I've got a solid education about

196
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,799
music when it comes time to perform my

197
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,199
intuition and my heart take over and I

198
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,060
can do it instinctually if you build a

199
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,919
solid education with these plants and a

200
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,418
solid education about breeding you'll be

201
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,799
able to grow and breed the same way

202
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,659
you'll just look at plants and you'll

203
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
know you'll feel it they'll tell you if

204
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,020
you listen the plants are already

205
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,418
telling you everything you need to know

206
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,038
so learn about those mental charts learn

207
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,019
about your co-dominant learn about your

208
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,120
dominant recessive traits learn about

209
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,339
how pollen works there's a lot of things

210
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,319
to read about pollen then once you

211
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,899
understand that stuff write down a goal

212
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,340
then just breed with love and grow from

213
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,159
your heart let's talk a little bit more

214
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,279
in depth about actually selecting a male

215
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,840
plant to pollinate these ladies with I

216
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,239
generally like to start with a male

217
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,098
plant that is way different than the

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,740
targeted female plants which I like to

219
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:37,139
pollinate so my example would be let's

220
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,120
just go with my main taking of a rise a

221
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,819
rise is a Golden Goat female plant

222
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,280
pollinated by a daybreaker male plant

223
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,560
that cross was such a huge success that

224
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,538
I chose a male from that to base much of

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
my sea lion on for the future that is my

226
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,560
King Solomon male he came from that

227
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,599
batch of seeds let's talk about why I

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,879
chose to breed those together

229
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,399
the Golden Goat is what we like to call

230
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,779
a sativa dominant looking plant I know

231
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,399
the terminology and the words are

232
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,679
changing every day in this industry but

233
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,659
we used to call that a sativa plant it's

234
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,579
got longer skinnier leaves when you

235
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,020
smoke it you get like a crazy head Buzz

236
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,120
that makes you kind of psychedelic and

237
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,698
freaked out a little bit it grows taller

238
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,160
it grows skinnier the daybreaker was the

239
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,900
complete opposite it put out giant wide

240
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,280
long droopy leaves you could build a

241
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,258
carport with these leaves you could

242
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,698
cover the entire house with just a

243
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,620
couple of these leaves and build a shade

244
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,840
canopy it also grew a little bit

245
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,280
stretchy kind of lanky the complete

246
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,318
opposite of the Golden Goat which would

247
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,360
get tall but it would keep tighter inner

248
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,158
node spaces and more uh more of a

249
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,599
compact structure where that daybreaker

250
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,519
would get a little lanky a little bit

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,560
stretchy have some more space in the

252
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,299
nodes more like that OG Kush sort of a

253
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,098
thing so when I bread them together

254
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,620
there was a lot of room in the middle

255
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,720
there for them to meet then I also could

256
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,179
see what the daybreaker male was doing

257
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
to the female so I like to use a male

258
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,539
plant that is way different from my

259
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,120
female plants that way I've got Opera

260
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,559
opportunity to make new [ __ ] one way to

261
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,019
describe it is if I'm trying to make new

262
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
stuff I wouldn't pour chocolate and more

263
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,919
chocolate in a bowl because guess what

264
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,838
I'm gonna get chocolate I'm gonna put

265
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,099
some chocolate maybe some banana in

266
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,899
there and get some chocolate banana

267
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,519
maybe put chocolate and strawberry in

268
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,320
the other and get some strawberry banana

269
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,820
chocolate do things like that get

270
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,920
creative so I want to do things that are

271
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,399
way different not two plants that are

272
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,139
super similar in genetic variety now

273
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,778
let's focus in on some of these specific

274
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,519
traits that I do look for in a male plan

275
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,338
things that are really important to me

276
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,860
are plant shape and size and structure

277
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,779
what is this plant shaped like keep this

278
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,940
in mind when you're picking a male plant

279
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:37,980
that is going to be 50 percent of the

280
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,019
outcome of your Offspring so do you want

281
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,360
these uh your seeds do you want them to

282
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,980
make tall skinny plants short squat

283
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,839
plants do you want short inner node

284
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,639
spacing do you want longer node spacing

285
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,380
do you want plants that Branch out real

286
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,240
far do you want plants that stay in kind

287
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,820
of skinny do you want them to grow real

288
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,799
tall or stay kind of squat you can kind

289
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,839
of set yourself up for this by selecting

290
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,338
a male plant that has these traits that

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
you are looking for this is when you

292
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,800
start making those decisions so plant

293
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,719
shape plant structure plant size plant

294
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,458
sturdiness are the branches of your meal

295
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,139
plan nice and sturdy or are they all

296
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,939
weak and wispy and shitty because if you

297
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,379
breed with that weak wispy shitty mail

298
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,200
guess what you're going to have the

299
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,299
opportunity for weak wispy shitty

300
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,580
Offspring so keep that in mind something

301
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,679
I think about is amount of branching

302
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,600
does it make a lot of lateral branching

303
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,458
does it keep going straight up how does

304
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,680
this plant Branch once the branches come

305
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,419
out do they make more branches do those

306
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,399
branches make a lot of shoots is that

307
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,079
the structure I'm looking for that is

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,240
something I keep in mind When selecting

309
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,820
a male plant I mentioned this a moment

310
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,620
ago internode spacing so you've got your

311
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,240
main stock coming up the middle of the

312
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,639
plant you got branches coming off of

313
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,440
there how far apart are those main

314
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,778
branches coming off the stock that is

315
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,519
internodal spacing sometimes they'll be

316
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,439
a half inch apart sometimes they'll be

317
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,000
four or five inches apart if you're

318
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,740
getting some older tropical [ __ ] maybe

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,179
some golden goat crosses they'll be

320
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,860
really close together the Jack the

321
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,199
Ripper stuff might be close together

322
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,459
some of the OG Kush crosses the

323
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
presidential Kush there's going to be

324
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,059
some space between there what do you

325
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,919
need if you're growing in a place with

326
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,119
high humidity you may want some more

327
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,740
space in there so you don't get big

328
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,778
chunky buds to get a lot of room for

329
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,399
humidity if you're in a tropical place

330
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:16,259
that might help you out if you're in a

331
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
colder drier area you might be able to

332
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,740
handle bigger nugs with more density

333
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,060
they're not going to get the humidity in

334
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,399
there it's all about what you're

335
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,379
breeding for what your goal is how much

336
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,480
inner node spacing do you want also

337
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,220
flower clusters are very important when

338
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,500
it comes to selecting a male plant look

339
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,820
at that big flower cluster to get one

340
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,740
big top do you get a bunch of flowers

341
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,720
everywhere that's going to show you what

342
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,180
your meal plan what your Offspring is

343
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
going to do let's talk about Leaf shape

344
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,319
Leaf shape is a big indicator of things

345
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,179
in my opinion Leaf shape is kind of how

346
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,459
I decide how long a plant is going to

347
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,500
take to flower for the first time that I

348
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,119
run it if it's got big wide broad leaves

349
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,159
you know it's not going to take you more

350
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,019
than 70 days most of the time if it's

351
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,778
got those long skinny tropic leaves

352
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,759
that's probably a 70 77 day maybe even

353
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,578
more on the flowering side of the plant

354
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,078
scale so leave shape what size of leaves

355
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:05,939
are you looking for do you like those

356
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,859
long skinny leaves do you like big fat

357
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,120
leaves what kind of product are you

358
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,278
looking for this is going to play

359
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,440
heavily this Leaf shape and size is

360
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,259
going to transfer into your Offspring

361
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,940
then what about amount of leaves I don't

362
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,799
like too many leaves on my plants I

363
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,480
don't want to trim all day every day but

364
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,819
I need enough leaves for production and

365
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,800
photosynthesis so amount of leaves if

366
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,720
that male plant is just banging out tons

367
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,659
of tons of leaf and not a lot of bud

368
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,399
structure not a lot of flour cluster not

369
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,740
building strong stems and not being even

370
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,539
with its energy distribution I may not

371
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,579
choose that male plant to go into my

372
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,379
garden if it's super duper leafy I don't

373
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,120
want to spend a bunch of energy on

374
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,220
leaves and trimming a bunch of leaves in

375
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,139
my flour product let's talk about

376
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,480
something super important flower time

377
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,519
how long did it take for that male plant

378
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,740
to start giving you submit sufficient

379
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,240
amounts of pollen how long does it take

380
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,459
for that male plant to flower out and

381
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,740
make make a big giant fat male cluster

382
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,239
let your male plants go I let mine go

383
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,100
for like eight or nine weeks maybe 10

384
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,259
weeks the first time I run them to see

385
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,759
what they're going to give me so keep an

386
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,799
eye on that flowering time how long

387
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,480
until they started giving you pollen how

388
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,458
long does that male plant continue to

389
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,560
give you pollen then how big did that

390
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,479
main top get how big do those side buds

391
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,879
get pay attention to the flowering time

392
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,860
and how long it does continue to flower

393
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,600
also while it's flowering pay attention

394
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,700
to how tall it gets does it have a big

395
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,740
stretch time did it do anything crazy

396
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,839
during that flowering phase note that

397
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,940
because that is going to correlate to

398
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
your Offspring now here's when we get

399
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,160
into some of the fun more obvious parts

400
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,739
are there any colors flavors Aromas or

401
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,480
visual appearances or other senses that

402
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,419
you can use to detect obvious things

403
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,039
does it smell good does it smell bad I

404
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,719
like a male plant this is a weird thing

405
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,578
that I'm gonna share with you a weird

406
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,440
piece of advice I like a male plant that

407
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,419
if I give it a stem rub if it kind of

408
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,639
smells like vomit or bar trash can

409
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,338
that's a keeper that plant is going to

410
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,500
be very good for breeding in my opinion

411
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,220
I really do like that so look for things

412
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,379
like colors Aromas flavors most people

413
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,879
don't smoke the males there is one old

414
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,159
school breeder out there who will shake

415
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,480
the pollen off dry them and smoke them I

416
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,100
don't do that if you want to do that

417
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,240
that is up to you you're a better man

418
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
than me

419
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,039
another thing we definitely need to pay

420
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,680
attention to is problems and resistance

421
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
to problems in the grow how does this

422
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,778
male plant react to overfeeding how does

423
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,459
it react to underfeeding If These plants

424
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,200
are little [ __ ] guess what you're

425
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,179
going to breed little [ __ ] plants we

426
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,220
want plants that can handle a little bit

427
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,138
of abuse we're going to put these plants

428
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,480
in Grow rooms where things may go wrong

429
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,980
so we don't want a hundred percent [ __ ]

430
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
plants we need some kind of robust

431
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,300
resistant plants so how do they handle

432
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,459
handle over feed how do they handle

433
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,198
under feed how do they handle over or

434
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,119
underwater can they take a little bit of

435
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,059
a drought can they get drowned a little

436
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,740
bit I make seeds for commercial uh for

437
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,018
commercial production and for retail

438
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,940
sales so if those seeds can't take some

439
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,919
abuse some of my retail customers May

440
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,899
murder the seeds and I wouldn't have a

441
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,759
good successful company so I've got to

442
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,958
breed with things that can take a little

443
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,240
bit of abuse how about resistance to

444
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,799
pathogens did you get any powdery mildew

445
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,720
in that grow did you have any bud rot

446
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,939
how did those male plants deal with with

447
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,620
that how about bugs did you get any

448
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,839
spider mites in there did you get thrips

449
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,240
or fungus gnats did those bugs go

450
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,980
towards your male plant if those bugs

451
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,139
and pathogens did Go Near That male

452
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,579
plant how did that plant take it we want

453
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,860
to breed with plants that can handle

454
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:31,500
problems very well because like I keep

455
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,600
saying that is going to pass into your

456
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,159
Offspring all right we've talked about

457
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
the traits I'm looking for now let's

458
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,179
talk more specifically about how to find

459
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,579
these male plants which we are looking

460
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:44,278
for for breeding of course the starting

461
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:46,078
point is to pop some seeds however many

462
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,179
seeds you've got however many you can

463
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,739
run I don't know the legalities in your

464
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,138
area I don't know how much space you've

465
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,778
got but grow as many seeds as you can as

466
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,879
my recommendation I like to run at least

467
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,919
one maybe two or three packs of seeds to

468
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,720
find a male plant if you've only got one

469
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,519
you will find a keeper in there I always

470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,860
say that you will find a keeper in every

471
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,440
10 pack of my seeds which means you will

472
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,300
also find a good meal in there but of

473
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,980
course the more numbers you've got the

474
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,078
merrier the more opportunity to find

475
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,300
that outlier that amazing stud mail

476
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,698
that's how I found King Solomon anyway

477
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,278
step one is to get some seeds and

478
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:22,679
germinate them get them growing then

479
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,360
identify the males and the females

480
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,979
obviously is going to be our next step

481
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,778
if you want to run the females in

482
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,100
another room do that that's a whole

483
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,320
other conversation that's another

484
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,540
podcast in this episode we're going to

485
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,579
focus on the boys so we've germinated

486
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,799
some seeds we've identified the boys and

487
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,239
girls we're gonna move the boys to

488
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,698
another room and that's what we're going

489
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,620
to focus on for now before we get too

490
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,419
far let me recommend that if you do want

491
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,299
to repeat this process I recommend

492
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,578
getting clones from these plants as soon

493
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,219
as you can and before we go into flower

494
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,679
it is a little bit more challenging to

495
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,980
re-vege a male plant than it is a female

496
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,899
plant in my opinion in my experience it

497
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,060
is harder to re-vege the boys than it is

498
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,338
the girls so I would recommend you get

499
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,678
clones before we do go into flower with

500
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:09,359
these male plants so at this point we

501
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,100
have separated our males and females

502
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,500
we've gotten clones now we're going to

503
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,480
put these plants into flower

504
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,880
when it comes to selecting a male plant

505
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,880
I generally do not choose the male plant

506
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,860
that shows flour very first as a

507
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,780
breeding candidate sometimes so let's

508
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,578
say let me start with 10 seeds let's say

509
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,558
I started with 10 seeds a lot of you are

510
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,359
going to start with 10. we'll germinate

511
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,940
10 seeds out of those 10 we're going to

512
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,439
find probably five males five females

513
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,259
that's usually the way nature Works

514
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,480
about 50 50 sometimes you're going to

515
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,859
see 60 40. let's work with what we get

516
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,419
we're going to pull the females aside

517
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,839
let's say at this point we've got

518
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,460
approximately five male seedlings to

519
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,899
work with here I'm gonna put them into

520
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,279
if I'm gonna get clones like I mentioned

521
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,140
then I'm going to put them into flour

522
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,720
once they're into flour they're going to

523
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,299
begin to show me the sex from those five

524
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,759
I will not choose the first or probably

525
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:02,400
even the second plant to show me that it

526
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,319
is a male for my breeding male the

527
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,500
reason behind this is I find that that

528
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,558
male is probably usually most commonly

529
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,000
going to dominate my crosses of

530
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,339
everything that I make so what I'm

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,380
saying is let's just say that that meal

532
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,240
is chocolate like I used earlier I use

533
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,460
chocolate as an example if I use that

534
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,740
chocolate everything I pollinate with

535
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,720
that chocolate is going to be dominantly

536
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,839
chocolate even if I cross it too like I

537
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,940
said earlier strawberries bananas uh

538
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,519
whatever else I cross it to it's going

539
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,320
to kind of be more chocolate with a

540
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,599
little bananas more chocolate with a

541
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,220
little strawberries so I choose not to

542
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,659
use those first couple of males that

543
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,160
show me that they're male because

544
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,019
they're just going to dominate The Cross

545
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,400
it's going to be too much of them I

546
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,619
don't want to just make copies of this

547
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,900
male plant I want to make 50 50 crosses

548
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,298
or somewhere near there and that's not

549
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,519
going to do it so usually the first one

550
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,379
or two plants that show me their males

551
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,019
are not the candidates which I choose

552
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,940
for breeding it's also usually not the

553
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,099
last one it's usually the third or

554
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,960
fourth male to show me that it is male

555
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:07,619
that I choose for the breeding project

556
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,120
here's a hint also early in flower most

557
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,319
of the plants that are male are going to

558
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,359
show you their boys because they'll

559
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,159
stretch up above everybody else they'll

560
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,079
be the taller plants those males try to

561
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,940
get taller so they could drop the pollen

562
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,500
down on the ladies which are down below

563
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,298
them so pay attention to that that may

564
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,038
give you a little bit of heads up

565
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:24,359
something to look for all right so I

566
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,038
don't choose that first guy to start

567
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,779
showing pollen to start shooting his

568
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,819
load probably not the second guy it's

569
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,379
usually the third or the fourth plant

570
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,639
that starts making pollen and my reason

571
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,700
is because I don't want that super

572
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,559
dominant male that early flower with all

573
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,419
that testosterone all that male stuff

574
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,579
going on I don't need that going into

575
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,500
the cross so I generally choose that

576
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,240
third or fourth male it's usually not

577
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,679
the fifth one out of a pack of ten it's

578
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,599
usually not the fifth it's honestly

579
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,919
generally the third or fourth I'll

580
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,379
choose the one with the shape the

581
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,940
structure uh the pollen time the one

582
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,559
that is closest to the traits I'm

583
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,720
looking for between number three and

584
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,279
four that'll be the one that I choose so

585
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,079
let's say we've made our selection

586
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,399
you've got to choose now this is where

587
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,960
it comes time for you to make that

588
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,298
decision this is the plan you're going

589
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,579
to choose for your braiding project use

590
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,679
your education use my advice use your

591
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,538
intuition and choose that male plant

592
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,980
that looks the best the only thing

593
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,179
that's going to go wrong if you choose

594
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,620
the wrong one is you're gonna have to go

595
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,360
back and breathe again it's not a huge

596
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,519
mistake it's not a huge problem it's fun

597
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,899
we get to do it again if especially if

598
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,119
it's your first time you get to see what

599
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,038
you made if it's awesome [ __ ] awesome

600
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,599
if it's not awesome it's still going to

601
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,919
be great it just may not be [ __ ]

602
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,659
amazing you made a bunch of seeds you

603
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,038
get to grow and have fun with and you

604
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,259
learned a lot then you get to go and do

605
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,879
it again but now the pressure's on now

606
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,859
it is time for you to select that male

607
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,799
plant do you want number three do you

608
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,418
want number four make your decision now

609
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,220
it's time for the fun part now we put

610
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,259
the plants in the room we time it

611
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,179
perfectly so that those plants can give

612
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,940
and receive pollen and then we can make

613
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,440
seeds it's easy to time up those plants

614
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,298
the first time you put the mail you put

615
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,880
the female in the room on the same day

616
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:58,379
you put them into flour and you watch a

617
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,240
lot of times I'll put the mail in the

618
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,100
flower room a little bit before the

619
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,298
females sometimes I'll stagger the

620
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,399
females into the rooms at different

621
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,500
times you will have to figure out when

622
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,019
your male plant produces the most pollen

623
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,640
and when your female plants are ready to

624
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,500
receive that pollen when those pistols

625
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,840
are big and ripe looking like dandelions

626
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,160
that's when they want the pollen so the

627
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,839
first time you do the cross you can just

628
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,058
put them in there at the same time it

629
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,319
will work then pay attention when does

630
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,418
the pollen happen when does pink

631
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,819
ripeness happen then you can adjust your

632
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,259
schedule accordingly for future runs the

633
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,720
first run you'll get plenty of seeds

634
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,460
doing it just the natural way so get

635
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,798
your mail plant get your selected female

636
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,659
plants put them in the room and let the

637
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,759
pollen happen some people will put that

638
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,980
male plant in front of a fan let that

639
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,419
fan blow it around honestly that male

640
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,679
plant is going to pop open those flowers

641
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,900
and the pollen is going to go moving

642
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,640
around naturally I've also seen people

643
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,860
cut the top off and just shake that top

644
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,720
around and pollinate everything however

645
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,639
you choose to do it get that pollen all

646
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,779
throughout that room pollinate those

647
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,520
females

648
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,279
then it's really important to let those

649
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,859
seeds finish you can run my suggested

650
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,079
light cycle of 18 on and six hours off

651
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,359
or you can do 12 12 that is up to you

652
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,099
both of those will work the most

653
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,139
important part is let the seeds finish

654
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,639
then carefully Harvest those seeds get

655
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,100
them out of your plants that is a whole

656
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,259
other podcast episode I think I've done

657
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,538
that episode before now here comes the

658
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,579
fun part we get to grow out these seeds

659
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,319
before we grow these let's talk a little

660
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:24,480
bit about why I like to pollinate

661
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,359
multiple female plants with one male

662
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,339
plant and a breeding run the reason I do

663
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,439
this is because now I can see what that

664
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,538
male plant has contributed to the

665
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,360
breeding project to multiple different

666
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:38,099
females so if I did let's just go back

667
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,139
to my old chocolate analogy let's say

668
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,240
I've read chocolate to Banana I bread

669
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,799
chocolate to strawberry and just for fun

670
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,740
we'll say that I've read chocolate to

671
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,359
key lime now if I just bread it to one I

672
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,159
could get an idea of what is happening

673
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,558
in my project I could say this one came

674
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,120
out a lot of the chocolate traits and

675
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,879
some of the strawberry treats maybe it's

676
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,399
got the Leaf shape of the chocolate and

677
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,679
the tallness of the strawberry and 50 50

678
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,659
chocolate and strawberry Flavor now I

679
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,580
only have an idea of what the chocolate

680
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,140
plant is passing it's passing that leaf

681
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,178
structure or whatever I attributed to

682
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,159
the chocolate I know it's doing that but

683
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,559
is that an anomaly is that what's going

684
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,960
to happen commonly is that just one time

685
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,298
is that a recessive or a dominant trait

686
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,700
so what I want to do is check with other

687
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:22,679
female plants and see what traits so I

688
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,080
did uh strawberry right I said banana

689
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,120
when I did the chocolate to Banana what

690
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,439
was common with that strawberry cross

691
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,599
when I grew up the seeds from the

692
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,640
strawberry and the banana cross what do

693
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,439
I see which is common do I see things

694
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,940
coming from the male plant like Leaf

695
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,640
shape are there commonalities in the

696
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,440
leaf shape commonalities in structure

697
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
I know what the female plants look like

698
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,759
when we flower them now I need to take

699
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,259
those traits identify the trait that

700
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,058
came from the female identified the

701
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,460
trait that came from the male and learn

702
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,619
what that male is passing it's easier to

703
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,659
do if I pollinate multiple females so

704
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,399
now I put it to Strawberry put it to

705
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,440
Banana let's see what happens when I

706
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,298
crossed it to the key lime pie how much

707
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,919
of the key lime am I tasting am I seeing

708
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:03,538
that big leaf shape am I seeing the

709
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,580
skinny leaves where are the

710
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:08,819
commonalities if in all of those crosses

711
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:10,319
I get like this weird diesel fuel Aroma

712
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,058
that I didn't know about that's probably

713
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,859
coming from the chocolate if they all

714
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,599
have different flavors that's coming

715
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,178
from the mother plant probably that

716
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,158
flavor trait didn't get past so that's

717
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,259
how we learn what the male plant is

718
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,419
going to do in our crosses is by hitting

719
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,460
multiple females with it growing out

720
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,440
those seeds taking notes and observing

721
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,120
traits and then attributing oh those

722
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,038
traits go to the male plant those traits

723
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,259
go to the female plants and then find

724
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,000
the commonalities in those traits and

725
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,220
that's probably what the male plant is

726
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,480
delivering to that mix now here's

727
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,980
something that's really going to throw

728
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,599
you off you're going to see [ __ ] that

729
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,400
isn't in the male plant or the female

730
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,859
plan those are going to be traits that

731
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,600
came from the grandparents so maybe that

732
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,219
male plant didn't show you that it had

733
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,379
something going on in it maybe it didn't

734
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,000
show you that it'll put out red leaves

735
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,919
at week seven maybe you didn't know that

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,419
maybe that came from the purple Thai

737
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,940
plant that it was his mom or something

738
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,620
so the mom of the male plant put out red

739
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,058
plant two weeks or red leaves at week

740
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,099
seven we didn't know that we didn't see

741
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:06,839
that in the male plant but now it popped

742
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,158
up in The Offspring so that was a

743
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,959
recessive trait that we didn't find

744
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,159
until we bred they came from a

745
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,558
grandparent you're going to see things

746
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,840
like that in your breeding projects so I

747
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,579
like to know if I'm using plant a and

748
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,459
plant B I like to know the parents of

749
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,139
plant a and plant B uh and even further

750
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,700
sometimes I like to know their parents

751
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,860
so you're doing like four and then two

752
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,019
and then one on the family tree I like

753
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,599
to know that much info uh that'll help

754
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,759
me identify recessive traits dominant

755
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,859
co-dominant traits helps me a little bit

756
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,619
with my predictions in my mental charts

757
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:40,259
uh just helps me to know and then also

758
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,178
helps me not do do too much in breeding

759
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:43,740
and double crossing over Crossing back

760
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,720
Crossing on accident which I do on

761
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,700
purpose sometimes but I don't want to do

762
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,740
it too much on accident because like I

763
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,480
said before I have the best success when

764
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,538
things are more different if you cross

765
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,620
OG to OG you just get [ __ ] OG if you

766
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:57,240
cross

767
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:58,079
um not OG let's see something way

768
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,120
different I'm just going to say

769
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,619
strawberries to lemons you could really

770
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,000
tell you get strawberry lemons you could

771
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:05,038
tell those different flavors together if

772
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,839
you put gas and Candy together you could

773
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,759
tell candy gas if you put gas and gas

774
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,199
together we can just make more gas it's

775
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,960
hard to tell what you're making all

776
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,298
right let me keep going here because I

777
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,980
do want to touch on how that is

778
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,900
basically how I select a male plant for

779
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,700
breeding it's got to have specific

780
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,980
traits which I am looking for for the

781
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,659
breeding project it's got to have the

782
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,960
leaf shape the leaf size structure

783
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,580
flavor Aroma bug resistance pathogen

784
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,079
resistance it's got to have all of that

785
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,359
stuff it's got to make the right amount

786
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,119
of pollen at the right time uh probably

787
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,278
not the first or second male to show me

788
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,918
that it is the mail in the bunch and

789
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,079
then the only way to verify that is to

790
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,059
pollinate pollinate multiple plants then

791
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,619
grow those seeds out see what you have

792
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:48,418
created look for those traits that come

793
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,278
from the male plant like I've said then

794
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,538
attribute those to the male plant and

795
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:53,759
then that's how you know what that male

796
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,980
plant is contributing to your breeding

797
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,099
project that's how I select a male that

798
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,679
is exactly how I do it there's no magic

799
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,480
or no Voodoo I use uh intention and I

800
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,100
have a goal and I use my intuition and

801
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,380
my education to find a male that I think

802
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,480
will reach my goal again the most

803
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,059
important part is a goal now I do want

804
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,339
to touch on how I select a female plant

805
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:18,178
that I do want to reverse to create

806
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:20,339
pollen to use for a feminized seed run

807
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,919
it's very similar to the way that I

808
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,959
select a male plant for breeding the

809
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,900
plant has to be what I call a perfect

810
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,538
tan I don't know in your criteria what

811
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,140
plant is a perfect tan it's got to have

812
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,579
flavor Aroma Buzz the right effects if

813
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,380
it's a medicinal effect or a

814
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,658
recreational effect it's got to have the

815
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,340
effects I'm after it's got to have the

816
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,620
right height the right shape the right

817
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,058
structure the right flowering time then

818
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:46,079
some of the more important stuff that we

819
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,538
overlook

820
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,000
it's got to have pest resistance I don't

821
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,319
need to plant it waves hey hey to spider

822
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,119
mites I need a plant that goes hey

823
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,619
spider mites [ __ ] off there's some

824
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,778
plants the spider mites won't even go

825
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,000
near I like those plants breed with

826
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:02,278
those bad [ __ ] I like plants that are

827
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,079
mold resistant I've been sending seeds

828
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,419
and plants all over the country lately

829
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,278
and I'm starting to learn very well what

830
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,080
plants do work well in certain parts of

831
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:11,819
our country so plants that are mold

832
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,980
resistant are very sought after for

833
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:16,259
breeding descending those seeds to the

834
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,360
each coast of the north east coast the

835
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,700
northwest coast both of them need very

836
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,859
mold resistant plants so find something

837
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,140
that is mold resistant if it's powdery

838
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,178
mildew if it's Bud rot any of the molds

839
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,679
out there find a plant that does not get

840
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,778
that [ __ ] when you put it in that

841
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,820
environment find plants that are drought

842
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:34,500
resistant find plants that can be over

843
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:36,359
water a plant that can be drowned a

844
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,640
little bit plants that can take abuse

845
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,339
and stress plants it can take popping

846
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,900
twisting lollipopping defoliating it

847
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,699
needs to be able to take all of the [ __ ]

848
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,620
that I'm gonna throw at it when it comes

849
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,600
to reversing a plant I needed to be a

850
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,038
perfect 10 and I needed to have all the

851
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,500
traits that I'm looking for in a male

852
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,379
plant and even more it's got to be even

853
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,480
better than a meal plan because the

854
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,159
females I can grow them I can smoke them

855
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,620
I can turn them into concentrates I can

856
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,480
smoke them as flowers I can see what I'm

857
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,678
working with so I already know what

858
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,380
they're going to look like in the female

859
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,659
form so they have got to be super

860
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,820
Stellar let's talk about some examples

861
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,340
super Stellar plants that were tens

862
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:16,019
Golden Goat that's why I chose to

863
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:18,658
reverse Golden Goat that plant is a

864
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,418
perfect 10. it grows well it's got a

865
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,980
Killer Buzz it tastes amazing and if you

866
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,200
get a if you get it going strong and you

867
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,659
take care of it that plant thrives you

868
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,038
almost can't mess it up you could pee in

869
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,778
it you could kick it over you can over

870
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,038
feed it under feed it you could give it

871
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:33,839
a drought you could give it too much

872
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:35,700
water you can overheat it you can freeze

873
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,980
it golden goats Just Gonna Keep on

874
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,558
growing and produce badass flowers for

875
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,019
you so Golden Goat is a perfect 10 in my

876
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,700
opinion another one that I found to be a

877
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,500
perfect 10 and somebody else agreed with

878
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,960
me I've talked about why I reversed this

879
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,119
one the blueberry cookies that made the

880
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,700
turtle line was a perfect is a perfect

881
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,619
tan that plant tastes good it grows well

882
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,679
it's got a Killer Buzz to it it doesn't

883
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,778
get problems it grows with huge vigor

884
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,000
like I said before you could piss in it

885
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,619
and it will still keep on growing so

886
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,200
that's why I chose the blueberry cookies

887
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,000
and my third example of the Grateful Dog

888
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,819
The Grateful Dog is a perfect [ __ ]

889
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,099
tin that flavor the aroma the colors

890
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,859
that plant is a perfect 10. that's why I

891
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,019
chose those plants as reversals so use

892
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:21,240
those as your standard The Grateful Dog

893
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,740
the blueberry cookies and Golden Goat

894
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,419
those are the kind of plants I would

895
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,980
choose to reverse so when you're looking

896
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,538
for standards looking for a metric

897
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,819
looking for something to compare it to

898
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,740
those are the ladies that I would choose

899
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,119
that I did choose to reverse so those

900
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,620
are three of my favorite plants that

901
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,599
I've ever worked with those are my three

902
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,038
favorite reversals there are more coming

903
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,500
I am working on some things I haven't

904
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,298
shared with you yet but so far the

905
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,159
Golden Goat the blueberry cookies and

906
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,440
the Grateful Dog have been my three

907
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
favorite plants to reverse all right I
