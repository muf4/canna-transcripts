pet peeve my brother uh taste Trends

100
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,840
fruity is the trend gas is the trend and

101
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,079
sour is all the trend and then he says

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
all I want is great flour and great

103
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,079
genetics I hate all of these flavor

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Trends I understand what you're talking

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,959
about however I may disagree we will

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
delve more into that as this message

107
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,879
unfolds it says I hate the trends I

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
don't give a fruit no he says a

109
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,360
different word but I'm going to say

110
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,159
fruit because we're early in the episode

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,360
we don't want to get censored that says

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,400
I don't give a fruit if it's fruity piny

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,560
pissy gassy spicy or Woody as long as

114
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,719
it's killer product I I want specific

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,918
buzzes that's what I hunt for now that's

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,960
where we're going to kind of delve into

117
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,599
this in a minute if the buzz I'm looking

118
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,319
for comes in Pine well then it's going

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
to be Pine I love the great flavors like

120
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,560
the rest but if I can find no ceiling

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,560
shoot you to the Moon weed I don't give

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,079
a crap if it's trendy strain if it's a

123
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,879
trendy strain or not back in the day you

124
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,279
didn't know what you were going to get

125
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,038
and that was another part of the

126
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,319
excitement yes that was a I remember

127
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,959
those days when you didn't know what you

128
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,599
were going to get you just went to the

129
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,038
dude's house you got what the dude had

130
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,479
he paid him money you were excited just

131
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:13,560
to have something to smoke but this is a

132
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,839
whole new era of cannabis a lot of this

133
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,399
is uh medical cannabis people are SPO

134
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,000
smoking and consuming cannabis for uh

135
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,599
medical needs and they they need

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
specific things so a lot of that does

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,919
matter we're going to talk about that uh

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,240
as this like I said as this does unfold

139
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,719
um and I do agree just getting what you

140
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,759
used to get was part of the excitement

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,680
but now part of the excit for me is

142
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,479
going to uh sometimes it's my friend's

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,478
house sometimes it's the dgc cup I don't

144
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,318
really buy flowers from dispensaries but

145
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,680
I will stop in for concentrates CU I

146
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,360
can't make the concentrates that I buy

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,000
uh I can't keep up with Green Dot to be

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
quite honest with you uh but that

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,240
variety that's on the Shelf at the

150
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,198
dispensary that Green Dot when I go see

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,879
all those different jars and I've got

152
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,439
that variety and I know they're all very

153
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,879
good and very consumable that puts a

154
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,399
smile on my face when I go to the dgc

155
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,279
cup and I see that Hot Rod's got his

156
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,439
flower on the table Hobbit's got his

157
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,719
flower on the table turps has fiz flour

158
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,600
on the table soda's got his amazing

159
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,360
lemon Jeffrey on the table and I can

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,000
look at all of those all that variety

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
puts a smile on my face I love it we're

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,079
in a whole new era of cannabis I don't

163
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,439
have to just take what the dude's got if

164
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,959
it tastes like uh cat piss and I'm not

165
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,639
in a catpiss I can smoke the other one

166
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,879
that tastes like strawberries which

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,879
we're going to talk more about all this

168
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,918
let me finish your message it says

169
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,719
enough of my rant brother Jeff oh no

170
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,038

171
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,720

177
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,239

178
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,240
hard work is paying off so you've got

179
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,199
some killer smoke which is what we crave

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,759
brondo bro it's what plants crave now

181
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,319
there are a lot of things to unpack in

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,120
here as I've mentioned a couple of times

183
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,080
in this um you start by saying you want

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,879
specific buzzes and that's what you hunt

185
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,198
for you don't care if it comes in Pine

186
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,879
uh then you didn't list other flavors

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
but I understand what you're saying but

188
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,439
what I have found through my research

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,280
through my experience I think uh through

190
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,680
Reading and through science as well they

191
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:24,000
could probably back me up a lot of those

192
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,680
buzzes come along with a very specific

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,598
flavor those are the turpins that are

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,079
providing the flavor and also

195
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,878
contributing to your Buzz so here is the

196
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
analogy that I'm going to use to explain

197
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,120
this keep in mind I have no degree I do

198
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,598
not have any um education on this this

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
is what I have figured out through

200
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,439
reading through studying through my own

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,158
experience this is what I come up with

202
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,079
the THC or the chosen cannabinoid in the

203
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:48,439
product which you are smoking is what

204
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,758
makes you go high let's compare that to

205
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,120
a firework let's just say if you pack

206
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,000
this firework with THC the more THC you

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,519
put in there the higher into the sky

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,519
that firework is going to go right that

209
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,680
is your rocket fuel your your gunpowder

210
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,918
we'll say you're going to stuff that

211
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,158
into this firework we're going to light

212
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,680
it it's going to take off if you got 50%

213
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:09,000
THC we're getting 50% up there if you

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,038
got 89% THC we're going 89% way up in

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,959
the sky that's the THC now I really

216
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,639
think strongly the tpin are and there

217
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,758
are other con other parts other

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
components to this that do can play into

219
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,720
this uh equation here but we're going to

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,360
start with the tpin there are Esters

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,759
pades flavonoids other things in this

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
same category but we're going to focus

223
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,639
on turps just to keep it specific um the

224
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,519
T tpin when this firework goes up in the

225
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,639
sky that's you getting high but the tpin

226
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,959
in my experience in my opinion in my

227
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,479
theory those are what give you uh the

228
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,199
color to the firework those are the

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,038
different colors in that firework what

230
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,399
do we pack in there what and those are

231
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:46,360
different chemicals and fireworks that

232
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,080
do it but they're going to be different

233
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,600
TPS in cannabis those tping are what

234
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,879
affect my high in different ways I'm

235
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,440
going to get high from the THC but now

236
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,919
am I going to get paranoid am I going to

237
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,200
get the giggles am I going to get the

238
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,479
munchies am I going to get confused am I

239
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,440
going to get tunnel vision am I going to

240
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,959
I get horny am I going to get a headache

241
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
is my headache going to go away is my

242
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,958
blood pressure blood pressure going to

243
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,838
raise or is my blood pressure going to

244
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,599
drop there are several different things

245
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,200
I can get from different cannabis plants

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,159
I think most of that is from the turpins

247
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,278
a lot of it is from the turps so you

248
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,199
said I don't care about specific flavors

249
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,278
but I bet if you started paying

250
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,440
attention from this point forward you'll

251
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,679
notice that certain flavors and Aromas

252
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,240
give you different buzzes So when you

253
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,000
say that I don't give a I understand you

254
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,799
don't care what the trend is but it does

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
really matter what the flavors and

256
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,599
Aromas are uh I did an episode long long

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,919
ago that is called follow your nose it

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,399
may be before I was even doing video

259
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,799
podcast but it was called follow your

260
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,799
nose because I believe that your nose

261
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,439
knows when you go uh wherever you're

262
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,159
going to buy your cannabis if it's to

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,480
your own uh plethora of jars or to a

264
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,319
dispensary or to your buddy um if you go

265
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,079
to that dispensary and you open 10 jars

266
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,959
five of them you're going to go nah not

267
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,958
it not it if you're an experienced if

268
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,039
you're not just excited about it they do

269
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,879
all smell good but out of those 10 jars

270
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,360
maybe there's two of them that really

271
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,439
jump out to you and maybe there's

272
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,680
something to do with the way those tpin

273
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,440
are talking to your body now this is

274
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,239
another analogy I'll compare all of this

275
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,200
too this is why poop is brown and stinks

276
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,919
and why oranges are bright orange and

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,959
taste good and are good for you the poop

278
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,519
stinks uh because we're not supposed to

279
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,479
eat it that's Nature's little hint of

280
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,919
saying hey bro don't eat that like don't

281
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,120
do it bro unless you're a gross dog or

282
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,399
something most people aren't going to

283
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,278
want want to eat a poop unless there's

284
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,240
something deeply wrong with you on the

285
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,559
other hand oranges are bright orange

286
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
they get your eye you look if you're in

287
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,679
nature and you're walking around you see

288
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
an orange go oh that looks good just

289
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,838
something inside of your brain can taste

290
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
it you start getting the juicy flavor in

291
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,720
your mouth you want to climb over there

292
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,719
and get that orange and eat it and the

293
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,959
orange tastes good and looks appealing

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,278
visually for a reason nature gave us

295
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,359
those signals on purpose I really think

296
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,919
that the turpins and our flowers and our

297
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
ganja and our cannabis and our

298
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:59,639
concentrates uh they're that way for a

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,159
reason it draws us um maybe you don't

300
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,759
even know there was a reason why you

301
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,278
needed uh that lemon Jeffrey today maybe

302
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,480
that's the one you smoked and it fixed

303
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,399
so many things you weren't even aware of

304
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,720
uh internally or biologically that you

305
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,000
weren't even thinking about or maybe it

306
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,200
has put you in the mood that you needed

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,919
to be in uh cuz it's the turpine for you

308
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,440
maybe it works perfectly for you so I do

309
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,360
bet that if you did some studying some

310
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,639
paying attention you would notice that

311
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,639
certain buzzes come from certain turps I

312
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,278
notice uh most of the time lemony stuff

313
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,399
puts a good smile on my face lemon

314
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,360
Jeffrey Lemon Diesel lemon skunk it's

315
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,958
all got a good Smiley uplifting like hey

316
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,839
what's up bro kind of a buzz um all of

317
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,559
the GMO Han Solo Burger uh that stuff

318
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,160
the uh what's it called The Garlic

319
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,919
Banger from Green Dot that puts me like

320
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,240
heavy that's like narcotic it makes me

321
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:51,759
want to chill it just pushes me down all

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,240
of that stuff has a um a garlicky nasty

323
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,799
uh trash can fermented sort of a turp to

324
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,680
it uh sort of a heavier uh the opposite

325
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,240
end of the lemons and they have opposite

326
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,120
completely opposite buzzes so I I can

327
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,039
notice that in the buzz when I smoke

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,759
those different products let me pay more

329
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,838
attention to my notes cuz I've got a a

330
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,639
lot of notes Here I was actually on a

331
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,200
podcast with other breeders shout out to

332
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
my friends at the dude grow show I was

333
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,320
on the dude grow show I was on a

334
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,879
breeders panel and we had several

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,760
breeders talking about uh what we like

336
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,000
and what the market likes and to be

337
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,759
honest with you flavors and Aroma were

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,120
always in breeders top three any breeder

339
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,439
we went through the panel and like what

340
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,039
matters most to you and flavor and aroma

341
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,720
uh and the smokable product is

342
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,240
definitely in the top three for every

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,000
breeder on the panel that made a big

344
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,680
difference uh what else do I have oh I

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,639
wrote down that these Trends this is

346
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,719
where I do agree with this pet peeve

347
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,839
here I completely agree with this part

348
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,560
it drives me crazy this is one of my old

349
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399
man pet peeves I'll jump in with you now

350
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,439
I'll get on your lawn with you um this

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,480
one when people say I got that gas if

352
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,880
you tell me you got gas right and I show

353
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,399
up and your weed smells like blueberries

354
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,320
I don't want it I want it gas if you say

355
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,879
I got that gas that's because your weed

356
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,120
smells like gas that's why you call it

357
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,919
gas that's why people have just taken

358
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,799
the word gas and applied it to any weed

359
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,759
now and that ain't real that's false

360
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,919
advertising that's like walking around

361
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,679
with uh Whoppers in your pocket talking

362
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,559
about you got Big Macs no you don't you

363
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,359
got some good cheeseburgers but you

364
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,078
definitely don't have Big Macs my dude

365
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,360
that wasn't your way right away all

366
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,879
right so that's my part of this pet

367
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,278
peeve if you call it gas that [ __ ]

368
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,039
better be gassy if you say I got the

369
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:31,600
fruit and it smells fruity I'm happy

370
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,679
with that but if you call it gas and it

371
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,759
smells like [ __ ] blueberries or

372
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,879
cookies or that's not gas my dude stop

373
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,759
doing that you guys all right let me

374
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,159
regroup make sure I answered your

375
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,159
question um the turps will predict the

376
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,879
buzz I think you'll find that I do agree

377
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,319
that the trends are silly but I bet you

378
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,958
that if you pay attention some of those

379
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
Trends will lead you in a direction um

380
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,599
the nose always knows follow your nose

381
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,278
because I think your nose knows what TPS

382
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,320
your body needs uh all turps matter and

383
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,278
if you're going to call it the gas show

384
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,079

446
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,000
it it says I've got some general

447
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,000
questions regarding land races when it

448
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,519
comes to breeding this is a great

449
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,440
question I'm going to enjoy this but

450
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,318
before I answer it let me give a little

451
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,480
bit of a disclaimer I am not much of a

452
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,879
land race grower or breeder uh the land

453
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
race Growers and breeders are kind of a

454
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,278
special Niche group when it comes to the

455
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,318
Cannabis World there are Growers uh

456
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,439
there are smokers there are Growers

457
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,958
there are breeders and then somewhere in

458
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,000
that little in between area uh I'm not

459
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,679
saying they're are less or anything

460
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,039
they're just their own little uh they've

461
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,638
got their own little sect their own

462
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,559
little niche uh they are the land race

463
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
Growers and breeders also off to the

464
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,359
side uh same little category different

465
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,639
category same kind of sect is the

466
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,519
Autoflower group so just smaller

467
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,919
branches of a big group just smaller

468
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,240
branch that have branched off they're

469
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,359
still part of our team but they're doing

470
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,199
a very specific thing I am not in uh

471
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,678
that land race group I'm also not in the

472
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,439
Autoflower group but I can talk enough

473
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,798
about it to sound like I know what I'm

474
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,839
talking about and I can definitely

475
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,720
answer your questions now let's start

476
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,119
this off by talking about what a land

477
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,798
race is many people out there may not

478
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,479
understand what land race genetics are

479
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,519
this question may not make much sense to

480
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,360
a lot of people so let's lay the ground

481
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,918
and talk about what land race genetics

482
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,079
means what is a land race um in my

483
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,320
experience in my research a land race is

484
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,879
basically a strain that is developed

485
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,960
naturally regionally and not interrupted

486
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,240
by humans um so let me give an example

487
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,919
of that let's just say there's a

488
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,120
mountain somewhere in Nepal that nobody

489
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,880
has visited for a very long time

490
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,319
hundreds of years probably nobody's been

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
to this mountain side in Nepal but the

492
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,918
people in Nepal that live there they

493
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,119
have been breeding and growing the same

494
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,600
cultivar for that hundred of years that

495
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,798
nobody has been there there's a hundred

496
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,558
years worth of breeding but no other

497
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,720
genetics have been introduced 100 years

498
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,359
ago there was a crop right it all

499
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
pollinated they didn't pull the boys

500
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,599
they didn't pull the girls then they

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,720
don't pull the seeds those seeds fall

502
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,519
into the ground so we'll say 100 years

503
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,200
ago that was an F1 we're just going to

504
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,359
start there who knows how long ago it

505
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,400
was uh somebody was walking on a trail

506
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,359
at some point they dropped two seeds

507
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,159
those seeds happened they grew there's a

508
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,479
boy and a girl that made more so that

509
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,400
was the F1 then there was F2 then it did

510
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,880
it again now there's F3 it's done it for

511
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,880
a hundred years

512
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,720
uninterrupted growing pollinating itself

513
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,360
falling to the ground and starting over

514
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,159
now the people in these regions may be

515
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,038
collecting these flowers these buds they

516
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,000
may be making hash or doing something

517
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,558
with it but the breeding is being

518
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,919
uninterrupted unadulterated now there

519
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,319
are two things that could be happening

520
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,759
here and I think both of these would

521
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,720
fall into a land race here um there's a

522
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,960
lot of open pollination happening for

523
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,159
sure uh males and females are grown

524
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,038
amongst each other they all the males

525
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,400
pollinate all the females so you've got

526
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,079
all kinds of different genetic

527
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,200
opportunities in there all of the Gen

528
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,000
genetics will be in that breeding if you

529
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,640
get enough seeds you'll find everything

530
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,599
possible within every mom and every

531
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,320
female that's happening naturally the

532
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,319
males pollinate the females they grow

533
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,119
they drop the seeds those seeds grow

534
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,960
keeps happening year after year after

535
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,439
year now my other school of thought is

536
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,558
that some of these Farmers may be

537
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,558
selectively calling males and females

538
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,359
from the crops that don't meet their

539
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,879
standards maybe they can visually see

540
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,678
that one doesn't put out the hash that I

541
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,360
need or the fiber that I need or that

542
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,840
male doesn't make the females that I

543
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,918
need maybe he can visually see that so

544
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,240
he may be removing candidates from the

545
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,799
breeding pool and for the land race

546
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,319
genetics folks out there I don't know

547
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,440
how they feel about that I don't know if

548
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,798
that's within the rules I don't know uh

549
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,120
how that counts like I gave the

550
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,000
disclaimer before I'm not a land race

551
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,119
breeding uh person that is not my area

552
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,558
of expertise but those are the things

553
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,399
that are most likely to happen in those

554
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:52,918
uh those unpopulated regions those

555
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,880
beautiful regions on the planet that we

556
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,280
haven't destroyed and built concrete all

557
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
over everything and put the internet

558
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,240
everywhere uh there are mountain sides

559
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,038
of just endless cannabis plants that are

560
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,159
Untouched by people or maybe slightly

561
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,798
touched by people but they are not

562
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
adulterated by other genetics those are

563
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,319
land race genetics that is the long

564
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,159
description that I said was going to be

565
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,319
short now let me jump into the next part

566
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,840
of this question it says how important

567
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,439
are land race genetics for you in your

568
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,879
breeding work now the quick answer uh

569
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,798
for that one is for me they are not uh

570
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,919
at the point where I am in my breeding

571
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,079
I've made enough things where um I don't

572
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
have to acquire any more plants or seeds

573
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,839
I'm not saying I don't want to but I

574
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,200
could stop uh any incoming plants and

575
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,720
seeds and I could breed for hundred

576
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,038
years I could breed for the rest of my

577
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,640
life with the seed and breeding stock

578
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,558
I've already created so at this point uh

579
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,120
those land races don't excite me don't

580
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,798
interest me I care about them I

581
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,879
definitely understand where they come

582
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,440
from what they are how they are working

583
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,880
in my current crosses and where um what

584
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,320
I can see the traits from around the

585
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
world and we can identify different

586
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,639
things from those land races and how

587
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,039
they are uh playing with my current

588
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,720
breeding but right now at this time um

589
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,960
that's those plants don't interest me

590
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,759
they're not on my radar maybe if there

591
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,919
were an apocalypse and we had to start

592
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,558
over or maybe if I had to start over if

593
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,960
I bred all my stuff into some bottleneck

594
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,359
where it all started coming out to be

595
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,400
lemon chem dog or it was all [ __ ]

596
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,759
golden Tangi or something it all turned

597
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,559
out if I messed it all up uh then maybe

598
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,599
I would go to land race genetics and

599
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,678
start fresh there uh get some Afghan and

600
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,240
maybe some Brazilian and some Thai and

601
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,600
then just start and I got three

602
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,759
different things I can start

603
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,199
triangulating uh within the next 5 or 10

604
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,359
years I can have a lot of stuff

605
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,840
generated to play with at that point uh

606
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,678
we could be doing a lot of fun feno

607
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,639
hunts but um to me not very important

608
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,798
but to a very certain niche of people

609
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,278
out there those land races mean

610
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,400
everything and it sounds like this may

611
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,880
be um some direction you might want to

612
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,440
go just by the question let me keep

613
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,400
myself focused CU whatever I smoked once

614
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,480
again it has got me going today it was

615
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,320
the Cherry pot pie concentrates from our

616
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,599
friends at Green DOL they do not pay me

617
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,000
to say that but if you want to shout out

618
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,558
to Green do laabs you know how to get in

619
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,759
touch with me where is we now it says

620
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,480
with people constantly traveling around

621
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,798
and the ongoing search for shorter

622
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,960
flowering periods in commercial growing

623
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,000
How likely is it to find real or even

624
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,759
new land races

625
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,759
anymore um the answer I wrote down is

626
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,599
you got to go where Arian hasn't been um

627
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,240
Arian rosam is the founder and breeder

628
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,719
for Greenhouse seed company and I've got

629
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,400
respect for his breeding I love what

630
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,720
he's done with the industry the world he

631
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
runs coffee shops in Amsterdam uh the

632
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,079
dude's got one of the most successful

633
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,320
seed companies in the planet probably

634
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,759
more cannabis Cups than uh most people

635
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,319
that I can think of the dude's got a lot

636
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,240
of awards um but he does something that

637
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,038
is um it's it gets my attention here and

638
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,558
it fits into this this conversation

639
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,759
Arian and his crew fly around to those

640
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,158
locations I was talking about where

641
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:57,599
cannabis has been unadulterated for

642
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,919
hundreds of years um I'm going to I'm

643
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,879
guessing hundreds of years I really

644
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,720
don't know like I said not the land race

645
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,840
guy but these land race plants have been

646
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,159
growing unadulterated for years and

647
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,639
years um our buddy Arion goes there um

648
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
meets with the right people they take

649
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,360
him to these Farms he meets the farmers

650
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,000
they give him permission to go into the

651
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,158
fields and he collects the seeds they

652
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,720
say do what you want to do bro taking a

653
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,600
couple of handfuls of seeds from us

654
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,038
isn't going to hurt have a good time out

655
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,678
there in the field enjoy yourself take

656
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,839
pictures uh they're they're very

657
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,798
gracious hosts so Arian and his friends

658
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,119
they go and they gather seeds and then

659
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,079
they take the seeds back to their

660
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,038
Greenhouse uh back to Amsterdam to their

661
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,359
business Greenhouse they grow them they

662
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,839
find things they breed with it um cool

663
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,519
that's how breeding should work that's

664
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,918
that's not a problem what they do that

665
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,359
kind of uh puts some alarms up puts up

666
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,038
some red flags and makes me uh concerned

667
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,399
with what they're doing a little bit

668
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:50,158
while they are there while they are on

669
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,320
these uh sacred land if you want want to

670
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,559
call it on these little plots of

671
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,759
cannabis on uh unadulterated cannabis

672
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,038
plots they are leaving the farmers with

673
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,079
seeds that they have made in Amsterdam

674
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,158
uh that

675
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,158
um they are a lot of their popular and

676
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,000
famous feminized seeds I could tell

677
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,278
because when they passed them the seeds

678
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,119
they were colorcoded a greenhouse Seed

679
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,519
Company dips their seeds in a color code

680
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,479
so you could tell which seeds are which

681
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,798
if you lose the package you can have a

682
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,159
whole bag of Skittles and you know that

683
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,918
all the yellow ones are Super Lemon

684
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,200
Hayes and I don't remember the color

685
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,120
code but they are colorcoded and so I

686
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,360
saw Arian give this guy handfuls of

687
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,959
color-coded seeds and now that guy's

688
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,918
going to go perhaps possibly maybe grow

689
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,120
those outdoors in that sacred

690
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,278
unadulterated land race cannabis plot

691
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,839
and now they've been adulterated now

692
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,519
there's new [ __ ] happening out there

693
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,240
there's new uh new jeans in the breeding

694
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,839
pool um new [ __ ] has come to light man

695
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,519
and I don't know how I feel about that

696
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,439
so um traveling around and doing

697
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,599
research uh How likely is it to find

698
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,278
real land races you've got to go where

699
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,798
Arian hasn't been um you've got to go

700
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:57,440
find go where the people don't go go

701
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,918
where uh find what region interests you

702
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,480
like there are several regions where

703
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,720
these land races are research them of

704
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,919
course think about where all of our

705
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,038
favorite cannabis comes there's

706
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,720
Brazilian there's Thai there's Afghan um

707
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,879
there's Pakistani weed that's really

708
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,360
[ __ ] good um there's weed from all

709
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
over the world but think about what weed

710
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,599
gets your attention and [ __ ] maybe

711
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,399
it's napali weed maybe it's somewhere

712
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,240
maybe it's somewhere real fun maybe it's

713
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:22,918
somewhere real sketchy but think about

714
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,558
where that weed comes from and go there

715
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,759
and start meeting people and build

716
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,678
relationships and let them know hey I'm

717
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,599
a Weed Farmer I'm a seed Hunter I'm

718
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,480
looking for the seeds from this region

719
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,480
so I can preserve them and start my own

720
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,440
project and do something uh for the

721
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,159
plant for the good of this plant and

722
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,759
people uh Farmers find each other ganja

723
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,000
heads find each other mushroom people

724
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,759
find each other uh I think the land race

725
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,480
folk uh if this is what you're meant to

726
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,960
do the world will put this into your uh

727
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,759
your lap it will happen for you you're

728
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,159
going to have to do some work but go to

729
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,480
those places go get those seeds or start

730
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,080
doing some networking on the internet

731
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,000
and trust people build relationships

732
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,000
with someone you trust get some land R

733
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,720
seeds from them but uh they're still

734
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
around the the land races are still

735
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,240
around there are plenty of places on the

736
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,600
earth that are untouched um there are a

737
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,480
lot of great places to go get these

738
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,079
seeds you just have to decide what you

739
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,038
want where to go get them and then

740
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,960
develop a relationship and go there and

741
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,919
acquire those seeds then you got to get

742
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,000
them back to the States sometimes that's

743
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,919
the fun part but that's on you my dude I

744
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
can't encourage you to do anything weird

745
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,159
all right now the next part of the

746
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,679
question says if they are still around

747
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,000
how do professional breeders separate an

748
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,120
original land race from the mini hybrids

749
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,480
and strain crosses out there um so if

750
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,398
it's a land race it doesn't have um like

751
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,120
so you know most strains so it's like

752
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:40,359
we'll say let me pick a strain out of

753
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,359
the top of my head I'm just searching

754
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:44,759
for something right now lemon Jeffrey uh

755
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,119
lemon Jeffrey says Lemon Skunk X which

756
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,038
means bread to or crossed or times a lot

757
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,719
of people say Golden Goat you got your

758
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,798
lemon Jeffrey X Golden Goat in

759
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,759
parenthesis that is or your Lemon Skunk

760
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,759
Golden Goat that's lemon Jeffrey if it's

761
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,679
a land race it's just going to say

762
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,919
Pakistani

763
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,798
that's all it is it's not going to have

764
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,080
other stuff that's why it's a land race

765
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,599
it's that Pakistani land race or that

766
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,879
Nepali land race or that congales hand

767
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,879
land race um it could be from a lot of

768
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,919
different places but the land races uh

769
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,278
they're not going to be crossed to

770
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,720
anything and you could tell by the way

771
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,839
that they grow uh they grow wildly a lot

772
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,159
of the times they don't have the

773
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,119
uniformity of any of the modern strains

774
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,360
because they haven't been bred they

775
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,719
haven't been selected for that uh Nature

776
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,079
has been selecting them it's the battle

777
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,720
of the fittest for the last 100 years uh

778
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,519
what grew the best is what grew the best

779
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,480
out there so if it's a land race you

780
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,200
probably got it from another land race

781
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,319
seed seller or Enthusiast or you went

782
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,120
and got it or it came from somebody from

783
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,158
that region um how do professional

784
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,079
breeders separate uh it's just because

785
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,720
it's not adulterated it's from that

786
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,519
region and you know where your seeds

787
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,519
came from and a lot of times you could

788
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,720
tell when you grow it out the modern

789
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,159
modern bread stuff uh is breed for

790
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,440
social media it's bred for photography

791
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,039
to sell seeds in magazines that's what a

792
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,440
lot of the [ __ ] on social media is is um

793
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,440
some of my best strains are not the most

794
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,240
photogenic some of my most photogenic

795
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,798
strains are not the best um a lot of the

796
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,480
stuff that you see online uh is bread

797
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,798
they're picking the best phenotype for

798
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,880
the internet and taking a picture of it

799
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:15,558
and selling seeds based on the colors of

800
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,440
the leaves and the amount of frost on

801
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:20,200
there but you don't know if that plant's

802
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
got any resistance to bugs or pathogens

803
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,798
or the potency and a lot of times it

804
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,919
tastes like [ __ ] cardboard but at

805
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,480
this point I am rambling let me get back

806
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,159
on track here to the next bullet point

807
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,519
in this question anyway if you want

808
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,799
those real hybrids you got to go get

809
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,240
them or get them from a true land race

810
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,720
Enthusiast now the next part are F1

811
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,679
hybrids based on land races more

812
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
vigorous than crosses that are derived

813
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,200
from other crossed strains I think I

814
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
kind of mentioned this part I don't know

815
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,840
about more vigorous because you get that

816
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,360
F1 hybrid Vigor um almost in um most of

817
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:54,199
the crosses that you make even if it's

818
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,359
modern stuff to old stuff or modern to

819
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,919
Modern old to old if you got healthy

820
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,678
plants and you put those to new genes

821
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,320
together uh most often you're going to

822
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,159
get some hybrid Vigor what you're going

823
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,720
to see with these uh land races the

824
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,840
words I wrote down is more wild they're

825
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,640
much more wild since they're uh these

826
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,278
are like Untamed animals these have

827
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,200
never seen a cage they've never had a

828
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,398
leash they're just [ __ ] flailing

829
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
they're going crazy um maybe the leaves

830
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:21,879
are crazy the branching is crazy the

831
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,480
structure is undesirable but that's not

832
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,440
like I said that it happened in nature

833
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,079
you've got to find the good [ __ ] in

834
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,320
there with the traits you like and breed

835
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:32,678
that the direction you want so um are

836
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,678
the hybrids based on land races more

837
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,240
vigorous um I would not say more

838
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,320
vigorous I'm going to say more wild

839
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,759
you're going to get Vigor you're going

840
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,119
to get hybrid Vigor but they're going to

841
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,798
find some wild [ __ ] in there all right

842
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,398
uh my buddy Stephan says thanks for your

843
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,200
input dude thank you for a great

844
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,518
question for letting me ramble like I

845
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,600
said I'm not the land race guy so I

846
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,240
don't know all of the land race details

847
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,959
but I hope I was able to answer your

848
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,558
question thoroughly and don't forget to

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,799
momentum going I do have another great

853
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,880
question here in front of me let's go

854
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,200
with this one right now this one came

855
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,440
from a friend in Germany guten taga and

856
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,080
F Vates I hope everything is good over

857
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,798
there in Germany the question starts off

858
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:20,439
with guten to rasted Jeff first of all I

859
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,200
love your show and I learned a lot hey

860
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,960
thank you for listening in Germany it's

861
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,080
amazing to hear that I have got German

862
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,399
listeners uh that's amazing to know that

863
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:31,000
we are international it's say my

864
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,599
question is about fast flowering plants

865
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,278
yes these fast flowering plants have

866
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,918
been all the trend lately it says I have

867
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,599
read that they are bred with autof

868
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:43,080
flowers to lower the flowering time and

869
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,959
that low flowering time is what I need I

870
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,319
understand all of the new Growers uh one

871
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,679
of the first things that are after uh is

872
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,200
fast flowering plants and I'm sure that

873
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,679
uh a lot of people in Germany are

874
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,759
looking for fast flowering plants so I

875
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,278
hope I'm able to answer your questions

876
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,960
here it says I live in Germany and I

877
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,000
like to grow outdoors but Autumn is cold

878
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,759
and wet yes I'm sure it does get cold

879
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,720
and wet it says in addition here I get

880
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,038
1212 around the 1st of September um yeah

881
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,399
our seasons are different so I'm not

882
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,200
sure where that lines up it says it's a

883
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:17,879
gamble every year what do you think

884
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,440
about these fast flowering plants do you

885
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,480
have any experience or is it possible to

886
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,038
create a strain that starts flowering at

887
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,558
1410 thanks in advance and keep on

888
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,879
rolling maybe we are legal when you read

889
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:31,798
this on on YouTube I think you are legal

890
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,799
now uh with some stipulations and

891
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,359
regulations so let's start by saying

892
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:38,158
congratulations to our friends out there

893
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,638
in Germany for their progress with

894
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,120
legalization now let's uh let's answer

895
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:44,119
some of these questions here the first

896
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,959
one uh have I played with the fast

897
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,599
flowering plants no uh I have not myself

898
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,679
played with fast flowering plants I

899
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,798
prefer longer flowering plants I think

900
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,000
they give me better quality and more

901
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:58,038
yield but I understand that

902
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,519
situationally uh that is not always

903
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:03,759
ideal so I do not mess with the fast

904
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,079
flowering um then the next part is um

905
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,839
can we create strains that flower at

906
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:14,599
1410 honestly I bet there are strains

907
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:16,759
that flower at 1410 already but any hom

908
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,798
grower or home breeder that is growing

909
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:22,319
indoors has eliminated those from their

910
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,319
breeding project or their selection

911
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,918
because it did not work for their indoor

912
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,158
grow it just wasn't doing what they

913
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,759
wanted so it probably got uh cold and

914
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,519
eliminated um most people are doing 1212

915
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,319
indoors now real quickly I'm going to

916
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,679
touch back on previous episodes and talk

917
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,918
about something called far red lighting

918
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,600
uh you're asking about a plant that

919
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,200
flowers at 14 hours of light and 10

920
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,119
hours of darkness is what I think you're

921
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,000
talking about so um a lot of times you

922
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,000
may look outside and you may think that

923
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,278
you've got that 14 hours of light out

924
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,398
there but what actually happens is as

925
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:58,558
that sun sets that is putting off a red

926
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:00,678
light spectrum known as far red lighting

927
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,638
that far red lighting triggers a

928
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,440
phytochrome response in your plants that

929
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,959
tells the plants it is time to go to

930
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,600
sleep so I'm certain that there are some

931
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,399
plants out there that that 14-hour day

932
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,199
when you see the 14 hours that's

933
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,398
probably probably 13 or 12 hours of

934
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,960
actual usable sunlight uh because you've

935
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,918
got the rising spectrum and the setting

936
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,639
Spectrum are a little bit different I

937
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,519
bet you there are plenty of plants out

938
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,359
there that will flower with that 14

939
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,159
hours of daylight that is actually

940
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,798
called the critical period how many

941
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,399
hours of dark Ness it takes for a plant

942
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,839
to flower uh that is probably dependent

943
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:36,959
on uh the location on the globe or in

944
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,519
relation to the equator where that plant

945
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
came from so I would assume that there

946
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,159
are plants out there that would flower

947
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,360
with that 14-hour light cycle and that

948
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,440
leads me to another option have you

949
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,398
considered Autoflower plants I

950
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,798
understand you want fast flowering but

951
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,879
why not just give a try with Autoflower

952
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:55,839
plants that may be another very viable

953
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,440
option um I've got a good friend that

954
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,439
grows outdoors here in Colorado he does

955
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,558
two sometimes three crops with our

956
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,919
outdoor season when most people get one

957
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,638
outdoor crop so what my buddy does he

958
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,480
puts a round of regular photo period

959
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,398
plants outside so he's got his photo

960
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,878
period plants outside those are going to

961
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,838
go into flower uh he puts them outside

962
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,039
as soon as the weather permits I think

963
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,679
that's Mother's Day here in Colorado

964
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:23,000
also he will put a round of Autoflower

965
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,720
plants out on Mother's Day so he's got

966
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,480
one plant of photos one plant of Autos

967
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,239
now both of these plants begin to grow

968
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,639
but but eventually the autof flowers

969
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,799
will go into flower and they will flower

970
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,039
and by the time they finish now the

971
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,519
photo periods start going into flower so

972
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:40,559
he chops one down and then he reloads

973
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,440
that plot with more autof flowers and

974
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,440
then by the time the other crop finishes

975
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,039
he's got two more crops done at the same

976
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,559
time so he runs one photo period crop

977
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,599
outdoors and two Autoflower crops

978
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,878
Outdoors he get gets three crops in the

979
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,919
time that most people get one and one

980
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,358
big advantage to those autof flowers as

981
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,639
they are done way before the thieves and

982
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,159
the Rippers and the frost get out there

983
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,199
uh to destroy your plants cuz in

984
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:06,759
Colorado uh people know we're growing

985
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,559
weed they start looking out for it they

986
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,440
come steal it about a week before

987
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,559
Harvest people will come take it if you

988
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,519
ran Auto flowers you're done way before

989
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,358
that time period even approaches so the

990
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,440
root of the question was about fast

991
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:20,279
flowering plants I don't have any

992
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,639
experience with the autof flowers or the

993
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,760
fast flowers but I know there are very

994
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,920
good uses for both maybe if you've got

995
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,560
the opportunity plant a row of both do

996
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,720
some fast fly flowers do a row of

997
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,279
autoflow and if you want to get frisky

998
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,959
maybe even put out a row of photo period

999
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,720
plants out in the grow space um I love

1000
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,720
these questions from New Markets as new

1001
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,319
markets come on uh there will be new

1002
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,919
questions new demands um something you

1003
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,359
may want to think about you said you

1004
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,318
have got the cold and wet weather in

1005
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:51,318
Autumn maybe just maybe uh you may want

1006
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:53,719
to do some breeding and develop a strain

1007
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:55,039
that works very well in your climate if

1008
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,358
you're one of the first Growers out

1009
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,800
there to get a head start and start

1010
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,318
breeding outdoor plants in your region

1011
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,960
that are already adapted to your

1012
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,199
environment and ready for your

1013
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,559
conditions uh you will be far ahead of

1014
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:09,358
the market and those seeds will sell

1015
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:12,279
very well to every outdoor farmer in

1016
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,400
your region uh every section and region

1017
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,960
that it works you can sell those seeds

1018
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,800
they probably work indoors as well all

1019
