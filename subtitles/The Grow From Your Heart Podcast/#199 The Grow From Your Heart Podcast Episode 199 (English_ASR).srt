00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,288

198
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,859
rambling about that but it really meant

199
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,810
a lot you guys

200
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,460
it's huge when people give you praise

201
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,870
for the work that you do in person when

202
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,310
you get to meet a large group of people

203
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,288
and they're thanking you for what you do

204
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,970
it means a lot especially people that

205
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,319
you know are already able to grow

206
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,260
without your guidance like dude you push

207
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,579
me to the next level that means a lot so

208
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,228
like I said it wasn't even and we were

209
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,490
going to talk a little bit about judging

210
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,158
the event I like the way that they did

211
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,050
this a lot of the events we go to the

212
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:01,418
judges are offered a judge's pack or

213
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,129
you're given a bag with every entry

214
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:05,019
labeled with a number and then you're

215
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,120
supposed to consume that and your choice

216
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:09,219
of method if it's a bowl a joint however

217
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,930
you want to do it so say there are 40

218
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,340
entries you're given little baggies with

219
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,329
numbers one through forty written on it

220
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,310
and you've got to take your own notes

221
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,810
and decide what the winner was they did

222
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,220
it a little bit differently at the dude

223
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,899
gross Cup and I kind of like the way

224
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,389
that they did it instead of giving

225
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:25,569
everybody a gift bag there was a section

226
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,090
ah one whole section of the venue where

227
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,500
there were little bud bud tender

228
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:33,189
stations lined up there were basically

229
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,990
countertops with jars of samples of

230
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,889
entries and all of those jars were

231
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,269
labeled with a number

232
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,620
like I said I think there were about 50

233
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,959
entries so they were labeled one through

234
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,918
fifty and you would stand in line and he

235
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,688
would go up to the front and then you

236
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,639
would tell the the budtender

237
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:47,110
what number samples he wanted to try and

238
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,189
the bud tenders had a few different

239
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,749
samples in front of him it looked like

240
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,699
each bud tinder had three or four four

241
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:53,080
or five different samples so you'd walk

242
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,669
up you get in line you'd walk up to one

243
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,050
gate like I want to try whatever he had

244
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:57,878
in front of him one two three four five

245
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,590
and they would give you a fresh one

246
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,999
hitter when you started so you had a

247
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,948
brand new little clean one hitter pipe

248
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:04,240
and then you get to smoke each sample

249
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,370
but you got to stand in line a few times

250
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,620
to get through every sample it was a

251
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,090
cool way of doing it instead of just

252
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,439
sitting there and hoarding your 50

253
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,149
sample pack it made it a little more

254
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,919
communal because everybody had to go up

255
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,810
to that one area where the samples were

256
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,188
and he had to meet the budtender and he

257
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,870
kind of had to hang out and be in line

258
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,210
and that being in line right there

259
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,149
forced more people to interact because

260
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:26,709
when I see a lot of it these events uh I

261
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,138
used to go with Kevin a lot I would go

262
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,549
with pops uh now a lot of the times I

263
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,339
end up up there with the traveling

264
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,990
stoner and bubble blaster Co and Bret

265
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,459
from evil labs we've got kind of clicky

266
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,079
we've gotten kind of click is what I

267
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,668
think I'm trying to say and when you put

268
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:41,769
us all in a line like that to go taste

269
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:43,569
the samples all those clicks go away

270
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,100
because you end up in line next to other

271
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,570
people for five minutes and then you end

272
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,889
up making friends with new people and I

273
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,110
really like that aspect of it it was

274
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,970
really cool I knew some people when I

275
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,709
walked in there I knew a lot of people

276
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,820
when I left there was a really good

277
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:59,948
social experience a lot of the other dab

278
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,410
and smoke events that we go to do seem

279
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:03,338
to be a little clicky a little elitist a

280
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,069
little there's a little bit of a

281
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,750
[ __ ] vibe at them there wasn't any

282
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,430
ego at this event this was a bunch of

283
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,220
people hanging out smoking out and one

284
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,049
cool thing that they did they they did a

285
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,009
huge raffle they were selling tickets

286
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:19,539
for this raffle dirty cheap and I kind

287
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,610
of regret not participating in the

288
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:24,129
raffle but there wasn't anything that I

289
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,419
absolutely would have loved to have have

290
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,698
but they were giving away [ __ ] deluxe

291
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:29,289
bulbs they were giving away double ended

292
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:31,539
ceramic metal halide bulbs which are

293
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:34,360
brand new they were giving away nutrient

294
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:35,649
packs they gave away tons of stuff you

295
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,810
guys I've given away a few things on the

296
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:39,159
spot cast they gave away a truckload of

297
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,198
stuff I've got a nice little kitchen

298
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,909
area here where I record the girl from

299
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:44,679
the heart podcast studio is honestly my

300
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,629
dining room all of the stuff they gave

301
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,278
away would fill this space in a little

302
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,720
pile that's all my [ __ ] they gave away

303
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,610
so I thought it was super cool

304
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,709
the dude grows cup was able to give back

305
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,629
to the cannabis community I'm pretty

306
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:58,208
sure way to grow sponsored them mammoth

307
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,800
P sponsored them there was a bunch of

308
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,049
whose the company that they use recharge

309
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,669
recharge was heavily involved so there's

310
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:05,349
a bunch of good giveaways they gave away

311
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,120
a bunch of [ __ ] deluxe bulbs I think

312
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,420
they gave away a quest dehumidifier

313
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,709
bunch of [ __ ] was given away ah so huge

314
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,969
shout at some things for giving stuff

315
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,669
away that means a lot to me that they

316
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,319
give back I was gonna talk about um I

317
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:19,479
talked about the entries and I talked a

318
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:21,399
little bit about the judging now I kind

319
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,769
of want to talk a little bit about what

320
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,360
I saw from the entries there were

321
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,929
approximately 50 entries from what I

322
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,220
remember and I was able to I did kind of

323
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,229
an [ __ ] move but I just wanted to be

324
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,579
quick about it and I think I made myself

325
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,778
clear on what I was trying to do to

326
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:37,359
anybody who's paying attention so

327
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:38,528
imagine all the lines are going one way

328
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,068
right the lines are run it back and

329
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:41,139
forth

330
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,909
I walked up about three people into the

331
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,049
line and I didn't cut anybody cuz I

332
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,208
wasn't getting in the line but I just

333
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,039
cut through the wrong way I just like I

334
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,119
crossed all the intersections and I

335
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,919
walked from one end to the other and

336
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,889
just eyeballed all of the samples I just

337
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,568
gave a quick visual visual glance kind

338
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,600
of a flyby X I'm so tall I just did a

339
00:10:55,568 --> 00:11:00,308
flyover and crept it all the tables to

340
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,569
see what the samples looked like and

341
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:03,490
they gave me a good idea of what I

342
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,958
wanted to try before I even got in line

343
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,209
to waste my time to go smoke some

344
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,899
samples I'm not trying to be an [ __ ]

345
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:13,508
here I'm gonna say that 40 of those 50

346
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:15,759
samples needed to be trimmed they did

347
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,079
not trim them worth a [ __ ] there were

348
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,528
samples in there that could have been

349
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,989
winners

350
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:22,448
if the grower or trimmer would have

351
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,009
taken another step and just knock off

352
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,169
all those little shitty leaves that were

353
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,399
on there Jesse said yeah they do you

354
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,099
have a bunch of trichomes on those

355
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,688
leaves but it doesn't look good and it's

356
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,519
not appealing to me and I'm certain that

357
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:34,990
it effects the flavor and you can knock

358
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,549
those trichomes off and put it into your

359
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,759
hash and make some concentrates out of

360
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,948
it so I think the main problem that I

361
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,539
saw with most of the the product most of

362
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,799
the entries was that it was not trimmed

363
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,870
there was some ribs there was something

364
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,269
that tasted like a blueberry I'd had a

365
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,198
real funky blueberry flavor to it that

366
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,028
one was delicious

367
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:54,698
there was one that was definitely Girl

368
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:56,289
Scout cookies I dominant that one was

369
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:57,879
delicious there was one that looked like

370
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,169
it was gonna be real good but it tasted

371
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,259
kind of hey like and kind of burnt my

372
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,139
tongue then all of the others I kind of

373
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,239
ignored because

374
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,669
were so leafy that it didn't even look

375
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:10,189
appealing to smoke so let's talk a

376
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:13,488
little bit about how to trim your

377
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:15,708
products if you want the best bag appeal

378
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:18,109
and if you intend on entering something

379
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,399
into a cup that is going to be judged so

380
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,600
let's talk about that but first I need

381
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,278
to take a DAB in a drink so I feel like

382
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,389
I'm talking away too fast so I'm gonna

383
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:24,980
take care of my head in my face

384
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,928
hopefully you guys take a quick dab too

385
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,459
and then I'll be right back all right

386
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:33,168
back I'm well hydrated I'm well

387
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,118
medicated I'm smoking some golden goat

388
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:37,428
shatter today shout out to the barefoot

389
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:39,319
grower barefoot extracts for keeping me

390
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:41,720
laced up with super fresh super clean

391
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:43,998
super delicious super potent shatter

392
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,399
good job dude good job I appreciate it I

393
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,168
grow the products and then I pass it

394
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,119
over to our buddy will and he takes care

395
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:52,759
of the extraction process for me there's

396
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:55,009
nothing like knowing that the products

397
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,289
you're dabbing were grown with love and

398
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,459
extracted with love there's something

399
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,988
something sweet about knowing there's

400
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,208
safety and quality in your medicine I

401
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:04,220
really enjoy it before we go into

402
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,479
talking about proper trim technique

403
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,649
there are a couple things I missed in

404
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,558
the intro here because I was just

405
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,879
rambling my face off I mentioned in

406
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,798
previous episodes that I was going to

407
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,298
record a podcast at the dude gross cup

408
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:15,558
that did not happen you guys I had all

409
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:18,499
the recording equipment that I needed

410
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:20,208
with me it was really loud in there I

411
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:22,100
would not have been able to get any

412
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,048
useful recording even if I did try to

413
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,249
set up and record the music was [ __ ]

414
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:27,588
loud there were a bunch of people in

415
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:29,028
there you had to kind of yell and it

416
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,499
sucks when you're in a place that loud

417
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:32,269
and you were smoking dabs and you're

418
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:34,249
trying to yell over everybody that's

419
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,039
kind of why that's why my voice sounds

420
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,959
like I am a mr. Moviefone

421
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,759
press one if you know the name of the

422
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,018
movie you'd like to see that's that's

423
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,199
from taking too many dads and trying to

424
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,759
yell over everybody all night so excuse

425
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,618
the throat and the excessive throat

426
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,778
clearing but that's why I did not record

427
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,730
that's why there is no live stuff coming

428
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:55,788
from the dude grows cup that I recorded

429
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,739
also I talked about the judging I never

430
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:59,538
talked about the voting when he walked

431
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,459
into the dude Rose Cup you were given a

432
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,588
lanyard which meant you were a judge and

433
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,488
around the lanyard are the it's right

434
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,749
over there it's out of reach I'm not

435
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:08,298
gonna walk away from microphone to get

436
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:09,859
it but around the lanyard are numbers

437
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,568
and that's how many entries there were

438
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:13,788
so when you go and you sample the entry

439
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:15,588
they punch that number off of your

440
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,490
lanyard say they know the tubes tested

441
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,440
sample number one

442
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,000
and then they were so number one two

443
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,740
three four or five however many injuries

444
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,659
there are I think there were 40 maybe 50

445
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,070
they punch out the number that you've

446
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:26,659
tried so that that way you can't just

447
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,830
keep smoking the same entries over and

448
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:29,299
over so that if you fall in love with

449
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,720
one he can't go smoke all of it

450
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:34,699
so the voting went also when you walked

451
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,779
in they gave you some tokens they look

452
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,759
like some Pirates of the Caribbean

453
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,779
tokens they're just plastic tokens they

454
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,059
probably got him from the dollar store

455
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,129
the party store or something but there

456
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,559
are some plastic tokens and if you

457
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:48,350
appreciate it a strain you were to give

458
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,179
the budtender that token and ask them to

459
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,470
put it the jars were behind them so you

460
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,729
would give them the token and they would

461
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,220
put it in the number you'd say hey I

462
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,840
like number 22 the best we throw this

463
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,550
token into number 22 and I think you

464
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,830
were given five tokens when he walked in

465
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,089
and he were also given one free raffle

466
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,520
ticket when he walked in so that you had

467
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,200
it to everybody won something but I left

468
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,600
before the end of the raffle because the

469
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,520
raffle was taking for freaking ever and

470
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,690
then they even Scotty and the dude had

471
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,939
to take a break in the middle because

472
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,140
the raffle was taking so long so I've

473
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,150
talked about the voting I talked about

474
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,220
the tokens they gave us I apologize for

475
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,169
not recording any live material at the

476
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,090
event honestly you guys I was having a

477
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:25,099
good ass time taking dad's with my old

478
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,500
friends and my new friends it was cool

479
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,500
introducing so Jesse Jesse grows is a

480
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,210
cool guy he's a little bit shy I don't

481
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,240
know that shy I don't he's just not as

482
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,500
socially outgoing as myself and so when

483
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,269
people would start talking to me

484
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,710
sometimes I need a little bit of a break

485
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,029
my throat starts burning out and I want

486
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,530
to take a DAB and chill so I'd be like

487
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,139
hey that's Jesse from the show and

00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:00,359
read all about how to contribute to the

556
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,250
Grove from your heart a podcast patreon

557
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,500
is a service that allows listeners to

558
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,240
financially contribute to podcasts we're

559
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,210
not trying to get rich it costs us money

560
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,069
to put the website up so that we can

561
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,808
host the show guys my website sucks I'm

562
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,939
sorry I do not spend a lot of time

563
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:18,240
working on my website right now it's

564
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,460
basically just a it's a crash but that's

565
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,140
how my podcast is hosted to itunes to

566
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,909
stitcher to Feedburner to pod Bay

567
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,860
wherever else you're watching it that's

568
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,450
how it's happening is through my website

569
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,879
so when you go to patreon when you

570
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,679
contribute what that funding does that

571
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,419
helps me pay for my Bluehost account

572
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,620
which pays for my website that's what

573
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,840
that does so if you want to help out a

574
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,489
podcaster most podcasters do have a

575
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,029
patreon account so you can go to my

576
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,579
patreon

577
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,849
it's a patreon.com slash girl from your

578
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,889
heart

579
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:46,500

591
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,639
podcasting alright I keep talking about

592
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:13,470
trim and weed I'm holding this Kabletown

593
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,580
nugget in my hand it's I could use a

594
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,679
little bit of love it can use some

595
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,678
attention to give you some trimming

596
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,480
let's talk about trimming your weed I

597
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,038
don't want to go into too much detail

598
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,808
about harvesting because I've done

599
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,240
complete episodes about harvesting full

600
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:28,859
plants that is a whole nother podcast

601
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,029
and if it's not in the feed I'm sure you

602
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,918
guys are aware that I've been putting

603
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,389
old episodes out on Thursdays I put

604
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,100
chunks of three or four episodes out

605
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,460
every Thursday those are episodes from

606
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:40,589
the past a long long time ago the show

607
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,029
used to be called agriculture there's

608
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:44,759
another organization that goes by the

609
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,139
name hi grow I kindly changed my name so

610
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,579
that I don't get myself in any trouble I

611
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,259
don't want to be associated with them on

612
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,548
accident so now the show is called the

613
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,129
grow from your heart podcast which is

614
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:54,210
much more suiting in my opinion but

615
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,159
anyway I've been putting out old

616
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,808
episodes because a lot of the episodes

617
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,630
fall out of the feed iTunes and stitcher

618
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:02,129
only hold 100 episodes and a lot of the

619
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,590
good stuff is in the past and the old

620
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,520
episodes we're up to 200 now and there's

621
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:07,048
that means there's a hundred episodes

622
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,879
that are no longer in the feed so I'm

623
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:10,288
going to put in chunks out so that I can

624
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,210
try to get those old episodes in the

625
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:14,339
feed without knocking out current stuff

626
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,558
another thing I'm doing is I am making

627
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,168
those YouTube videos I talk about that a

628
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,879
lot it's coming it's time-consuming I

629
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:22,320
have a life I have a lot going on I'm

630
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,940
trying to get those out for you but I'm

631
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,678
trying to get the old episodes so the

632
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,169
episode all about harvesting will be

633
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,880
either in the feed on YouTube or coming

634
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,919
soon in those old episodes is what I'm

635
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,020
getting to today we're just gonna talk

636
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,640
about the kind of fun the final fine

637
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,099
trim let's say you've harvested your

638
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,288
plant I will just will real quickly go

639
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,109
over this you flushed your plant that is

640
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:45,390
the beginning of harvest flush you all

641
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,908
you need to do is feed your plants clean

642
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,860
pH balanced water it's free all you

643
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,270
gotta do is get a container however many

644
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,908
plants you use however much water you

645
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,750
use fill that container use some pH up

646
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:58,000
or pH down probably pH down

647
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,679
most locations use some pH down get that

648
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,720
water to the proper pH you wandered

649
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,538
around somewhere between 6 and 6.5

650
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,779
that's up to you I like to do about 6.2

651
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:10,240
when I'm flushing pH that water 26.2 and

652
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,639
pour it through the plants and for the

653
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,970
next days next 10 days just keep doing

654
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,409
that

655
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,058
don't ever add nutrients whenever the

656
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,110
plants get you water them you let them

657
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,089
get dry and show you that they're

658
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,189
thirsty mix up some more water that's

659
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:22,750
six point two and water those plants you

660
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,940
do that for at least ten days you can do

661
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,460
it for 10 to 14 maybe 17 I've seen

662
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,840
people do it for 21 full days all you

663
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,100
got to do is flush your plants it's free

664
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,990
you don't have to put nutrients in there

665
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:34,629
that's that much nutrients you were

666
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,829
saving flush your damn plants sorry I

667
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,450
get on a rant when I talk about flushing

668
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,939
because it's so easy and people do not

669
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,558
do it and it's evident as soon as I take

670
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,720
a hit off your bowl before that smoke

671
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,490
hits my lungs I can say you didn't flush

672
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,259
that and the funny part is one of our

673
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,480
friends that I met at the dude grows cup

674
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:51,038
passed me some weed and he's like this

675
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,048
one's got like a spicy taste to it and I

676
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,519
hit it and I blew out the hit before I

677
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:56,889
got my smoke all the way out of my lungs

678
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,369
I could taste it and I said do you use

679
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,750
worm casting tea in your in your mix and

680
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,339
he said yes and I said I think you're

681
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,140
using a little too much worm castings

682
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:08,230
because I can taste compost and worm

683
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,669
castings and his buddy excuse me my

684
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,980
throat's clogging up I apologise let me

685
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,780
take a quick drink anyway this dude's

686
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,069
friend said I told you you've been going

687
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,298
too hard with the worm casting so I

688
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,470
could taste that [ __ ] in there so floss

689
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:19,808
your plants that's what I'm saying and

690
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,220
don't use too much stuff it's hard to

691
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:23,589
flush out anything that you've used

692
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,058
excessively I like veg bloom you guys it

693
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,829
seems to flush out really clean that's

694
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,658
not a paid advertisement or anything but

695
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:32,319
veg bloom seems like it flushed out very

696
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,450
nicely in my plants so flush then pre

697
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,250
trim you can go in and take off all the

698
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,690
large leaves a few days before harvest

699
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,909
just chop those off take them off it

700
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,029
makes it easier then cut your plants

701
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:44,830
down let them hang upside down you can

702
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,839
either wet trim or dry trim at this

703
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,980
point wet trim obviously means you go at

704
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,058
them while they're still wet you're

705
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,589
gonna need some scissors

706
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:52,599
you're gonna need gloves no matter how

707
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:54,459
you do this wear gloves please get

708
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,589
yourself some nitrile gloves some latex

709
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,509
gloves glove up you don't want trichomes

710
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:00,099
all over yourself and I don't want to

711
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:02,890
smoke your skin flakes that shit's gross

712
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:05,469
so get some gloves they're cheap they're

713
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,090
affordable just go to go to Walgreens go

714
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,759
to Walmart I like to order mine off of

715
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,230
Amazon

716
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,730
come they come straight to the house if

717
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,920
you're gonna buy a bunch I recommend

718
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,059
uline uline sells a lot of gloves but

719
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,250
you gotta buy a bunch of them

720
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,279
get yourself a bucket of extra-large

721
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,019
black gloves they're awesome that's it

722
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,490
that's how we do it anyway let's get

723
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,559
back on track here I'm high as giraffe

724
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,000
[ __ ] today so you can white Rimmer you

725
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,319
could drive em obviously wet trim you

726
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,880
cut it down you start trimming now while

727
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,559
it's wet it's super sticky it's kind of

728
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,150
a pain in the ass but once you're done

729
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,649
trimming it's over there's nothing left

730
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,330
to do you can get it all handled at one

731
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,650
time you gotta let it hang there and dry

732
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:38,899
and then you got to cure it that's all

733
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,850
that's gonna have to happen dry trim you

734
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,440
can cut the plant down let it hang

735
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:43,669
upside down until it's dry and then you

736
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,769
can trim it like that you still need

737
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,690
gloves but it's not as sticky it's not

738
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,309
as funky you could just wear gloves I

739
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,600
like to kind of grab the buds and get in

740
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:52,309
there with my finger at my thumb nails

741
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,719
you want a glove so it's not really a

742
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,039
thumb nail bits like your thumb tip and

743
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,460
you can just knock the leaves off with

744
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,889
your thumb and you can go super fast so

745
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,240
the thing when you're wet trimming I

746
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,190
like wet trimming because you can get in

747
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,960
there and really cut off everything and

748
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,700
then when it dries the bud shrinks up

749
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,819
and you can't see any leaf in there at

750
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,980
all some bud textures it's a lot and

751
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:15,230
it's very advantageous to trim it while

752
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,789
the buds wet a lot of stuff my stuff

753
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,860
that like the Grateful dog the Capleton

754
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,750
the Capleton I'm holding right now this

755
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:23,479
is really dense and it's not super leafy

756
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,390
so I like to dry trim this so I cut down

757
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,099
the plant so I flush it of course I take

758
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,110
off all the big leaves I cut it down I

759
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,629
let it hang upside down for four I'm in

760
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:34,849
Colorado it's dry here I hang it upside

761
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,530
down until the sticks snapped like grab

762
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:40,069
a stem and bend it and you want it to go

763
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:42,079
crunch that's when it's ready then I

764
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:45,139
take that plant I cut all the buds off

765
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,480
of the sticks into like a bucket it's a

766
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,190
like a big dish I just cut all the buds

767
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,870
off the sticks into that dish and then I

768
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,480
throw all the sticks away the sticks are

769
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:55,849
gone now I've got a bucket or a bowl of

770
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,789
nice buds with little leaves on it then

771
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:01,009
I go through and I cut off all of the

772
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,289
like the sugar leaves I keep all of that

773
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:04,849
sugar leaf and I make hash out of all of

774
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,230
that anything that's got a little bit of

775
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:08,359
trichome on it goes into another

776
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,160
container and it dries out real fine and

777
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,289
that gets turned into hash and that is

778
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,390
my cheap get crazy take giant dad's and

779
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,220
waste a bunch of dabs hash when my

780
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,690
friends come over when I spoke with a

781
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,220
bunch of people that's the you can take

782
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,140
as big of a dad as you want because this

783
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,960
is just trim run

784
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,600
that's that's what happens with that so

785
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,910
I'd find trim once I knock off all that

786
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,319
big stuff I find trim the bud which so

787
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,880
I've got this little butter Capleton all

788
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,710
the big stuffs have basically been taken

789
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,260
off you can see the bud shape there

790
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,880
these little tiny tiny buds sticking out

791
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:39,119
and I'm honestly just knocking them off

792
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,380
with my thumbnail you can almost hear it

793
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,939
that that was excessive that was my

794
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,380
thumb hitting the microphone after it

795
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,269
knocked it off but you can I'm just

796
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,160
basically rubbing this bud and brushing

797
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:50,319
off most of these little leaves cuz it's

798
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,360
dry enough but it's not super crusty and

799
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,298
those leaves are coming right off it's

800
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,829
really easy to knock excuse me for the

801
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:58,359
clutter for the clogged up throat you

802
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:00,220
guys that's from the dude gross Cup in

803
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,199
like a billion dabs but it's real easy

804
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,910
just to knock those leaves off there's

805
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,558
no reason to leave that stuff on there

806
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,960
there are two things that really drive

807
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:09,548
me crazy ah and you're gonna laugh when

808
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,990
I say the words but when I explain them

809
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:12,940
he will completely understand one thing

810
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,890
that drives me [ __ ] nuts is something

811
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,048
called crow's feet those little tiny

812
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,540
tiny leaves that are sticking out like

813
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:21,009
there's a part where this one bud meets

814
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:22,389
another part of the bud and there's a

815
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:23,740
little leaf just sticking out of there

816
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,360
that right now I'm just gonna pull it

817
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,069
off with my fingers if you leave that on

818
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,990
there that's called the crows foot it's

819
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,639
just a little pokey you know it's a V to

820
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,470
leaves a stick off like a V it's ugly a

821
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,910
[ __ ] when you got a pound of weed with a

822
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,319
bunch of crows feet in it it makes it

823
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,600
look ugly if you take out all those

824
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,269
crow's feet that pound away it looks way

825
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,159
better just clean that [ __ ] up I hate

826
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,539
that stuff then there's another thing

827
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,890
that is still on this bug because it's

828
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,960
not done being trimmed it's called

829
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,730
handlebars at the bottom of the bud

830
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,250
where the buds been cut off of the stick

831
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,200
there are two little sticks little tiny

832
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,298
tiny stems where a leaf used to be on

833
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,798
each side those are called handlebars if

834
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,029
you if you have a button you hold it

835
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,470
upside down you'll know exactly what I

836
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,069
mean it looks like GI Joe can make a

837
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,509
jetski

838
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,519
out of this little bud and that's where

839
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:04,779
GI Joe would hold on these two little

840
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,639
sticks where there used to be leaves

841
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:08,740
those drive me [ __ ] crazy

842
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,390
get rid of your handlebars get rid of

843
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,519
your crow's feet and it will make your

844
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,259
buds look way better it's not a lot of

845
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,329
effort it's just a little bit of time

846
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,640
slow down get in there take that [ __ ]

847
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:20,230
out bet that was the main difference

848
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,450
between the winning and losing buds that

849
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,548
I saw last night so just trim your [ __ ]

850
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,259
up you should be able to see the shape

851
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:27,730
of the bud don't get excessive and get

852
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:29,440
in there and mash it up so if you're dry

853
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,240
trimming you should be able to rub it

854
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,500
and you'll see exactly the shape of your

855
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,000
bud and if it's not a dense button

856
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,559
you may need to work on having some Celt

857
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,819
products you need to get some airflow in

858
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,129
there and you may need more light or you

859
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,179
may need a better phenotype but when

860
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,620
it's dried trimmed you should be able to

861
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,180
just kind of rub it knock off all those

862
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,889
leaves if it's wet trimmed you don't

863
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,509
need to pull it open too far but pull it

864
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,980
open a little bit and cut those leaves

865
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:50,180
out and when the bud dries it'll shrink

866
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,039
around those leaves and you won't even

867
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,360
see them in there it'll be just fine but

868
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,309
take that stuff out because it's making

869
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,519
your weed look terrible you could have

870
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:00,109
and it also leaves contain chlorophyll

871
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,609
you don't want to smoke chlorophyll it

872
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,899
does not taste good it takes it longer

873
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:04,459
to cure it's funky

874
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,350
we're not here to smoke leaf we're here

875
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,360
to smoke buds we're honestly here to

876
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,189
smoke trichome resin we don't even need

877
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,169
this green part so let's minimize the

878
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,870
green [ __ ] that we're smoking focus on

879
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:19,160
the good part smoke what we want also

880
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:21,619
what drives me crazy ah sticks when

881
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,759
people try to have a gigantic bud this

882
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:24,169
bud that I'm holding in my hand right

883
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,430
now is probably the size of a golf ball

884
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,960
by the time I'm done playing with it

885
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,450
it's gonna be five or six a little tiny

886
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,160
bowl size buds because there's a stick

887
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,610
in the middle of this and nobody wants

888
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,110
to buy or carry around a stick so I'm

889
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:37,549
gonna take you can hear me just breaking

890
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:40,159
off the buds off the stick right now oh

891
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,109
it looks so much better yep so I think

892
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,850
if you instead of trying to give me big

893
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,979
impressive fancy buds give me buds that

894
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,599
are well manicured take them off the

895
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,920
stick take off your crow's feet take off

896
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,789
the handlebars and when you start

897
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,200
looking at your buds when you're

898
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:53,240
trimming you will know what crow's feet

899
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,769
and handlebars are as soon as you see it

900
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,690
and the cabbage leaves at the bottom

901
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:58,129
that's that's part of the handlebars and

902
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,519
crow's feet but that cabbage [ __ ] at the

903
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,560
bottom

904
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,490
take off the cabbage you guys trimmers

905
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,919
will know what I'm talking about right

906
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,200
away it'll dawn on you it's gonna make

907
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,050
mediocre weed look like much better weed

908
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,309
it's gonna upgrade your weed that much

909
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,740
just by trimming putting a little bit of

910
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:13,879
effort into it so also think about

911
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,349
something that's called the rule of

912
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,370
thumb you guys if that butt isn't the

913
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:18,019
size of your thumb

914
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:20,269
why are you trimming it you're wasting

915
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,220
time if you're making hash or if you're

916
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:24,500
making edibles put that into the hash

917
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,019
pile don't spend 10 minutes trimming a

918
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,509
bud that market value would only be

919
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,559
worth 50 cents don't don't don't waste

920
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,789
your time on something that's not

921
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,980
monetarily worth it

922
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:35,839
grab a bigger bud trim it throw the that

923
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,269
other [ __ ] in the hash pile and move on

924
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,129
but I say wear gloves enough times order

925
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:41,750
gloves please because I don't want your

926
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,010
skin flakes no matter what you're doing

927
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,599
with cannabis you should wear gloves if

928
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,549
you're touching a plant you should wear

929
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,209
gloves if you're touching the pot if

930
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,288
you're in the grow

931
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,579
you should probably just put on some

932
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,950
gloves we talked about pesticide

933
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:54,439
contamination just wear gloves in the

934
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,480
grow especially when trimming don't ever

935
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,630
rub your eyes when you're trimming you

936
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,169
guys they'd only take once ok everybody

937
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,520
does it

938
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,630
you'll start trimming and then your eyes

939
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,819
will start itching because there's so

940
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,230
much just the weed smell in the air and

941
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,639
everything is sticky and your eye will

942
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,960
itch just naturally and you're gonna rub

943
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,000
your eye and you're gonna it'll take

944
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,558
about seven seconds before you go ah ha

945
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,579
[ __ ] and you'll know what you just did

946
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,690
and it's gonna burn you gonna have to

947
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,369
quit trimming for a few minutes

948
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,159
everyone's gonna laugh at you we know it

949
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:21,439
sucks you're gonna be ok deal with it

950
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,120
alright you guys that was 30 minutes my

951
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,500

that I had anticipated playing with

959
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,298
didn't show up to play so I had to go

960
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,798
play all by myself and make new friends

961
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:42,019

mind I drove home with a big goofy smile

million dad's but that was partly for

1018

making so many great friends ladies and

1019
