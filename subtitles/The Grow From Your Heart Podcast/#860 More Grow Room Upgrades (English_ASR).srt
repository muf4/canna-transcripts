or three ways to acquire free seeds

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,158
uh the first way to acquire free seeds

34
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,039
is to send me a grow question on the

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,880
growel tab on my website I have a

36

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,159

51

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,440
get freebies uh the third way to get

57
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,120
free seeds is to join the patreon server

58
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,919
that's right if you join the patreon

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,519
server at the right level every month

60

61
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,519

62
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,679
code level you will get a coupon code

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,879
for two packs of free seeds you'll get

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,800
two individual coupon codes each one

65
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,199
available for one pack of seeds just to

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,760
be clear it is two packs for the higher

67
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,000
subscription so that is three ways to

68
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,959
win free seeds now the question was do I

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,959
have to pay for shipping unfortunately

70
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,640
yes I do make you pay for shipping full

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,479
disclosure here you will have to pay the

72
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,079
$10 shipping fee uh but for free seeds

73
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,000
you've already got free seeds 10 bucks

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
in shipping shouldn't kill you uh I'm

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
trying to do you a favor you do me a

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
favor you cover the shipping we should

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,599
both be happy that way so there are

78
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,400
three ways to get those free seeds that

79
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,359
I talk about the first way send me a

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
good grow question and if I read it free

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,720
seeds the second one make a purchase at

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,759
I redirect if it's over $30 free seeds

83
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,799
the Third Way join the patreon server at

84
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,359
the right tier and guess what free seeds

85
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,080
all right we've covered the free seeds

86
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,000
portion of the podcast we've talked

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
about the discounted pricing and

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,959

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,438

93
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,639
while we are flowing if you watched the

94
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:40,680
last episode that I put out that episode

95
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,559
was about upgrading your grow room

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,400
somebody sent me a wonderful question

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,199
about using items that were not grow

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319

99
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,798
them in our grow environments to uh

100
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,199
improve our grow to better our grow uh I

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,079
read a lot of good ideas on the podcast

102
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,158

103

great updates in the YouTube comments so

106
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,360
I don't want to waste a l a lot of time

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,079
these items I'm about to talk about are

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,920
things that we should use or could

109
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,040
possibly or are recommended to use in

110
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,518
our grow spaces that are not

111
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,000
specifically growroom recommended I've

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,399
got a long list and I want to make a

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,918
short podcast so let me keep this rambly

114
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,238

click like And subscribe I'll make that

117
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,240
part short the first thing that we

118
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,839
should have in our grow I don't know why

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,400
I didn't think about this cuz I walk

120
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,959
past mine every day I trip over the

121
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,719
little hose I Stumble over it all the

122
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,120
time it's always in the freaking way cuz

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,639
you always need it and then it needs to

124
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,600
be somewhere else real soon it never has

125
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,478
a real home but what I'm talking about

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,160
is the shop vac dude to have a shop vac

127
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,000
for the grow a wet dry vac a shop vac uh

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,479
that will help you a lot also if you

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,360
spill a lot of water and you don't have

130
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,918
that water Center I talked about get

131
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,560
yourself a good squeegee learn how to

132
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,079
squeegee water into um the little trash

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,519
can that you can flip over and then pick

134
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,719
it up you know what I'm talking about

135
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,240
cuz it may come right next to the

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,560
squeegee learn that technique so a shop

137
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,400
vac and squeegee and a bucket uh those

138
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,959
are things I definitely recommend also a

139
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,719
little small dirt devil or a dustbuster

140
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,319
those little plug-in uh little tiny

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
handheld vacuums you can charge it with

142
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,800
USB comes unplugged go clean the corners

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
of the grow space with that whoever sent

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,120
me that idea very good recommendation I

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,439
like that one a lot also when [ __ ]

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,680
builds up in the corners and you can't

147
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,439
shop back it out air duster that bad

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,439
[ __ ] blow some air into there move it

149
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,959
out of the corner then shop vac it or

150
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,600
sweep it if you can but sometimes I get

151
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,599
it there's plants in the way so that

152
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,120
little air duster that will help you out

153
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,199
got a hair right here my face tickling

154
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,360
me let's keep on moving air duster is a

155
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,720
good idea get the stuff out of the

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,520
corner also you can air dust off a lot

157
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,360
of your fans and blowers that [ __ ] does

158
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,159
need to be cleaned so the air duster

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,879
works great for that then shop fact that

160
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,360
[ __ ] off after you do that where are we

161
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,399
um a really simple idea that often gets

162
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,319
overlooked is using a pot as a riser if

163
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,000
you're plants are a little too short or

164
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,199
if one plant is shorter than the rest

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,600
you can flip another pot upside down

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,439
you've probably probably already got an

167
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,919
extra Nursery pot use that as a riser

168
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,399
for the plants that are too short also

169
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,318
another great recommendation that came

170
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,239
from the YouTube comments is a Big R

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,840
feed trough as a reservoir if you've got

172
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,639
a big batch of plants that you want a

173
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,079
lot of water for you don't want to spend

174
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,160
a lot of money some of those Big R feed

175
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,959
troughs will qualify as a reservoir you

176
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,880
do have to keep them clean if you're

177
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,959
growing on a budget anything will work

178
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,319
that is a great idea and there's

179
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,680
probably a Big R near you most places

180
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,840
have a big r or some sort of farm

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
tractor supply sort of thing uh that's

182
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,079
where you go get those sort of troughs

183
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,159
those the smaller the area the more

184
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,639
likely to have one of those to be honest

185
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,000
with you so if you don't have a grow

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,038
store around you that may be a good idea

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,598
also a journal I don't care if it's a a

188
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,800
paper Journal a digital Journal but I

189
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,199
recommend a way to keep notes I'm

190
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,079
apologizing once again for the throat

191
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,560
clearing I did of course take some dabs

192
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,120
before the podcast here but a journal

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,038
also a thing and a pen to go with the

194
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,360
journal another thing I recommend is a

195
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,918
dry erase board I've got a dry erase

196
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,038
board by my nutrients and I write down

197
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,719
what I fed last time I write down what I

198
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,560
sprayed last time I write on my ideas if

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,800
I think oh I should feed it this and

200
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,720
that plant in the back there's got a

201
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,439
nitrogen deficiency I should spray for

202
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,319
that I write all that down just to have

203
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,680
some sort of thought process because I'm

204
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,160
going to leave the gro I'm going to go

205
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,598
smoke I'm going to go do my normal day

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
I'm going to come back in 12 hours and

207
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,199
go what the [ __ ] was going on in here

208
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,240
having a little map a little note on a

209
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,120
dry erase board that definitely helps

210
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,639
you can buy a decently priced decently

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,918
sized TR a race board a lot of places in

212
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,079
town maybe at that big the same Big R

213
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,359
maybe at Costco uh maybe you got a

214
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,000
Target that's my favorite spot uh if you

215
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,038
got to go to Walmart there's one there

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,158
of course but a dry erase board is a

217
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,719
good idea also some Sharpies maybe you

218
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,879
want to label some [ __ ] you don't want

219
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,599
the label coming off of a Sharpie is

220
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,080
always a good idea um something that I

221
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,360
like are my name is stickers like if

222
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,719
you're going to a meeting you buy those

223
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,319
little tags that says hi my name is and

224
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,360
everyone just went Slim Shady if you're

225
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,520
my age you just said Slim Shady when I

226
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,439
said that but the stickers they say hi

227
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,959
my name is then you can put the name of

228
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,918
your plant on there and slap that on

229
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,239
your plant pot now you know which plant

230
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,439
you've got growing right there those

231
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,439
little tags are affordable very easy to

232
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,918
find a lot of other people will use

233
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,719
white duct tape for that you could write

234
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,038
the plant label on white duct tape slap

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
it on then somebody else recommended

236
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,038
using painters tape so you could just

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,519
peel that tape right off when you're

238
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:27,759
done reuse that pot not have any issues

239
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,038
all of those are quality ideas another

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,720
thing I'm going to recommend is a lot of

241
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,399
us right now it's winter time here in

242
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,879
Colorado when I fill my buckets with

243
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,918
water in some areas it's too cold I need

244
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,559
to put a I put an aquarium heater and

245
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,319
that 5 gallon bucket to heat up the

246
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,359
water to get it to temperature so if

247
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,519
your water is too cold an aquarium

248
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
heater may work if you're buy one of

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,600
those big RS by one of those big uh like

250
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,359
outdoor stores the farm store uh a horse

251
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,278
trough feed heater is basically the same

252
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,759
thing and it will do the same idea for

253
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,039
you it'll keep that water from freezing

254
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,319
from being so cold uh that way the hores

255
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,319
can drink also makes it warm enough for

256
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,440
your plants to be watered where am I I

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,920
see a lot of people recommending

258
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,920
homemade clone machines like a easy

259
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,360
cloner a turbo cloner there are many

260
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,519
ways to make those you can make it out

261
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,560
of a cooler out of a tote out of a

262
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,959
bucket lots of recommendations on how to

263
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,000
do that I'm sure you could find a lot of

264
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,239
ideas online but you can save a lot of

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
money by making your own Easy cloner and

266
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,278
they're awesome you still got to buy the

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
Clone collars if you have an alternative

268
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,759
to the collars send me your

269
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,479
recommendation I have a long list I'm

270
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,399
trying to go fast here you guys multiple

271
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,839
people recommended knee pads uh so knee

272
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,919
pads if you're down on your knees a lot

273
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,399
in the grow knee pads may be the thing

274
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,078
for you I don't get on my knees a lot

275
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,360
because it's hard for me to get back up

276
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:48,159
but knee pads are not for me they may be

277
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,360
for you how about velcro cord organizers

278
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,719
if you buy stuff from AC Infiniti a lot

279
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,759
of times it comes with a little bundle

280
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,278
of cord organizers those things are

281
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,600
awesome if you can get those also if you

282
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,838
don't want to use Excuse me once again

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,839
if you don't want to use the uh vcro

284
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
version they sell little they're

285
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,959
actually paper clips is what they are

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,000
but not the folded bent kind they're the

287
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,719
kind you squeeze them and it's like a

288
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,839
they're for putting legal documents

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
together it's more fancy than a

290
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,920
paperclip like a highgrade paperclip you

291
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,719
squeeze it it folds open you stick your

292
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,479
cords in there let it go and it will

293
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,278
secure all of your cords that is another

294
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,720
wonderful idea um also somebody

295
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,838
recommended condiment bottles like

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,240
little ketchup mustard bottles uh the

297
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,800
little squeezy kind for watering your

298
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,560
small seedlings that is a brilliant idea

299
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,199
I really like that idea that's a great

300
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,518
one uh somebody also recommended using a

301
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,360
dryer sheet to clean your scissors I

302
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,919
haven't tried that but I see visually

303
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,919
and understand how that will work you

304
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,199
got that coarse texture uh with the

305
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,000
dryer sheet stuff in there when you

306
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,879
start rubbing scissors it'll definitely

307
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,958
help remove the sticky the goo the resin

308
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,039
the junk that's a great freaking idea

309
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
also if you put those in your ducks and

310
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,199
your vents in your house it'll make it

311
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,519
smell fresh and the neighbors won't

312
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,480
smell the ganja as much if it's me

313
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,959
they're going to smell it anyway where

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,519
are we we got a a lot of other great

315
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:06,319
stuff to cover here several people

316
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,440
recommended using uh pool pH testing

317
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
strips instead of just a pH meter an

318
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,760
expensive meter they recommend a pool

319
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,439
testing strip uh for a backup that way

320
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,879
we could double check the accuracy of

321
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,320
our pH pen occasionally calibrate that

322
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,879
bad dog but then also once in a while

323
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
pull out the pool strips and see if they

324
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,278
match up because those things will

325
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,680
always be correct the battery can't die

326
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,958
they can't go out of gauge they can't go

327
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,759
out of uh what's it called calibration

328
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,919
they will always be right so use those

329
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,838
little drops to second guess or to

330
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,199
second check double check yourself I'm

331
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,920
going to clear my throat real hard not

332
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,399
going to edit this episode going to move

333
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,639
away from the mic excuse me then we'll

334
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,320
keep

335
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,560
going all right thank you for that

336
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,600
moment a couple people recommended Home

337
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,679
Depot racks or cheap shelfing for clone

338
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,278
uh storage and spaces I really like that

339
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,759
that's kind of what I do uh if you've

340
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,159
got a lot of clones in a commercial

341
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,159
facility you can line them up on those

342
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,958
racks put a light up there put more up

343
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,639
there hang a light from the top lots of

344
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,799
avail avability for space with those

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,159
small racks I'm trying to keep track of

346
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,679
where I am on these notes Here we are

347
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,078
plant ties and pipe cleaners a lot of

348
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,799
people were anti- zip tie when I said to

349
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,599
use zip ties people are like ah zip ties

350
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,719
are bad because you got to cut them off

351
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
uh when I put them there I want them

352
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,399
there semi- permanently I'm not worried

353
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,440
about cutting them off but you're

354
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,639
correct they do have to be cut off later

355
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,760
so people said to use like plant ties

356
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,879
little bread ties twisty ties and I

357
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,439
recommend a long time ago I was buying

358
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,360
those little pipe cleaners and using

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,880
those to tie down plants to just fasten

360
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,240
[ __ ] together they work for a lot of

361
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:37,559
things so anywhere you use a zip tie you

362
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,159
could use a plant Fastener or a pipe

363
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,599
cleaner that's a good idea then one big

364
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,360
recommendation that I can't believe I

365
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
skipped over was a paint sprayer that's

366
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,600
how I apply pesticides in a commercial

367
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,879
environment we bought a gry CO paint

368
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,159
sprayer it was about 400 bucks and I can

369
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,120
spray 100x 100 foot uh grow space in no

370
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,559
time get in there and douse every single

371
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,799
plant individually so a paint sprayer is

372
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,719
a good idea IDE this is a growroom

373
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,679
related device but I recently purchased

374
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,480
the small uh pump sprayer it's not I

375
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,479
thought it was a pump sprayer from AC

376
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,320
Infinity turns out it's electric uh

377
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,159
Boogie yogie yogie but I just push a

378
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,720
little button and my [ __ ] sprayer

379
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,639
sprays my plants for me I've got to

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,800
carry it around but how bougie how fancy

381
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,879
I did not realize it was electric until

382
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,639
I got to me but I got this new sprayer

383
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,879
from AC Infinity also uh probably by the

384
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,680
next episode I will have an announcement

385
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,639
for you with AC Infinity I don't want to

386
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,479
make any promises cuz I don't know how

387
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
long it will take for them to activate

388
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,360
my coupon code but I'm sure you see

389
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,680

00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,240
announcement right there I'll talk more

396
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,078
about it when I am certain that the code

397
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,000
works if it doesn't work be patient I'm

398
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,679
telling you it's a holiday weekend I

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,039
don't know if they've activated the code

400
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,879
yet but it's coming so stay tuned uh big

401
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,399
shout out to my friends at Infinity for

402
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,320
linking up with me uh where were we the

403
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,879
little

404
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,639
sprayer uh the little sprayer was great

405
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,240
the next recommendation I can't believe

406
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,879
I glazed over this in my last episode

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,639
little turkey pans you guys can buy

408
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,639
turkey pans well probably not right now

409
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,360
they're probably sold the [ __ ] out next

410
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,440
week turkey pans will be restocked you

411
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,039
can go get turkey pans they work good

412
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
for trim bins they work good for sorting

413
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,078
seeds and they work really good also for

414
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,040
underneath the pot if you overw waterer

415
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,439
you need a saucer want some more for the

416
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,919
water to go that bad [ __ ] right in a

417
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,480
turkey pan so you it's got multiple uses

418
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,879
once you use it for the drainage don't

419
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,839
trim weed into it again but you can trim

420
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,559
over it you can get seeds out of it very

421
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,800
useful device that cheap turkey pan I

422
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,679
talked a minute ago about the paint

423
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,399
sprayer uh how about a cheap deck

424
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,679
sprayer just a pump sprayer for your

425
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,519
pesticides you can get those on Amazon

426
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,479
you can get at all your Hardware shops

427
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,560
they are affordable I prefer the kind

428
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,159
with a pressure release valve once you

429
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,359
pump it up to get it real nice and tight

430
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,360
to spray uh now you've sprayed what you

431
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,199
need to you need to take off that top

432
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,639
and refill it or dump it out if you

433
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,120
don't have a pressure release when you

434
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,278
twist that [ __ ] off all the pressure

435
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,560
comes out of that one spot uh into your

436
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,958
eye inevitably so find the kind with the

437
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,518
pressure release that's what I highly

438
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,119
recommend I'm doing a lot of things very

439
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,159
highly today uh we got turkey pans on

440
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,360
the list twice I must have really meant

441
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,240
that um this one uh will sound weird at

442
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,800
the beginning but hear me out bro uh I

443
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,680
recommend some panty hose or nylon

444
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,519
stockings over the end of ducting um

445
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,439
that will help you keep out small bugs

446
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,759
it'll help you keep out debris leaves

447
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,000
whatever um I've got a duct that runs to

448
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,919
the outside over that is a piece of

449
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,559
panty hose it's actually about 6 in up

450
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,120
so that uh it doesn't get destroyed

451
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,318
right away but if anything was to go up

452
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,078
or in through that duct hopefully that

453
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,799
panty hose is a little bit of a barrier

454
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,120
it doesn't stop the air flow but it will

455
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,120
stop a spider hopefully maybe maybe

456
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,120
it'll deter a mouse I don't know but

457
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,720
it's a good idea put a little panty hose

458
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,919
on there it'll help you get some dust

459
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,199
knot in the grow space little prevention

460
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,159
will be good for you they do sell

461
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,758
expensive versions of that uh there are

462
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,278
actually carbon filters that can go on

463
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,440
the end of your ducting those are great

464
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,240
as well but I'm trying to tell you non

465
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,240
grow room related things and that is a

466
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,079
very grow room related device um in the

467
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,278
last episode I did mention that uh I

468
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,958
like to use a fire uh alarm a fire

469
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,679
device a smoke detector is the word I'm

470
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,958
[ __ ] stumbling over I like to have

471
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,838
one of those to let me know if there's a

472
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,119
fire but then I said it doesn't hook up

473
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,959
to my phone but then a lot of people

474
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
several people you freaking Tech genius

475
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:36,318
has reminded me that my wise cameras do

476
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,919
have a fire alarm detector that will

477
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:39,278
then notify me it'll say hey this

478
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,198
thing's been [ __ ] beeping something

479
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,559
is beeping it doesn't know exactly but

480
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,799
it will know you can set that in your

481
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,078
settings so go Tinker with your settings

482
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,519
uh your wise cameras will let you know

483
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:49,439
uh let me read the message it said Rost

484
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,720
to Jeff you mentioned phone

485
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,880
notifications for smoke detectors just

486
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,160
to let you know the wise camera has a

487
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,039
setting under sound detection to notify

488
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,919
you of smoke detector noises and it

489
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,719
works pretty good so that's a good

490
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,278
comment thank you I'm glad you mentioned

491
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,679
that I'm going to go Tinker with that

492
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,240
and make sure that works for me the next

493
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,559
thing I'm going to write down or that I

494
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,880
did write down is a mechanic crawler for

495
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,240
moving around heavy things it could be

496
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,559
uh I get the uh the big five gallon

497
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,318
bottle of Ruby from New Millennium and

498
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,599
that bad [ __ ] is heavy bro moving it

499
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:23,038
from one spot to the other with the

500
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,399
shitty handle on there I put that on the

501
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,798
mechanic crawler cart set it on there

502
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,439
push that bad [ __ ] right to where it

503
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,119
needs to be and then also you could put

504
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,960
a big plant on there if you need to move

505
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,319
it it's useful for a lot of things we

506
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,160
call it the skateboard around here

507
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,240
where's the skateboard uh where's the

508
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,400
stick I mean the mechanic crawler the

509
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,240
little four-way roller thing we move a

510
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,798
lot of [ __ ] with that something else we

511
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,400
need a staple gun bro I use a staple gun

512
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,119
for so many things uh if the white panda

513
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
film comes down tac tac tac just put

514
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,558
that bad [ __ ] back up I have made rooms

515
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,558
with the staple gun and Panda film uh it

516
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,200
looks like my bedroom is real fancy it's

517
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,119
ball built with panda film so yeah it's

518
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,000
really not that snazzy Panda film and a

519
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,239
staple gun will get you a long way and a

520
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,038
grow environment what do I mean by Panda

521
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,400
film that white poly film it's black on

522
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,558
one side white on the other that's why

523
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,280
they call it Panda um it's Panda black

524
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,000
and white and it's h you can get it in

525
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,480
different thicknesses like six mil is

526
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,359
probably the most common maybe three or

527
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,880
four you can use it as flooring you can

528
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,079
build walls with it it's really easy to

529
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
wipe down uh that white color is great

530
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,319
for a grow uh Panda film bro they just

531
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,959
got a [ __ ] free ad from me use that

532
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,480
[ __ ] in your grows it's way better than

533
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
myar myar sucks in my opinion we'll talk

534
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,919
more about that in the future uh did I

535
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,839
mention aquarium pumps for mixing teas

536
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,840
and for stirring your hydroponic tank if

537
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,359
you got a hydro tank with nutrients in

538
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,199
there you don't want them sitting still

539
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,759
go to the aquarium store get a fish tank

540
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,360
pump put that [ __ ] in there and point it

541
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,440
sideways it'll stir your [ __ ] Hydro

542
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,439
tank all day long for you there you go

543
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,558
big [ __ ] tips right there um where am

544
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,960
I where am I I missed I lost my spot oh

545
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,639
did I mention a heat and a VPD gun um I

546
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,120
like to use a heat gun to point at my

547
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,200
leaves and see what the leaf surface

548
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,639
temperature is uh not to be a shill but

549
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,558
our friends at AC Infinity cell a leaf

550
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,480
surface temperature and VPD gun that is

551
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,399
a great Christmas gift so go grab one of

552
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,798
those for yourself or your grower loved

553
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,000
one uh somebody else said a generator is

554
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,679
a good idea it's [ __ ] expensive but

555
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,798
yes if you can afford a generator

556
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,480
especially if you live in a low

557
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,599
populated area to be honest with you I

558
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
have a struggle with the word rural but

559
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,639
if you live in a rural area you may want

560
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,600
a generator if you live somewhere that

561
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
runs out of power uh frequently if the

562
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,240
power goes out if you got bad connection

563
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
if the snow comes and it's going to be

564
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,640
Buck cheeks cold a generator will help

565
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,840
out the whole house and help save the

566
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,559
grow space so get a generator somebody

567
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,279
else recommended also a tape measure why

568
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,000
didn't I think of that bro a real tape

569
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,440
measure we're measuring a lot of [ __ ] in

570
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,558
the grow how much Panda film do I need

571
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,320
to cut how far apart of the lights how

572
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,399
far from the canopy to the lights uh are

573
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,038
as much space is in there lots of [ __ ]

574
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,480
very useful with a tape measure my

575
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,440
grandpa said measure so a tape measure U

576
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,120
but get a tape measure a good one um you

577
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,360
can construction guys out there argue in

578
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,719
the comments uh what the good brand is

579
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,959
I'm not a construction dude but I know

580
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,120
we're not supposed to buy Milwaukee so

581
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,798
link us up let us know what to do um

582
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,399
another very important thing to think

583
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,000
about um this is very important I can't

584
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,360
believe I didn't mention this a first

585
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,038
aid kit I don't want [ __ ] to go wrong in

586
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,719
your grow I really don't but I have a

587
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,919
first aid kit what if you cut yourself

588
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,519
what if I don't want I'm not even going

589
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,360
to you know what could go wrong a lot of

590
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,158
[ __ ] could go terrible have a first aid

591
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,558
kit uh Burns scrapes Cuts bruises

592
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,559
ouchies be prepared for all of it

593
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,119
another thing you may want is an eyewash

594
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:38,279
station uh just a squeezy eyewash thing

595
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,479
to get fluid into your eyes and get um

596
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,678
[ __ ] whatever you're spraying I don't

597
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
even know what [ __ ] I was going to

598
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
say a bloom booster but I didn't want to

599
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
go with a specific product but get the

600
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,279
the bloom boosters when you're mixing

601
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,200
and you splashed it get that [ __ ] out of

602
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,599
your eye with a little eye rent station

603
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,240
here's another thing that is just a

604
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,279
random OG piece of advice I have a

605
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,919
friend who lived in a non-legal State

606
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,399
and allegedly he was cultiva ating

607
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,759
cannabis one day he dropped something

608
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,000
and it splashed into into his eyeballs

609
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,640
he was unable to call 911 for help

610
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,720
because he was growing weed in an

611
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,919
illegal environment he basically had to

612
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,120
call Emergency Services to his house to

613
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,960
come help him what he did was he used

614
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,399
Siri I don't want to say what he did

615
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,400
because I've got Siri on my phone I

616
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,640
don't want it to happen he told Siri to

617
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,559
call his wife and Siri called his wife

618
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,120
and he just yelled into the phone babe

619
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,200
come home help me and finally she caught

620
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,038
on cuz she couldn't hear him the phone

621
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,319
was over there he had to yell until she

622
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,200
[ __ ] caught on she came home and

623
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,678
helped him out but have a plan like that

624
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,798
put somebody's name in your phone that

625
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
you can call and trust and have a plan

626
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,720
with them say hey bro I got you in my

627
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
phone as like [ __ ] emergency number

628
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,079
two so that if something goes wrong I

629
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,079
can call you and you can come to my

630
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,000
house maybe leave a key somewhere give

631
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,158
the homie a key maybe I have a backup

632
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,839
key so they don't have to kick in the

633
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,320
[ __ ] door have a strategy I don't

634
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,519
want anything to go wrong but strategy

635
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,879
is thinking about it planning for it now

636
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,038
is way better than going I got PH down

637
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
in my eye what do I do looking for your

638
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,679
phone being [ __ ] blind stumbling over

639
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
just tell Siri to call your friend that

640
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:05,840
you need to help you and Siri will do

641
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,720
that for you and it could save you a

642
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,599
whole lot of headaches um where are we

643
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,480
all right that was a piece of OG advice

644
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,879
my phone really keeps trying to do all

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,720
coffee and let that [ __ ] sit overnight

668
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,798
and then use that as the water for the

669
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,278
next pot of coffee because they could

670
