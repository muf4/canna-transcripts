delay in emails my family and myself

37
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,759
decided it would be a good idea to all

38
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,890

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,030
decision whoever made that decision

41
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,049
they're fired he goes on to say I wanted

42
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,450
to write back and let you know the

43
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,210
suggestions you made seem to have worked

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,250
I brought my pH up to 6.3 and I'm giving

45
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,169
more nutrients thank you so much man I

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,209
live in Ohio and I don't have anyone

47
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,609
around me who grows so the little quick

48
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:44,188
weird questions are quickest answered by

49
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,959
the experienced guys like yourself so

50
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,188
let me go back a little bit this guy

51
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,228
actually sent us an email recently

52
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:50,758
saying that he was having some problems

53
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:52,920
with his plants and I recommended that

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,750
he had just his pH and change his feet a

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,368
little bit it looks like I nailed his

56
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,420
problems and the plants are looking

57
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,920
better so that's great to hear

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,810
thanks for the feedback thanks for the

59
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,250
update the email also goes like this it

60
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,259
says got another question if you have

61
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,299
the time good sir I'm looking to step

62
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,669
into the world of mostly sativas do you

63
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,069
have a recommendation or maybe a genetic

64
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,109
that you would fit that would fit the

65
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,859
mold it would have to be a strain that's

66
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,990
a little forgive

67
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760
since it's my first go at them I've been

68
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,250
drawing for a couple of years but I have

69
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,959
limited myself to mostly indicas because

70
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,639
of gross size restrictions and will be

71
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,219
grown in a 3x3

72
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,019
my question is how tall is your 3x3 I do

73
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,729
how much height do you have how much

74
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,540
ceiling space do you have from the light

75
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,849
ah but sativas do you know when you say

76
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,429
sativas do you mean like a crazy sativa

77
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,379
like a 14 or 16 weeks ateva or do you

78
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,060
just mean like a 9 or 10 or maybe an 11

79
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,340
week sativa there's a couple of factors

80
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,110
in there you can go really long hazy

81
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,240
stuff like a super Silver Haze or a

82
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,560
Neville's haze or something like that if

83
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,260
you want to go really long or if you

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,959
just want 9 or 10 weeks maybe something

85
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,939
like super Lemon Haze isn't as long and

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,159
very much more sativa dominant if you

87
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,109
want something from my lineup I would

88
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,569
recommend either the storm shadow or the

89
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,130
scarlet begonias would be a tall long

90
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,329
flower sativa that would work well for

91
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,189
you but I want to know how tall your

92
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,810
space is because you're gonna have to

93
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,609
think what but this is if you're gonna

94
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,080
grow from seed or clone you decide when

95
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,790
you're gonna flip the flower so you can

96
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,469
grow it to be six inches tall and then

97
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,569
flower it and it will fit in any space

98
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,739
you've got so it will be able to grow in

99
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,629
there you've just got to plan ahead and

100
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,310
know what you've got so if you want like

101
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,739
a ten-week err I'd say go with like

102
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,870
scarlet begonias or storm shadow if

103
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,009
you're looking for a longer ah then

104
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,450
you're gonna want to start looking into

105
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,949
something with the word haze in it the

106
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,229
Haze's are gonna take longer to grow

107
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,579
this would be a really cool option or an

108
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,798
opportunity for you to grow from seed

109
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,330
you can get some seeds that are sativa

110
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,580
dominant and then you can find the one

111
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,870
that grows well for your limited space

112
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,360
and you can find the one that takes

113
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,099
exactly how long you want it to take so

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,830
this is a good opportunity to grow from

115
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,120
seed ah but a good sativa is going to

116
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,680
take you anywhere between ten and

117
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,019
fourteen maybe sixteen weeks depending

118
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,670
on what you decide to get don't cut it

119
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,049
early that's gonna be my advice a lot of

120
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,298
people like to cut down a sativa too

121
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,519
early let it finish it's always better

122
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,599
when things finish if you're gonna veg

123
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,519
for a couple of weeks and then you're

124
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,259
gonna flower for ten to fourteen weeks

125
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,090
why not wait that extra week and let it

126
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,849
get all the way done so don't rush

127
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,409
yourself with a sativa be patient now

128
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,819
for strain recommendations it's hard to

129
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,649
know what you're looking for what your

130
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,089
flavor profile is gonna be how you want

131
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,639
it to grow I know you've got that small

132
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,250
space but if you want something that's

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,589
gonna go like ten or eleven weeks maybe

134
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,300
twelve weeks like nine or ten weeks I'd

135
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,719
say look at the storm shadow maybe ten

136
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,810
week

137
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,570
look at the the scarlet begonias if you

138
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,879
want to go maybe a little longer maybe

139
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,560
you check out brothers Grimm's Cindy 99

140
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,850
or they're nude urban poison that's

141
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,800
coming out that may take you a little

142
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,110
longer 10 11 weeks I've had some durbin

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,579
poison seeds take me 14 weeks and I cut

144
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,009
him down and they were nowhere near done

145
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,899
but they produced buds that were longer

146
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,699
than my arms and I'm a big dude I'm a

147
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,620
tall guy so I've got long monkey arms

148
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,469
and those buds were as long as my arms

149
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,000
um also if you want longer flowering

150
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,830
stuff things with the word haze in it

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,870
are usually going to be sativa heavy

152
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:05,099
that will take a long time super Silver

153
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,840
Haze are Ian's haze Neville's haze a lot

154
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,370
of the hay stuff will take a lot longer

155
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,069
to finish the word haze usually

156
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,990
indicates long finishing so look for

157
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,909
Hayes's I would say go to the hella dank

158
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,650
seed bank and check out some breeders

159
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,630
there and see if anything catches your

160
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,310
eye and look at long flowering sativas

161
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,659
that's a good way to do it to see what

162
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,300
gets your attention this is a great

163
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,250
opportunity to grow from seed because

164
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,689
you'll be able to find the strain you

165
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,668
want then you'll be able to narrow it

166
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,469
down to the phenotype you want and then

167
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,149
you'll have the sativa that grows well

168
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,100
in your environment and does what you

169
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,500
need it to do so I'm gonna keep going

170
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,390
there's more of this email it says I

171
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,750
grow for medical reasons I have bipolar

172
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,099
depression as well as PTSD I was on many

173
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,589
different prescriptions for major

174
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,810
depression anxiety antipsychotics for

175
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,609
sleep and it straight up sucked at times

176
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,780
the side effects were horrible yeah that

177
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,250
sounds like that could be horrible when

178
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,079
you're taking that many prescriptions I

179
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,610
would assume that they would start

180
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,810
battling each other eventually that

181
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,830
you're taking one to do this and the

182
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,329
other one will do this and then they're

183
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,310
gonna mix and do [ __ ] you didn't expect

184
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,159
I could only imagine how terrible that

185
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,959
was the email also goes on to say I did

186
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,120
that vicious circle for a few years then

187
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,389
broke down after 29 years of being

188
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,329
completely anti weed and I tried it I'm

189
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,300
now 31 and after 2 years I'm happy to

190
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:21,810
say I'm on 0 pills and I am straight

191
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,079
cannabis you heard that guys this guy

192
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,780
used to be on ah let's see he's got

193
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,978
bipolar depression and PTSD he was on

194
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,978
different prescriptions for major

195
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,629
anxiety depression and antipsychotics

196
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:34,889
for sleep there's on three different

197
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,810
pills that he mentioned here he doesn't

198
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,848
say what they were but now he's on zero

199
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,780
pills and straight cannabis the next

200
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,468
sentence of his email is the most

201
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:46,388
important part it's

202
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:48,399
we'd saved my life this person went 29

203
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:51,788
years without consuming cannabis and was

204
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,918
having major mental health concerns and

205
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:55,598
issues and now they're consuming

206
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,639
cannabis in the past two years they've

207
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,860
been happy and their pill free their

208
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,319
prescription free cannabis saved this

209
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,870
person's life I'm not sure if they want

210
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,520
their name said I didn't I probably said

211
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,180
their name on the last time I read their

212
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,589
email but hey dude thank you for sharing

213
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,930

214
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,489
open up and let out I am really glad

215
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,199
that you were on Team cannabis now and

216
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,718
I'm really glad that cannabis saved your

217
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,699
life that is amazing so the email keeps

218
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:24,579
going and it just gets better he says I

219
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,680
can now function laughs smile and be

220
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,560
around my wife and three amazing little

221
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,019
boys so you guys this guy eliminated

222
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,810
prescriptions and is treating his mental

223
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:37,269
health with cannabis and it is allowing

224
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,009
him to be happy for two years he said

225
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,468
he's happy people don't say they're

226
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,509
happy and not mean it he's happy he's

227
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:45,610
able to function which is important

228
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,770
sometimes mental health will stop you

229
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,150
from being able to basically function

230
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:51,188
you can't do your daily [ __ ] you just

231
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,658
can't get up you can't put your [ __ ]

232
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,949
shoes on you can't do what needs to be

233
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:56,408
done because you're depressed you're

234
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,639
overwhelmed by these disgusting feelings

235
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,209
that come through your mind you can't

236
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,860
it's hard

237
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,959
unless you've faced it you have no idea

238
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,819
what it's like and this person is

239
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,459
fighting it with cannabis he can

240
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,990
function he can laugh and he can smile

241
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,209
which is beyond functioning that's

242
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,519
enjoyment cannabis is improving the

243
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,528
quality of this man's life and he's able

244
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,240
to be around his wife and three amazing

245
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:18,098
little boys which means cannabis is

246
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,098
improving the lives of five people

247
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,628
probably spiraling out rippling out to

248
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:24,550
more people he's probably improving

249
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,740
grandma's life grandpa's life

250
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,329
everybody's happier because this guy is

251
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,050
consuming cannabis and keeping his

252
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:33,639
mental health in check without taking

253
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,320
damaging prescriptions nasty addictive

254
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,538
prescriptions that are probably causing

255
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,159
more problems than they were helping so

256
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:40,658
this guy has changed his life by using

257
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,819
cannabis and he was kind enough to share

258
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:44,259
this information with us which is a

259
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,180
tremendous story and I appreciate it

260
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,948

261
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,809

00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,189
done for myself thank you again for

263

questions yourself in a very big way is

265

266
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,049
increase in mental health and happiness

267
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:03,059

I've achieved a lot of things

289
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,379
when I started growing and I was able to

290
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,089
produce quality cannabis for myself

291
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,309
without having to go buy it or seek it

292
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,200
out or search for it that was such a

293
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,000
great feeling of self-sufficiency I was

294
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,550
able to provide this product for myself

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,769
without spending too much money then I

296
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:01,049
was able to grow it and start spreading

297
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,419
it out to people who were actually sick

298
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:05,099
I was able to get my hand my medicine

299
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,809
into the hands of people who were

300
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,360
mentally and physically ill and were

301
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:11,429
able to use products that I grew to

302
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,409
improve the quality and comfort level of

303
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:15,899
their life they were able to consume a

304
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:20,069
product that I planted in the dirt and

305
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,870
nourished for 13 14 16 weeks harvested

306
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,480
it dried it and cure it delivered it to

307
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,940
them hung out and smoked it with them

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,220
and watched them change from the time I

309
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,470

00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:01,469
and he watched their face go from angry

328
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,240
to Hung's they grew some good tasty weed

329
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,460
and then he watched their shoulders go

330
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,759
down shoulders start relaxing a little

331
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,440
bit

332
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,578
then he see him sit back in the chair a

333
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,679
little bit no harm

334
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:12,388
uncross the legs on cross and they start

335
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:15,328
relaxing they start feeling better

336
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,889
they're not in pain the symptoms of

337
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:18,539
their illness have kind of subsided long

338
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,548
enough for them to actually enjoy life

339
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,988
and then you're actually I'm actually

340
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:23,039
hanging out with them and spinning a

341
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,778
minute with them so they're getting to

342
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,099
feel physically better they're getting

343
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,438
to feel mentally better and they're

344
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,449
getting some social interaction so that

345
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,469
feeling trust me I know the feeling that

346
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,628
you're talking about you're saying that

347
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,278
drawing was one of the most rewarding

348
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,860
things you've done for yourself I get to

349
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,110
grow cannabis and then watch sick people

350
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,610
feel better so I know what you're

351
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,568
talking about is the short version of

352
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,278
what I'm trying to say I'm sorry I

353
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,678
ramble on for so long about that this is

354
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,678
supposed to be a quickie but I know that

355
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:50,818
feeling and it is tremendous ah and then

356
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,838
he goes on to say thank you for being

357
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,618
kind enough to answer some of my

358
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,600

361
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,889

I would love to hear from you I keep it

397
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,280
quick but I've got one more email that

398
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,889
I'm going to try to get through quickly

399
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,360
here this one ah this one comes from a

400
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,250
longtime listener this one is actually

401
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,169
an old email that I found in the archive

402
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,480
folder I'm trying to catch them all up I

403
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,610
hope you're still listening to the show

404
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,110
this email goes like this hey Jeff I've

405
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,240
been a longtime listener and had dreams

406
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,800
of making it into the industry I moved

407
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,200
out to Cali and eventually landed my

408
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,929
first actual grow job working a newly

409
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,240
started med grow here unfortunately my

410
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:36,769
bosses are very new to the game as well

411
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,889
and in my opinion it looks like they're

412
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,929
making some critical errors they're also

413
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:44,720
very stubborn so I wanted to get some

414
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,399
solid facts and feedback from a pro then

415
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,470
he goes on to say we're running basic

416
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,929
ocean forest soil mix with smart pots

417
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,120
under LEDs they currently have been

418
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:55,609
feeding the flower room every day with

419
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,830
the nutrient mix every time now

420
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,950
shouldn't there be a mix of some fresh

421
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,170
water only waterings - or is this okay

422
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,970
and also they are feeding every plant

423
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:07,279
every day even if the soil is still

424
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,170
moist from yesterday's feeding is there

425
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,879
any additional dangerous to that besides

426
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:13,009
the chance of root rot from not letting

427
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,620
the soil dry ever thanks again for

428
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:18,110
putting out all the info and keep up the

429
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,639
great work alright that there's a lot of

430
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,899
stuff to go on there thank you for other

431
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,429
compliments at the end there you're

432
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,019
welcome for me putting out all the info

433
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,299
and I promise you to keep up all of the

434
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,100
great work as long as I'm able now let's

435
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,019
get into the email and answer a couple

436
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,300
of things longtime listener dude thanks

437
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,620
a lot I appreciate that dreams of making

438
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,409
it into the industry it looks like you

439
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,080
did it you did it so step one complete

440
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,009
now you've noticed some problems your

441
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,110
bosses are new and

442
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:45,169
[ __ ] it up and they're stubborn hey

443
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,940
no surprise all the bosses are [ __ ]

444
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,219
stubborn don't worry that's how it's

445
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,320
gonna be every facility you go to that's

446
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,750
gonna be just get used to that so you

447
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,420
say you're running ocean forest soil

448
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,549
with smart pots under LEDs that works

449
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:01,189
you're currently feeding the flower room

450
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,569
every day with the newt mix every time

451
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,240
now your question is shouldn't there be

452
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,080
a mix of some fresh water feedings or is

453
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,879
this okay

454
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,450
I would think that since you're using

455
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:16,230
ocean forest soil if you are feeding

456
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:18,330
bottled nutrients every day you are

457
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,159
going to run into problems yes you are

458
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,240
going to get salt buildups that is going

459
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:27,509
to be too much if they are using nothing

460
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,340
but organic teas and non bottled

461
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,490
nutrients that may work because the

462
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,660
organics hopefully they cycle quickly

463
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,220
enough and they're not over feeding

464
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:37,379
enough to where it won't burn the plants

465
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,029
and you won't get salt buildups but

466
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,220
that's highly unlikely that's what they

467
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,689
were doing I'm going to assume they're

468
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,889
just mixing up from everything else you

469
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,920
said I'm going to assume they're mixing

470
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:48,269
up some bottled nutrients and you are

471
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,509
correct that is going to eventually

472
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,860
cause ah it's gonna be over nutrients

473
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,439
it's gonna be over fertilized it's gonna

474
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,610
have too much salts in there the pH is

475
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
gonna get off it's gonna start getting

476
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,970
salt binding to the roots the plants are

477
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,139
gonna start locking out the leaves are

478
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,790
gonna start crawling up these are gonna

479
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,220
get dry and crispy it'll look like a

480
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:07,709
cal-mag deficiency it's gonna be in

481
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,850
everything over feeding and the pH will

482
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,120
get [ __ ] up we'll probably be the

483
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,399
first thing that happens so yeah you are

484
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,590
correct there should be a fresh water

485
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,709
feeding in there probably every other

486
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,750
time something like that just to clean

487
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,910
out all that salt you don't want to go

488
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,529
so hard with the nutrients I don't know

489
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,179
what they are feeding they may be

490
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,720
feeding something gentle and it may be

491
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,759
working

492
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,350
this email is old I'm looking at the

493
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,819
date you sent me this let me know how

494
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,420
this worked out that this crop come out

495
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,310
like [ __ ]

496
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,409
then this crop come out okay what have

497
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,519
you done about this I'm curious but I

498
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,980
want to keep reading the email because

499
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,389
we can still help people you say and I

500
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,490
agree there should be some if you're in

501
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,789
cocoa you can do nutrients everytime

502
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,830
cocoa does not hold on to nutrients

503
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:51,870
cocoa has a low cation exchange rate and

504
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,090
the nutrients fall right out of the

505
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,129
cocoa nothing binds into there the soil

506
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,110
will hold on to it it will start coming

507
00:16:56,129 --> 00:17:00,000
alive things will start growing it'll

508
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,480
colonize inside of there you'll create a

509
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,949
little uh it's called a raizo sphere

510
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,599
you'll create a little environment a

511
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,509
little biosphere inside your plant

512
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,799
inside your inside your container shit's

513
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:12,449
gonna start going on in there if you're

514
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,559
feeding a bunch of stuff all the time I

515
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,660
don't know what they're putting in there

516
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,819
but there's life happening and

517
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,930
eventually you'll get too much salt in

518
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,490
there and you'll destroy that life

519
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,860
you'll get a lot of life then you'll

520
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,269
destroy

521
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:23,438
life then everything will walk out

522
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,359
you'll get problems so yeah there should

523
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,670
be a water a water feeding in there

524
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,319
I would recommend that then he also says

525
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,179
they're also feeding the plant every day

526
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,089
even if the soil is moist from

527
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,710
yesterday's feeding that's not a good

528
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:38,019
idea I like to let them dry out

529
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,240
especially in soil I like to get them

530
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:42,009
almost scary dry if you're in soil or

531
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,230
soilless mix and you're in Fox farms so

532
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:46,029
you can let them get really dry they'll

533
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,460
actually perform better if you let them

534
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,599
get dry as the plants go from really wet

535
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,360
to really drive the pH changes

536
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,699
drastically in the root zone and that

537
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,979
makes more nutrients available different

538
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,990
nutrients are available at different PHS

539
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,730
we try to dial it in to a certain range

540
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,679
where everything is available optimally

541
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,569
but some things are better I'm more

542
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,220
available at higher and lower PHS so as

543
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,678
things swing it'll be able to get

544
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,350
different things also it likes that wet

545
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,509
and dry time cannabis just really enjoys

546
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:15,279
that wet and dry time you'll see the

547
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,710
plant cycle better when they get some

548
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,660
time to dry down so watering the plant

549
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,970
everyday even if the soil is still moist

550
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,700
is not a good idea I would let it dry

551
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,370
out why not water it in the morning on

552
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,289
day one let it go all the way until the

553
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:30,579
end of day two maybe you know if it's

554
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,230
still wet when you come in in the

555
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,609
morning wait till you leave before

556
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,750
you're gonna leave to water it again you

557
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:35,889
don't have to water everything in the

558
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,079
morning just because that's the schedule

559
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,559
their plants the plants are the [ __ ]

560
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,839
boss listen to them also is there any

561
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,490
additional dangers to that besides the

562
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,199
chance of root rot from not letting the

563
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,480
soil dry ever yes it will slow your

564
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,429
growth the plants will say what the [ __ ]

565
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,769
it's soggy it's swampy I don't want to

566
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,150
grow in a swampy soggy mess so my roots

567
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,950
aren't gonna grow as quickly as they

568
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,900
should and it's gonna slow down you're

569
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,160
gonna get less harvest weight you're

570
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,390
gonna get less production out of the

571
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,580
plants and you're gonna have too much

572
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,950
moisture in the room all of that water

573
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,659
in the soil is also evaporating into the

574
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,970
air so you're going to increase humidity

575
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,950
you're going to bring fungus gnats

576
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,289
you're just asking for problems with

577
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,539
that much extra moisture let the [ __ ]

578
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,220
dry the roots will grow more quickly the

579
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,589
print the plants will take off you'll

580
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,630
see it let them get to where you're

581
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,459
almost worried about it in soilless mix

582
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,290
it's best to get them to where you're

583
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,579
almost you're like oh these leaves are

584
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,778
starting to go down right when the

585
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:32,298
leaves start to droop water them then

586
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:34,190
it's perfect that's my opinion the email

587
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:36,108
says bye thanks for putting out all this

588
