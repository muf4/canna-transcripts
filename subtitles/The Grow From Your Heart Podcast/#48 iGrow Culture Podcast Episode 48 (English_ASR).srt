00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,240
dish that had a little bit of vho left

152
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:52,370
in the bottom that we didn't feel like

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,470
scraping out and she decided to heat it

154
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,750
up and make brownies in that pan with

155
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,180
the BHO mix in there and she's laughing

156
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,240

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,319
whole outer layer of the brownie was

165
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,750
literally covered in a layer of shatter

166
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,250
almost and it coated inside of the

167
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,079
brownie but it worked itself in

168
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,699
perfectly to where it got us all so far

169
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,709
it made like a it's like a pineapple

170
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,870
upside-down cake layer of hash on the

171
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,459
outside of the brownies it was so it was

172
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,040
tasty but god I was high had to leave

173
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,930
about 30 minutes after I left the irate

174
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,990
I felt my arms drooping and I was like I

175
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,269
gotta go home everybody went to bed it

176
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,930
was fun back in the day that was the

177
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:53,779
only way I could really utilize a pyrex

178
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,889
dish without wasting it so so you said

179
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,539
back in the dam and asked a tech

180
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,839
question now what do you do now um

181
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:04,069
definitely do not blast into a pyrex

182
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,739
dish or use a pyrex dish in our process

183
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:11,269
anymore at all everything's closed loop

184
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,220
and use parchment when we process it to

185
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,719
go through the back of it so there's no

186
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,160
pirate session needed now

187
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,870
nice yeah you guys stopped me a way to

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,340
do it there's no pyrex dish involved in

189
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,410
how I was taught which is kind of neat

190

location there are a lot of large people

224
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,519

227
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,770
in the NBA yeah

228
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,350
you're the only black person around here

229
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,850
well if you go by the college but then a

230
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,889
black a lot of black folk you should

231
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,840
wear your grill to the gym they just go

232
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:06,870
hard just go hard all day you lost your

233
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:12,870
grill on a different shelf for a minute

234
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:15,299
it's in a different pocket Maddy grew my

235
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,830
girl-scout cookies times king Kim grape

236
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,099
stop ROG cross and it looked beautiful

237
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,870
yeah I had two different nose I had four

238
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,250
plants all together but to fiy nose of

239
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:29,070
the same thing and one got huge and the

240
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,370
nodes were really far away totally

241
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,650
different color the smaller plant the

242
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,950
other Fino turned purple at the end of

243
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:41,490
flower but was super frosty the other

244
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,690
one wasn't as frosty though I thought

245
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,100
you did a good job I'm not sure if that

246
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,150
thing is never gonna get to market I

247
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,889
think that might just be something that

248
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,120
the crew around here gets to grow but

249
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:51,120
you did a good job with that so shout

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,190
out to understand show alright so for a

251
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,360
year in review both of you guys are

252
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,680
involved in these questions you can both

253
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,450
have an answer you can take turns

254
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,829
ah what were some of your favorite

255
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,030
strains to grow since we're all growers

256
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,290
in the room and I might answer on some

257
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:06,620
of these questions too and since we'll

258
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,620
do a year in review well let's see I

259
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:11,429
think at the beginning of the year I was

260
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:13,319
still stuck on the whole Girl Scout

261
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,549
cookie thing and I was anything Girl

262
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,680
Scout cookies I was kind of running

263
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:18,379
through and I still currently still have

264
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,359
a lot of different you know just

265
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:24,000
different unique cookie stuff but I

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,180
putted I grew that Yeti og and that kind

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,730
of put me onto the og side of you know

268
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,889
things so now I've been kind of trekking

269
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,450
and trying to find different strains

270
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,069
like I picked up triangle the other day

271
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,459
so that's another good one to have

272
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,870
around um but I'd probably say yetis far

273
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,489
as my favorite plant is a year to grow

274
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,959
Wow that's a huge compliment

275
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,389
yeah not suggesting I was gonna say

276
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,859
that's one Jessie found for what am I

277
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,958
follow up questions was gonna be do you

278
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,970
prefer to grow different stuff for oil

279
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,169
to if you're gonna smoke it for flour do

280
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,310
you grow up for yourself do you grow a

281
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:59,250
different strain and then grow different

282
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,729
for Earl um a lot of times oil is just

283
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,830
depending on

284
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,240
what we have available at the time so

285
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,310
like if we have certain strains that we

286
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,950
know that are better and oil than they

287
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,269
are in flour will make oil and they're

288
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,520
the same like we have Kanna tonic right

289
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,699
now which we're gonna you know split and

290
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,199
do some oil and then some like capsules

291
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,790
so there's a little bit of mix of oh

292
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,050
yeah that's why I feel real high they

293
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,639
also gave me too

294
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,620
two of those hash capsules right before

295
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,460
we started the show and we've done a lot

296
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,379
of yeah I was like how why am I getting

297
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,450
heavy and then you said that so Kanna

298
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,029
tonic is that the super high CBD strain

299
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,150
um it's not a crazy high it's a good

300
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,549
ratio so three two one THC or CBD THC

301
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,139
ratio so it's nice and great medicine

302
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,389
great medicine yeah sure yeah that'll

303
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:45,949
make great medicine for people are you

304
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:47,480
gonna take you to do you have a specific

305
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,430
patient in mind or a type of patient

306
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,259
like an epileptic or someone with us or

307
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:53,269
something I have a couple people have a

308
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:54,679
couple people who are also like cancer

309
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,169
patients that I want to try to get some

310
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,579
clefto and see if you know just it's not

311
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:01,490
gonna hurt to give it a try especially

312
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,290
when it's you know you're fighting

313
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,090
cancer you might as well try all you can

314
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,799
hell yeah I agree that's cool that you

315
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,149
guys help people out you guys came from

316
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,859
North Carolina and set up shop in

317
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,049
Colorado and they give away a lot of

318
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,399
medicine and for people to be able to

319
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,269
move at it from out of state and do that

320
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,620
is really cool because there are a lot

321
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,509
of people that are really stingy with

322
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,129
what they grow we just love to share

323
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,269
with other people and show people what

324
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,259
we do yeah

325
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,029
that's why you guys are so well-known

326
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,340
cuz you share and you're super kind I

327
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,559
think why we moved from North Carolina's

328
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,360
cuz I wanted it and when I lived in

329
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,579
North Carolina I wanted to tell

330
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,379
everybody I grew weed but he was illegal

331
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,060
but I was like yo come look at this room

332
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:42,320
like I'd crack the door open and people

333
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:43,699
be like what there's so many people that

334
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,830
you know like you you do the same thing

335
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,270
so it's like let me see your weed okay

336
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,550
here's my wheat here's my oil you know

337
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,829
it's just you know everything's comin

338
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:54,109
I'd one thing I do wish I do wish the

339
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,509
barter system with pot was a little bit

340
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,500
better because it would take money out

341
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,490
of the equation

342
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,080
yeah if I could just go to the

343
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,259
restaurant and pay for it an eighth I

344
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,259
know

345
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:09,558
you know Maddie what was your some of

346
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:12,058
your favorite [ __ ] to grow this year

347
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:14,009
definitely I don't know who it's from

348
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:16,708
but there was in New York City diesel

349
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:20,249
FINA we had and it tastes like and

350
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:22,469
smells like red wine and we had put it

351
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,850
in this big circle jar all of our

352
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,920
friends including me would just

353
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:31,079
literally stick their faces in it for it

354
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,868
was insane and then the oil from it was

355
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,359
even crazier it just had such a potent

356
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:38,519
flavor it was almost it mix it with

357
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,350
something else to kind of dial it down a

358
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,970
little bit and then definitely at the

359
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,159
end of the year one of my last favorites

360
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,480
is a tangerine haze times the white yeah

361
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,368
I just found out that I have two

362
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,470
packages of that in my little vault and

363
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,178
that [ __ ] is going to be ran well you're

364
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,350
looking at me like well lets you run it

365
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,360
and give me clones at the keeper

366
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,069
unfortunately we were in the middle of a

367
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,769
process where we didn't know what we

368
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:00,360
were doing with our garden or if we were

369
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:02,039
relocating so I decided not to take

370
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,079
clones of it which was a huge mistake

371
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,149
because I had a fee no that was heavier

372
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,878
in the white and had a really good

373
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:14,039
flavor to it the oil of course is

374
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,688
amazing tangerine oil tastes crazy yeah

375
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,759
she gave me a couple dabs of this

376
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,110
tangerine oil so I'll give you I've got

377
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,089
to pack two seeds I'll give you a pack

378
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,860
maybe both of them you run them and you

379
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,660
find that tangerine Fino and you give me

380
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,949
a climate and then that'll be a good

381
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,958
trade I'll take a keeper out of that

382
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,099
[ __ ] okay the nice tangerine flavored

383
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,109
one and then maybe I'll breed to that

384
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,918
tangerine flavored female I'm so glad

385
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,209
you said that because that was

386
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:35,578
definitely one of my favorite strains

387
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:37,258
that's from down with dirt seeds shout

388
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:39,539
out Riley that's a great stream good

389
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,999
selection usually if you breed to the

390
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,678
white it either comes out nothing like

391
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:45,749
you don't get any flavor or you get all

392
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:47,488
that dank and I had yeah like I said I

393
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:50,790
had one Fino that came out a really

394
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:52,649
strong white flavor and the tangerine

395
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:56,129
was still there but it was definitely a

396
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,808
back note to it which was nice whatever

397
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,369
you were giving me dabs of was delicious

398
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,178
for sure I was like y'all got some

399
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:05,879
overdose dabs

400
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:07,738
you're like falesha good dads go away

401
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,239
quickly I've been trying to conserve

402
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,769
what I made and it's hard

403
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,209
I just want to dab the [ __ ] out of my

404
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,990
dad's all day we're gonna take a battery

405
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:18,349
we keep saying the D word so many times

406
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,120
oh gee over here what do you got I've

407
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,009
got a little bit of live that I got from

408
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,959
my good friend Spence a while back it's

409
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,409
the gorilla haze and then I've also got

410
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,208
some some of the shatter that I made

411
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:30,740
that's parchment paper y'all imagine the

412
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,799
size of parchment that it takes to make

413
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:39,470
that sound you guys listeners yeah

414
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:42,559
that's a nice pizza there you go

415
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,730
nicely medicated highly-educated my next

416
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,259
question that I want to talk about for

417
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,610
the year I might mention a couple of

418
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:48,789
strains I don't even want to talk about

419
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,528
my own strains I should but that feels

420
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,778
Dilemma Joey it's your own or something

421
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:55,220
did you grow anything that you there's a

422
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:58,759
few strange you grew this year that you

423
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,129
know that white widow Vince was amazing

424
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,990
little boy I like the punchline emoji is

425
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,120
pretty unique there's some of it over

426
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,409
there in a jar curing still and I took a

427
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,549
bunch of that to the string cheese show

428
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:11,929
so what I would light it the people

429
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:13,849
around me would be like the glue came

430
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,949
around I think everybody's impressed

431
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,730
with what it does yeah I want to grow

432
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,200
that again

433
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,700
I took cuts to grow it again a couple

434
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,140
more times because I definitely want to

435
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,839
put it in a bigger pot to give it more

436
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:26,059
love more training more nitrogen guys if

437
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,640
you grow the gorilla glue feed the [ __ ]

438
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,989
out of that plant early like yeah it's

439
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,639
hungry it wants a little bit of

440
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,778
everything just over feed it if you

441
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,850
think you're gonna [ __ ] it up in week

442
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:36,649
four feed it more just feed it more it

443
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,879
should be okay I'm gonna take a dab

444
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,399
somebody's got to say something so I'll

445
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,559
ask a question what were some of your

446
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,879
biggest growing evolutions and one of my

447
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,559
favorites is lemon Jeffrey the white

448
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,149
widow and the Gorilla Glue I guess will

449
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,979
settle on those and the Yeti of course

450
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,110
what are some of your favorite the

451
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,789
biggest growing evolutions that you guys

452
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,870
made at the garden of Weeden this year

453
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,828
and I kind of know what you're gonna say

454
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,709
and I'm gonna give a shout out to

455
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:59,838
somebody after you do it and I'll know

456
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:03,289

458
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,399
what with you know stuff changing and

459

that you kind of got a change with the

461
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,089
game so now we're kind of instead of

462
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,240
doing a roomful of multiple plants we're

463
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:20,509
doing less plants same space but just

464
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,799
bigger Longer veg plants so we really

465
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,720
get to take care of a lot of you know

466
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,039
get to spend more time with each plant

467
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,610
work on canopy management

468
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,779
you know stuff like that so shout out to

469
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,798
Greenworks

470
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,798
check it out right there on my paper

471
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:43,679
really set up an awesome plan for their

472
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,480
grow and a lot of people are catching on

473
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,890
to what they're doing because with the

474
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,450
plant account now we have to do

475
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:52,590
something better yeah as a breeder it's

476
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,390
scary to see these plank count

477
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,949
limitations coming but luckily I just

478
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,549
teamed up with the spot shout-out to the

479
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,048
spot so let's do some breeding in there

480
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:03,480
so those are those cages pretty much

481
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:06,029
your biggest evolution of growing yeah

482
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,069
we kind of learned you did a lot of T

483
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,660
stuff you advanced your T's I saw the

484
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,548
alfalfa sprouts I saw some [ __ ] like

485
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,808
that happen I did what do we do this

486
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:18,329
year we did the barley straw that has

487
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:21,418
like natural barley straw barley seeds

488
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:25,079
and it grows okay we did a lot of stuff

489
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,700
with uh grow kocchi kocchi like that was

490
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,119
a big hit this year a lot of girl cause

491
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,548
she's big and then just kind of going

492
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:39,298
back a lot of going back to the basics

493
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:40,558
the kavita's yeah I've been talking

494
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:41,849
about the light that Jessie gave me I

495
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,849
might not even be able to run it you

496
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:47,339
guys my grow rooms got like a 7-foot

497
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:48,869
ceiling I grow my plants to usually five

498
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,189
and a half feet tall and I've been told

499
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,739
that you got to keep the plants three

500
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:57,000
feet from those lights you'll burn them

501
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,990
I mean I don't want to say you will burn

502
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,539
them because there's probably cover

503
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,839
strains that could grow closer than

504
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,279
three feet but I just think they it

505
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,859
would definitely stresses a man it's

506
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,960
just too much spectrum and too much just

507
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,298
I mean that those if you've never been

508
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,548

512
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,990

582
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,910
from the Simpsons is that his name they

583
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,259
should name it Nelson cuz it's just like

584
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,450
hits you and just kicks you right in the

585
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,279
dick and laughs it's a great rig but I'm

586
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,880
kind of offended by the way it hit me I

587
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,619
had a look at it a second time

588
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,210
reconsider if I wanted to hit again I

589
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:23,109
wanted to hit it again I will hit it

590
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:27,220
again but yeah I get that I ain't

591
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:29,589
scurred alright so we talked kind of

592
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,610
about growing evolutions I didn't change

593
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,019
too much I'm learning more about

594
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:33,879
breeding and I learned that one of the

595
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,829
methods I tried I overdid it and I don't

596
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,990
need to apply so damn much cuz it [ __ ]

597
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:40,059
up my plants I tried to I make my own

598
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,670
silver thiosulfate and I applied way too

599
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,200
many applications and I learned that if

600
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,670
you overdo it it just pisses the plants

601
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,830
off and you don't get enough pollen and

602
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,600
it sucks so that's what I learned

603
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:51,189
that's my growing evolution who'd you

604
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,480

were long yeah yeah you and her probably

669
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,370
some of the are the two best female

670
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,929
growers that I know I appreciate for

671
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:02,028
sure maybe we can get her on the podcast

672
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,590
one day yeah I've told her she can come

673
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:04,700
I've told her so

674
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,259
people live in Denver and [ __ ] they

675
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,929
don't want to drive down this town a pod

676
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:10,929
cage number one the dangerous city in

677
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,029
because like every day there's just

678
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:26,519
violent crimes right it's just the

679
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:28,619
population around it's just a population

680
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,369
so why don't I mind my own business and

681
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:34,979
I don't have any problems do my own

682
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,899
thing all right so I guess since we're

683
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,980
talking about [ __ ] the town and stuff

684
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,870
that we see here's a great question

685
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,460
after seeing it's been a full year of

686
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,199
legalization like a year and five days

687
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,819
now since we've legalized recreational

688
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,360
adult use cannabis in the state of

689
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,099
Colorado I remember the moment that you

690
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:53,609
could buy a weed at a store in Colorado

691
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:55,429
but like after this full year how do you

692
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:59,009
feel about it and what have you seen

693
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:04,350
difference yes you guys are from a whole

694
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:06,569
other state it's it's legal so they have

695
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:11,159
to regulate it and some of the

696
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:13,500
regulations are shitty yeah but it's

697
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,340
stuff that has to be done if the whole

698
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,589
you know the country wants to use

699
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,199
Colorado or Washington as an example to

700
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:24,659
go legal across the board they're gonna

701
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,100
have to be it's gonna have to be

702
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,140
regulated like if it wants to be

703
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,619
everywhere so eventually like it's gonna

704
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,170
happen

705
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:34,769
it sucks first small people like myself

706
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:36,720
who are small business mom and pop

707
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:39,240
trying to be small business yeah kind of

708
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,029
always remember go to the moment pops

709
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,049
yeah you always find better stuff there

710
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:48,980
and you will the big store for sure yeah

711
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:48,980
check the spot first

712
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,619
all right Maddy what did you notice over

713
00:27:55,589 --> 00:28:03,559
the last year so many people from out of

714
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,559
state are flooding into Colorado yeah

715
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,769
you know what a lot of people are from

716
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:17,970
North Carolina its North Carolina and

717
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:19,349
Texas that have moved here just cuz you

718
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,779
know us it's the only region in North

719
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:23,699
Carolina we are all from yeah

720
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,579
you brought the town of Dixie with you

721
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:31,890
yeah Dixie is empty now like just just

722
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:34,109
dust left only and all of our friends

723
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,730
though learned how to grow amazing weed

724
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,549
this year all of our friends are really

725
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:41,579
caught on quickly and learned a lot from

726
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:44,299
from us and also yourself and Instagram

727
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:48,359
it's not only social network a great

728
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:50,279
media to learn a lot your guyses table

729
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,809
at the should the new and the old house

730
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,700
as part of what started me thinking

731
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,099
about I should do something because I

732
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,600
would go to your place and guys it's

733
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:59,099
Vincent Maddie's old place and the new

734
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,839
place but people would fly from North

735
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,579
Carolina and come visit these guys and

736
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,230
just hang out for the weekend and when I

737
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,029
would show up to come dab them out and

738
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,529
kind of maybe give them some Irish seeds

739
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:10,500
and a t-shirt and some stickers for

740
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:13,529
visiting and maybe a hatpin they would

741
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,630
start asking weed questions and no [ __ ]

742
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:18,149
ten guys came and nine of them asked the

743
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,860
same exact first three questions and I

744
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,570
was like I should just record this

745
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,759
somewhere and play it back at him like

746
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:27,359
here is my answer like an automated weed

747
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,859
service or some [ __ ] but I got good at

748
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,839
talking to people at the table and

749
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,429
talking about growing weed like that and

750
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,980
so your guys's table kind of open this

751
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,980
up a little bit word I know you're here

752
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,990
so that's kind of silly our table is a

753
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,690
hot topic because we're always just

754
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,339
taking dabs and talking about different

755
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,470
growing subjects and there's always so

756
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,730
many different people there it's always

757
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,009
a different conversation there's always

758
00:29:47,730 --> 00:30:01,620
something to learn such a crazy mix of

759
00:29:50,009 --> 00:30:03,509
people black eye dart at that part of

760
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,269
the map and I missed trying to figure

761
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:08,819
out where I was aiming for there's an

762
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:10,889
Asian guy from his Vietnamese dude then

763
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,740
a couple of white dudes couple

764
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:16,110
chihuahuas couple people that I can't

765
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,789
even tell what they are my work ass it's

766
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:20,819
a nice mix of people over there yeah

767
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:23,879
people just flood in when there's legal

768
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:27,000
weed why wouldn't you we come from a

769
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,320
place where you can't have more than a

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,079
gram on you yeah well you get a citation

771
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:36,189
like if it's under 1/8 or half eighth or

772
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,859
something like

773
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,210
but if it's more you have the

774
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:44,199
possibility of going to jail that's

775
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,120
still that's still real in places I'm so

776
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,548
free we're going home at the end of the

777
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:51,908
month and so most nerve-racking because

778
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:53,319
we can't be ourselves there yeah we're

779
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,269
so used to Colorado everything's so

780
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,980
easygoing and free

781
00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:02,829
I'm staying inside yeah yeah that's

782
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,749
smart that's smart here I forget that

783
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:06,428
we're still supposed to people forget

784
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:07,778
that there's an open container law that

785
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,220
applies to cannabis here you're supposed

786
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:11,378
to have your weed in a container that's

787
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,970
sealed up and out of your reach like in

788
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:14,648
it's probably supposed to be in the

789
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,899
trunk honestly I put mine I've got an

790
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:18,278
SUV so my trunk I can reach the trunk in

791
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:22,298
my car I can reach everything I'm

792
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:24,009
[ __ ] 65 and I have an SUV yeah so

793
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,599
know what no matter where I put it so I

794
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,788
put it in the backpack in a container

795
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,788
and my dabs are always out of reach and

796
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:41,408
in the backseat I mean that's how I roll

797
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:43,359
sometimes there may have been card abs I

798
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:45,100
wanted to be a smartass and ask why he

799
00:31:43,359 --> 00:32:08,168
had no what time it was but none of my

800
00:31:45,099 --> 00:32:12,278
jokes are gonna be appropriate oh that's

801
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:13,960
a good good change for the notice that

802
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,878
when everybody got sick everybody got

803
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,379

years there's some stressful

814
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:51,490
my life is hard hard you know what we

815
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,140
didn't see after legalization a whole

816
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,339
bunch of crime all bunch of murder a

817
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,630
whole bunch of rape a whole bunch of

818
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,519
little kids running around smoking

819
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,890

happy yeah yeah cuz yeah what is there

822
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,569
to fight over when it's legal it is it's

823
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,480
like the no-brainer I just don't

824
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:16,148
understand why other states don't follow

825
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,048
hear that Maddie's got a point guys if

826
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:18,808
you're in another state

827
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:20,829
[ __ ] legalize weed there what the hell

828
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:24,308
legalize cannabis around the country

829
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:26,230
would make yeah and have less people in

830
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:28,599
jail for pointless crimes and make some

831
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,099
money off of cannabis taxes because the

832
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,719
state of Colorado makes a [ __ ] ton I

833
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:33,819

878
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,199

before I even make oil and see that's

974

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:35,600
people in Denver specifically because we

984
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,970

987
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,980
opportunity to meet a lot of other

00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:50,719
fellow dabbers even if you're just

989

offered a booth I declined

1000
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,079
I'd rather roam around and do a task

1001
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,220
rock style just take my backpack and do

1002
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,309
what I can

1003
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:23,989
yeah it'll go quickly I'm sure but it's

1004
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:25,429
more fun that way I don't feel tied down

1005
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,529
when I have a booth I can walk around

1006
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:29,829
and go see who I want to and then get

1007
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,720

1010
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,309
don't want to invest into that and be

1011
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,390
tied down I need to have some employees

1012
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,099
that will run the booth the whole time

1013
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:42,949

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,719
I'll think about it we'll see what we

1095
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:04,019
could do just make a new one and then

1096
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,099
add the link to that one in that one I

1097
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:08,070
might have to do it I'm gonna write it

1098
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,599
down new Twitter but tell me what you

1099
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,130
think how should we say that is that

1100
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:20,099
what does that X mean because it's not

1101
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:22,410
math it doesn't mean x times two would

1102
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,239
make the four you know if we've to bone

1103

mean technically could be right me

1106
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,119
personally I just think when it comes

1107
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:34,940
out of my mouth it just does not sound

1108
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,319
right because we're not doing math

1109
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,599

1183
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,318
it I'm cancelling the Instagram for the

1184
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,480
podcast

1185
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,670
there won't be an agriculture podcast

1186
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,869
Instagram but the IRA genetics one will

1187
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:22,249
exist what are you gonna leave it up so

1188
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,759
you can go steal all the pictures or

1189
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:27,618
whatever has the links I'll just start

1190
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,358
posting those pictures to the Huayra

1191
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:30,769
Genetics Instagram and have one feed

1192
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,119
instead of having two feeds I'm trying

1193
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:34,038
to keep up with it's just a lot of [ __ ]

1194
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,838
and then it sounds like a bunch of

1195
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,420
bitching but it is and I'll probably

1196
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,400
cancel the YouTube for the podcast also

1197
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,048
and just keep the and start doing

1198
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,108
something with the IRA genetics YouTube

1199
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:46,639
or something just so much goddamn media

1200
