the show here let's jump into some of

84
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,560
the main topics i do have a couple of

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,920
great emails here in front of me big

86

shout out big thanks to all the people

87
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,359
that message me on patreon thank you for

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
the love

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,480
this one comes from my friend mark and

90
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,719
it says i've got a question for you

91
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,119
after re-veging a flowering clone and

92
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,680
transplanting soon thereafter what week

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
of the vegetation phase are we now in

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
that's a really good question uh let's

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,599
think about that you've got a plant that

96
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,839
went into flour then you re-veged it it

97
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,280
is now re-veging you could cut a clone

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
from that re-veging plant you've got

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,439
that clone going it is now a fresh plant

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
the real question that you are asking is

101
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,840
what week of the vegetation phase are we

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,959
now in honestly technically uh i don't

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,680
really count veg weeks that critically

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,280
um you can decide uh when you took it

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
out of the cloner and put it into a

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,519
container you can say that that is

107
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,639
officially day one of veg if you need a

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,438
real

109
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,559
a real solid day of marking day one of

110
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,560
veg it doesn't really matter uh the time

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
for veg is kind of arbitrary that why

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
are you counting when it's big enough

113
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,359
put it into flower it's great to have a

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
schedule it's great to have a timeline

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
but uh the reason we keep a good track

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
of what day it is in flowers because we

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
want to know how many days we typically

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,319
flower this plant then we will cut it

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,320
down on that schedule for veg it's not

120
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,478
hypercritical to know what day what week

121
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,639
we are in but if you really need a day

122
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
like i said uh so you're gonna cut the

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
clone you're gonna have a re-veging

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,839
plant then you're gonna cut a good shoot

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,079
off of that re-veging plant that'll go

126
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,879
into a clone dome i think when it comes

127
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,120
out of the clone dome into that cup or

128
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,439
that first pot that is what i would call

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
small veg that is the beginning of that

130
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,040
plant that is now the start of what i

131
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
would say is veg and then when it goes

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
into a bigger pot that obviously would

133
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,680
be what maybe not obviously that is what

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,319
i would obviously to myself call large

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,879
veg i do a small veg and a large veg and

136
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,399
then they go into flour from there so

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,719
like i said before it's not

138
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,959
hypercritical to really have a week a

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
timeline like that of veg as long as you

140
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,198
know uh that when it gets this big i

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,038
should flour it that's kind of more what

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
i would pay attention to that that day

143
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,719
of when to start the vegetation phase if

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
you really need that you can invent a

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,520
day that suits your needs i would go

146
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,520
from uh when it goes into the the first

147
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,599
initial cup or pot when it hits soil i

148
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,799
guess or cocoa or hydro however you're

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
doing it when it goes into your main

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,800
system but um there's really no uh hard

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,079
and fast rule on that because

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
you can just veg as long as you want

153
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,519
like i said a moment ago i'm repeating

154
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,279
myself at this time but the reason we

155
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,120
keep good notes in flower of what day

156
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,799
and what week we are in is because we

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,478
know that at the end of week nine or the

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
end of week 10 we can harvest these

159
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,079
plants so that's a little more critical

160
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,918
i do appreciate the enthusiasm that's a

161
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,240
really good question i also appreciate

162
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,079
the continued patreon support

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
i really do thank you for that uh big

164
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,519

big up to my canadian friends it also

203
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,240
goes on to say i know you were saying

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
something about running them in small

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
pots and flipping them quickly to find a

206
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,478
keeper i was just wondering if you could

207
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,399
talk a little more into detail about

208
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,560
that because that is something i would

209
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,879
like to do with all of the regular seeds

210
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,680
i just got thanks for everything bro i

211
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,038
learned so much every time uh thank you

212
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,319
bro thank you for all of the patreon

213
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,079
support you've been throwing down pretty

214
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
good on patreon you've been buying a lot

215
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,560
of beans i think i actually sent you

216
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,319
like a hoodie or something because i

217
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,918
remember seeing your name so big thank

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
you for all that support

219
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,240
let's talk about that

220
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,478
when i am running a new crop let's just

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
say so recently you guys know maybe you

222
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,359
don't know we'll talk about it um if

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,519
you've been following along with the

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
show you know that i just did an outdoor

225
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,598
breeding run we made some seeds in a

226
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,120
greenhouse some of the seeds i made in

227
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,800
that breeding run have never been made

228
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
before so i need to test them i need to

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,639
see what i've produced

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,478
it's unlikely that i've produced a bunch

231
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
of garbage garbage but it is very

232
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,318
possible i may have made

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,919
mutants i may have made intersex plants

234
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,759
i may have made a bunch of hemp i may

235
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,279
have made a bunch of trash i may have

236
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,280
made things that don't fit the program

237
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,038
for what i'm looking for but may be good

238
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,559
for somebody else but still i need to

239
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,759
find out what i've made as the bottom

240
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,280
line here

241
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
so the quickest and most efficient way

242
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
to do that would be to grow a bunch of

243
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,679
small plants why do i want to run these

244
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,439
plants uh in three gallon pots and put

245
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,879
nine of them under a thousand watt light

246
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,639
and waste a bunch of space and waste a

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
bunch of time vegging them when i can

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,839
put them into very small pots i keep

249
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
saying beer cups i buy a bag of 50 solo

250
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
cups from the local store down the

251
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
street and i've got 50 pots to put

252
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
plants in it takes me a minute to stab

253
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,479
holes in them with some scissors because

254
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,158
i do need some drainage but i can get a

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,800
bunch of pots for a very affordable

256
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,879
price 50 beer cups is very affordable uh

257
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,240
then when you're done if the plant isn't

258
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,439
any good you could just toss that whole

259
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
thing you don't feel like you're wasting

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
a pot it doesn't feel like a lot of

261
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
waste it could just come and go or you

262
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,838
can do small pots but i don't really

263
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
need to grow large plants to see what

264
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
i've got so i'll get these plants going

265
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
i'll put a seed i'll germinate a seed

266
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
i'll put that seed into the beer cup or

267
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
into maybe a one gallon pot at the

268
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,039
biggest and then i'll get it going in

269
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,958
there i'll veg it until it is

270
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,319
maybe six inches tall maybe eight inches

271
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,559
tall kind of just depends on what i'm

272
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,640
going for if it is something that i

273
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,799
think i'm going to keep i will veg it

274
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,879
until it is just large enough to get a

275
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,479
clone once that that top node that

276
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,879
center branch creates a big enough shoot

277
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
to get a clone from i'll cut that clone

278
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
as soon as i am confident that that

279
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,639
clone is going to root i will flip my

280
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,800
plants there's no need to get it any

281
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,240
bigger being the breeder i've got plenty

282
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,679
of seeds i just want to see what i've

283
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
created at this point right those seeds

284
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,958
came out of the greenhouse run nobody

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
knows what we've made we need to find

286
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,439
out what they are find out if they're uh

287
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,958
like i said mutants intersex plants uh

288
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
pure trash or maybe they're [ __ ]

289
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,799
magic i've gotta find that out so i just

290
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,399
wanna grow them as quickly as possible

291
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,159
and discover what i've done

292
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
so i'll get them going in a small pot

293
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,719
veg them up

294
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
i don't need the clones because i've got

295
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
a lot more seeds and that's not my goal

296
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
right now anyway so i'll just get them

297
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
growing and then as soon as they're

298
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,240
sometimes i'll do it four inches five

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
inches maybe even just six inches tall

300
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
then i'll flip them into flower when i

301
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,759
was working in a commercial environment

302
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
and i could have basically unlimited

303
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,559
plants i would run i have these little

304
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
trays and those trays can fit 24 cups

305
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,039
per tray and i could fit two of those

306
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,200
trays comfortably under a 600 watt light

307
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,719
so i would do i would start 50 seeds and

308
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,879
then by the time i was done pulling the

309
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
males or whatever i'd have one solid

310
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,278
tray

311
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
usually i'd use the two trays and spread

312
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,639
them out but i'd have one solid tray

313
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
worth of females that i could grow out

314
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,838
and see what i've got to work with and

315
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
that worked really well under that light

316
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,279
so then i would just grow them right and

317
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,278
start taking pictures don't manipulate

318
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,958
them don't do anything to them because i

319
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,240
simply want to see what these plants are

320
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,239
i may grow them under different

321
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,560
conditions different environments i may

322
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,079
top them i may trellis them i may scrog

323
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,159
them out later in the future in

324
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,759
different runs once they make the cut

325
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,600
but right now i don't know what these

326
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,360
plants are i don't want to waste more

327
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,120
than a few weeks more than a few square

328
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
feet more than a few kilowatts more than

329
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,560
a few cups of dirt on plants that i

330
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
don't know if they could be complete

331
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,479
garbage so i'll put them in the cups put

332
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,560
them in a small pot veg them out flip

333
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
them then start taking pictures and a

334
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,199
lot of a lot of notes i just label them

335
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,879
i'll have rows plant a or sometimes i do

336
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
weird [ __ ] like i kind of code it based

337
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,838
on what i'm working with if it was a

338
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
rise i would say a rise f3 number and

339
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
then it would just be numbered down the

340
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,278
row 1 through 12 or 1 through 25 or

341
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,639
whatever and then i would make a lot of

342
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,399
notes a rise number a rise f3 number 22

343
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,639
really looks crazy good keep an eye on

344
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
that number 36 is gonna be a male at a

345
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,919
super tall i could tell try to keep

346
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,078
notes and then react to how they get fed

347
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,759
feed everything exactly the same treat

348
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,439
everything exactly the same and then see

349
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,759
what these plants do

350
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
what am i looking for

351
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,039
i'm looking for

352
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,519
number one thing is problems i don't

353
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,278
want to send out problematic seeds to

354
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,320
customers that's a good way to ruin a

355
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,159
business

356
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,480
ruin friendships that's just shitty to

357
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,000
do i'm all about making quality [ __ ] so

358
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,759
i want to make sure that we're not

359
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,919
finding any problems as the first thing

360
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,078
to look for do they germinate well is my

361
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,000
first thing do they germ well once they

362
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,838
germ how do they react once i put them

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
into dirt do they sprout up do they damp

364
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
off do they have any weird problems then

365
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
we look for

366
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
mutants do they do any weird [ __ ] as

367
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,919
they grow look for growth anomalies uh

368
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
different ploydial features different

369
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,759
leaf shapes different uh what's going to

370
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
happen are they are they limpy are they

371
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,120
wimpy are they wispy is the word i'm

372
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,559
trying to say are they just weak plants

373
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,399
in general do they grow like [ __ ]

374
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,239
crazy what are they going to show me i

375
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
want to find out take a lot of notes and

376
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
a lot of pictures start snapping those

377
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,680
pictures around week three all the way

378
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
up until harvest get a good catalog of

379
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,000
photos of every phenotype that you find

380
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,679
then if you've got a bunch of good stuff

381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
you know you i know i've got good stuff

382
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,519
then i can send it out to you guys now

383
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,679
you want to do this to kind of find your

384
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,759
keepers i would recommend growing them

385
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,759
um maybe in a one gallon pot get them as

386
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,919
big as uh until you can get a clone off

387
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,240
of them like i said cut that clone as

388
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,838
soon as you see that clone take root

389
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
then flip your plants that are in the

390
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
pot then that way you've got a clone

391
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,000
going for backup and you've got a plant

392
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,240
going immediately you can identify the

393
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
males about 10 12 days away you can

394
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,919
identify the males pull the male plants

395
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
out of there unless you're looking for a

396
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,599
male most people are not looking for a

397
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
boy plant pull the dudes out of there

398
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
also go to your clone dome or your

399
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
cloning machine get all the dudes out of

400
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
there as well because you know that

401
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,799
plant number 32 and clone number 32

402
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,159
those are both boys they gotta go now

403
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,319
you're just narrowing it down to the

404
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,000
awesome females now once you get done

405
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
removing all the males and sexing all

406
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
these plants probably by day

407
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,519
14 hopefully by day 17 you've gotten all

408
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
the dudes out of there maybe even

409
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,759
earlier now what we're looking for is

410
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,679
stellar females you've got clones of

411
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,198
everybody so when you start seeing girls

412
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,278
that really stand out maybe there's one

413
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,799
with an amazing growth structure ah

414
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,000
maybe the one that's got the traits

415
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,838
you're looking for i don't know what

416
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,198
you're after but when you see that start

417
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,480
taking notes and be like this one's

418
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,838
gonna finish way earlier plant plant 13

419
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
the one that i thought would be unlucky

420
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
that's supposed to be the unlucky plant

421
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,240
that one's going to finish early make a

422
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,799
note in your notebook over here and hope

423
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,720
that clone number 13 is rooted well

424
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,000
by this time you have got your clones

425
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,680
out of your clone dome your clone

426
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,679
machine however you do it you've got

427
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,919
them into the small cups and they're now

428
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,159
vegging to be your next run so by the

429
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,599
time you finish this first crop over

430
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,519
here these have been up potted and they

431
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
are ready to go you've got another run

432
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,480
to go so you get to grow all the females

433
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,958
one more time uh take clones of your

434
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
favorite two there will probably be two

435
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,479
there'll be one that you really like as

436
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,479
the grower and one that a lot of other

437
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,159
people like is the consumer they don't

438
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,079
realize that that one that they love was

439
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,039
a pain in the ass to grow they want a

440
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,239
bunch of it and you're going to be like

441
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,599
i don't want to grow that [ __ ] again

442
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
because it sucked there's going to be

443
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
one that you really love pick the one

444
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
that you really like so

445
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
let me make sure i cover that because i

446
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
didn't have any notes i kind of just

447
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,639
freestyled back because i think i'm good

448
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,879
at talking about this yeah run them in

449
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
small pots bro just run them small get a

450
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,559
clone as soon as you can i don't know

451
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,319
how good you are at cloning as soon as

452
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,719
you can get a clone off of that plant

453
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,399
snip a clone as soon as you see roots on

454
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,120
that clone and you are confident you've

455
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,799
got a survivor flower those other plants

456
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,560
keep an eye on them pull the boys as

457
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,078
soon as you can get the big plant and

458
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,198
the clone get them out of there

459
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,799
immediately

460
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,958
keep an eye on the females keep a lot of

461
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,879
good notes decide which one you like

462
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,239
treat all of them exactly the same how

463
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,838
are you going to know which one is good

464
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
if you treated one differently than the

465
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,079
other the one that you gave the other

466
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,720
microbes to is going to come out better

467
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,599
so treat them all the same dry them cure

468
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
them harvest them all the same um

469
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
you might want to i don't know this is

470
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,278
up to you sometimes i cut down all of

471
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
the plants at the end of week 10.

472
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,799
sometimes i kind of keep an eye on them

473
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
and i let some go a little bit longer is

474
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,399
that cheating testing or is that doing

475
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,719
what needs to be done to each phenotype

476
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
to maximize its potential that is up to

477
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,160
you at the end either decide do we whack

478
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,159
them all at the end of week nine at the

479
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,639
end of week ten or do you pay attention

480
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,240
to the trichomes that kind of depends on

481
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,000
if you're a commercial grower like in a

482
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
big facility they've got to be done by

483
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,159
the end of week ten hopefully week nine

484
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,278
uh if not they're coming down by week 10

485
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,120
so we've got to cut them and see what

486
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,120
they do at that point uh if you're a

487
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
personal grower they can manage uh they

488
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
can go as long as you want you're in

489
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,758
charge of that time frame maybe let them

490
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,480
go and see what they do if you let them

491
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:10,159
go to week 11. i generally like to let

492
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,000
new [ __ ] go until uh day 70 at least 70

493
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,759
days because you never know maybe at the

494
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,679
end that last week if you cut it down to

495
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,680
day 63 sometimes around day 65 67 plants

496
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,838
really go shebang kaboom and really beef

497
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,319
up so i like to let them go 70 days that

498
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,160
first run that's up to you that is up to

499
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,759
your uh preferences your garden what

500
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,958
you're looking for if you've already

501
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,199
made a determination uh by day 55 that

502
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,559
that is not the plant you want have no

503
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,479
fear to cut it down and get rid of it

504
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,799
early if that's what you want to do or

505
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,959
finish it dry accurate smoking and enjoy

506
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,319
it as usable product but it's only going

507
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,078
to be now

508
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
here's something i've got to mention

509
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,039
these first test runs are not meant to

510
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,519
be

511
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,240
uh big time cash crop pay the bills get

512
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,879
rich runs these are test runs these are

513
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,039
auditions these are selector runs these

514
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,879
are final hunts is what these are we are

515
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,639
looking for the keeper and the pack that

516
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,480
works the best with you i kind of

517
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,240
describe it like this you know that

518
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,519
there's something in that pack of seeds

519
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,279
that is desirable you read the

520
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,798
description on the website and you

521
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
scroll through a bunch of stuff and you

522
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,879
decided on this one thing this is the

523
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,318
pack of seeds that i want so you ordered

524
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,319
that you know there's going to be

525
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,838
something in that pack most of them are

526
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,599
going to be close to what you want now

527
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,918
you've just got to find the one that is

528
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,399
in there that is really good for you

529
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
we've agreed on italian food right most

530
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
of us can agree on italian food or

531
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,359
mexican food but today we're going to go

532
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,558
with italian food we've agreed on

533
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,479
italian food we've gotten to the

534
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,399
restaurant we know we're that far the

535
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
seed pack came you've got the seed pack

536
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
now when you get the phenotypes that is

537
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,919
the menu do you want the marinara do you

538
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
want the alfredo do you want the

539
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,559
eggplant excuse me for the scratchy

540
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,400
throat but we've agreed that we want the

541
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,839
italian food that's the pack of seeds

542
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
that you got now you gotta open up the

543
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,439
menu and see which menu item is perfect

544
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,359
for you and those are gonna be your

545
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,880
phenotypes hopefully uh you get the

546
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,399
dessert just start with dessert bro

547
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
that's the way to do it anyway i hope

548
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
you heard my stomach ramble rumble as i

549
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,798
was rambling about food i was not hungry

550
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
until i said italian food my mouth and

551
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,160
stomach just totally growled into this

552
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,000
microphone that was funny um so i hope i

553
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
explained that well because really run

554
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,119
them quick run them small so that we

555
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,119
don't waste a lot of time space and

556
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,199
energy like i said this is not a cash

557
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,879
crop this is an audition crop

558
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,360
we're trying to find the keeper out of

559
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,679
this pack then the next couple of runs

560
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,599
we're going to establish a relationship

561
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,880
with the keeper in that seed pack we

562
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,519
want to find the perfect plant for us

563
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
i said before pick two because it's it's

564
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,319
all there are always two most of the

565
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,839
time

566
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,918
a lot of the times it's plants number

567
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,240
two and four for me i don't know why it

568
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
works out that way two four and nine are

569
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,599
always the champs if i number them one

570
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,759
through twelve or uh there's a lot of

571
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,079
times twelve seeds in a pack or whatever

572
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,839
i'll do twelve one through one uh two

573
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,519
four and nine are quite often the

574
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,879
[ __ ] champions so you're gonna find

575
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,038
two or three that you like run them

576
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,480
again because you've got those clones uh

577
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,240
make sure you keep cutting clones every

578
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,679
time you put them into flour so you're

579
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,038
going to cut a clone put them into flour

580
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
cut clones put them into flour keep

581
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,640
those clones so you've always got a

582
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,880
mother plant but run them until you find

583
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,720
the one that you really really like then

584
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
that is going to be your production crop

585
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
the one that supplies your medicine pays

586
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,319
your bills whatever your goal is you've

587
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
got to find the perfect one there's work

588
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,119
to be done a lot of people don't realize

589
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,639
or don't want to do that early work to

590
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,000
find the perfect phenotype they think

591
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,080
they're going to jump in and have a cash

592
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,400
crop and have profitable product the

593
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,558
first run that you can do that but

594
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
ideally you would do an audition process

595
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,240
find the first one especially if you're

596
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,240
going to put this keeper outdoors i

597
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,000
would run it indoors uh through the

598
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,599
winter and then have a clone ready in

599
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,599
the springtime to put out there so you

600
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,959
know what's going to do the best

601
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,199
outdoors find the one with the good

602
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,798
structure to hold up from the wind find

603
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,798
the one that puts out a bunch of good

604
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,400
flowers find the one that's not intersex

605
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,160
or a male so you don't put an intersex

606
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
or a male plant outdoors and [ __ ] up the

607
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
whole neighborhood but this is an

608
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,759
audition process and it can happen very

609
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,879
quickly we don't want to waste

610
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,519
lights electricity time space energy

611
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
soil real estate numbers a lot of us are

612
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,720
limited

613
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
on plant count numbers you've noticed

614
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
that my breeding projects have slowed

615
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
down because i am very limited on plant

616
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,159
count numbers here in the state of

617
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,679
colorado uh back in the day for a little

618
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,039
while they let us just [ __ ] put

619
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
plants wherever you could cram them into

620
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,720
the house you could go to the doctor and

621
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,640
say uh my back hurts i need 50 plants

622
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
for my back curtain then you just say my

623
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
arm hurts they'd write you another 30

624
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,440
plants for that they'd write you all

625
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,319
kinds of recommendations and then

626
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
allegedly you have 125 plant count which

627
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,279
i would never go over 100 because that's

628
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
when you get in huge trouble but back in

629
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,599
the day we'd have 99 plants in some

630
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,759
rooms at some houses and now i'm limited

631
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,918
to 12 which most of the time ends up as

632
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,158
11 because i've got a male plant that

633
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,320
after he does his work around day 25 he

634
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
gets cut down so i'm kind of wasting a

635
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,599
[ __ ] plant count with that male plant

636
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,599
i've got an empty space half the time

637
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,599
just because of that anyway my ramble

638
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,439
the point is that numbers are big so you

639
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,678
can cut down plants that you don't need

640
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,480
early and save on numbers because here

641
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,919
in colorado i get my six medical

642
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
cannabis plants because i have a medical

643
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,559
cannabis card and then i get my six i

644
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
don't use plants you're limited to 12

645
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,639
per household per resident per person

646
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,240
basically so that's what i'm allowed to

647
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,759
do that's that's why my breeding is

648
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,159
slowed down you guys used to see me put

649
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,919
out a lot more [ __ ] until they changed

650
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,679
the rules on us and then covet really

651
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,759
slowed me down because i'm not doing the

652
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,679
commercial contracting and consulting

653
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,158
which i was doing a lot of times i would

654
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,759
trade uh commercial consulting for a

655
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
space in your grow i'd be like well i

656
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,960
need to test run a thousand seeds in

657
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,079
here and then i'll come consult for your

658
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,000
grow while that's happening and that

659
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,158
would be a good trade but not doing that

660
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,319
now because kovid kind of put everybody

661
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
on a skeleton crew i am rambling i'm

662
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,798
going to skim this message and make sure

663
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,919
i got it

664
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,000
grow them small because we don't want to

665
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
waste space get a clone flip them

666
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
see if you like it before you grow up

667
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,720
big

668
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
then this will re-loop me around to a

669
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,960
podcast episode i did about outdoor

670
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,759
plants then you won't be that person

671
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,200
putting gigantic plants outdoors that

672
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,879
you find out late in the season that

673
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,519
you've been vegging this nine foot tall

674
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
[ __ ] plant and it's a boy this is a

675
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,960
good way to prevent that sort of stuff

676
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,480
grow them small turn them burn them get

677
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,798
them out of there don't expect that

678
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,880
first crop to be a cash crop uh you will

679
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,158
pay yourself back you'll pay for your

680
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,559
electricity you'll pay for all your

681
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
bills you'll pay for the seeds over time

682
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,839
this is not going to be the last crop

683
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
you'll ever grow this is the first crop

684
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,720
you're going to grow from these seeds

685
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
you're going to build a relationship

686
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,798
then you're going to grow this plant

687
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,399
like a [ __ ] champion find a keeper

688
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,319
then once you've found the keeper pop

689
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,720
another pack of seeds until you've got a

690
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,960
room full of keepers that max out your

691
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,319
mother plant space all right i do have

692
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
one more question here in front of me

693
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,000
this one came from our friend used to be

694
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,839
cool we hear from used to be cool quite

695
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,599
frequently on this podcast big up to my

696
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,119
buddy used to be cool bro you're

697
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,359
messaging us and you're listening to the

698
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,959
show you must still be cool in my

699
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,599
opinion all right let's get right to the

700
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,759
point cause i'm rambling it says uh my

701
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,759
my recent bout with spider mites during

702
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,000
flower and inability to completely get

703
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,798
rid of the devils made me think of this

704
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,440
as a possible remedy i thought your vast

705
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,279
experience you may have heard someone

706
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
trying this and you might know whether

707
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,200
it would work or just be destructive to

708
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,640
the plants he's getting to a point i'm

709
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
the one rambling and stumbling through

710
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
this not our friend used to be cool i

711
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,960
didn't read this very well it says can

712
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,359
spider mites be removed with a shop vac

713
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,038
or other vacuum i thought about trying

714
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,839
it but i was afraid it might remove the

715
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,240
mites along with all of the foliage also

716
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,240
i had one a rise plant which was least

717
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,319
affected of all of the plants thanks for

718
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
any insight you can provide from your

719
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,918
friend used to be cool

720
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,079
my favorite part about that is that the

721
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,520
arize plant didn't get attacked by the

722
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,199
spider mites something in there told

723
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,359
those mites i don't want to go there

724
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,038
arise stood in the corner not getting

725
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,359
eaten up everybody else was getting a

726
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,359
feast big up to a rise all right let's

727
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,199
talk about this a shop vac for spider

728
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,079
mites um

729
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,720
or any other type of vacuum yes you can

730
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,558
use a shop vac for spider mites but

731
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,400
think about um

732
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,079
when you get the shot back running

733
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
there's that exhaust coming out of the

734
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,278
other side right if you don't have

735
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,519
proper filtration are you just shooting

736
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,119
those spider mites down the hall uh we

737
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,599
would use a shop vac in a commercial

738
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,278
grow to just clean up the floor and [ __ ]

739
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,719
and then i could see that exhaust

740
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,919
shooting the leaves and i thought well

741
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
anything that's coming out of that

742
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,440
vacuum is just going down the hall to

743
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,720
all of the other grow rooms right now

744
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,278
you can see the leaves just rustling

745
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,519
from that that uh that exhaust so are

746
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,200
you shooting spider mites just all over

747
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,200
the place now from one section to the

748
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,038
other uh that would be my first thought

749
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
if you've got proper filtration which

750
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,960
it's got to be a small tiny filter a

751
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,759
very tiny micron filter to catch a

752
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,558
spider mite um i don't you can

753
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,879
definitely use it positivity you can use

754
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,319
it to suck off webs

755
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
you can use it to remove the webs i

756
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,359
should have said it that way you can use

757
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,720
the shopvac to remove the spider webs if

758
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,399
your spider mites have gotten out of

759
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,159
control and you've got little little

760
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
tents happening you can get up there and

761
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,600
just put the shop vac or a regular

762
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,919
vacuum right on there suck those webs

763
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,519
right off that will work uh then use a

764
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,278
rubber glove and a paper towel and just

765
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,558
wipe the rest of that [ __ ] off of there

766
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,319
you're going to do some damage to the

767
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,240
trichomes but it's better than having a

768
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,319
bunch of spider mites on there the

769
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,679
question about removing foliage that

770
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,359
just depends on

771
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,400
how hard you've got the flow be turned

772
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,759
up bro

773
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
if that thing's really sucking and

774
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,278
you've got a powerful vacuum with a

775
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,159
smaller hole it may suck off some of the

776
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,839
foliage it may do some leaf damage but

777
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,200
uh that foliage is where the spider

778
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,879
mites are hanging out and living anyway

779
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
so you may be doing uh you may be

780
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
killing two birds with one stone and

781
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,960
doing two jobs at one time you're

782
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,679
defoliating and getting rid of the mites

783
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,600
this is something that i have done with

784
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,919
white flies i had white flies in a grow

785
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,119
tan uh the grow was at a point where i

786
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,200
couldn't treat it with any sprayed

787
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,199
pesticides or anything like that so i

788
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,240
got my normal house vacuum and i put the

789
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,400
long wand attachment on the hose and i

790
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,798
had the shop back on and i had a long

791
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,038
stick and i would just smack the shot of

792
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,639
the plants with the uh the vacuum

793
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,558
attachment and then use a stick to keep

794
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,159
annoying the blood the bugs and as they

795
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,119
flew out i just [ __ ] shot back them

796
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
off the light because they all went

797
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,158
straight to the light just shot vacuum

798
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
right off of there and then as they

799
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
would land i'd just rattle the plants

800
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,599
again and just go shop vacuum or vac

801
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
them up so this will be effective but

802
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,199
keep in mind that they have to go

803
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,759
somewhere if they're not getting caught

804
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,679
in like a sort of a canister or a vacuum

805
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,200
bag or something are they getting shot

806
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,120
out of the back of the vacuum i don't

807
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
know what kind of vac you're using that

808
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,798
is just something i would really think

809
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,038
about it does blow exhaust out of a lot

810
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,038
of vacuums like a lot of shop vacs have

811
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,119
an exhaust on the other end where is it

812
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,599
gonna go but it could be effective the

813
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,119
other part about ruining your plants um

814
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,639
if you got mites that bad get in there

815
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,158
and see what it does bro the vacuum's

816
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
not gonna be much worse than what those

817
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,880
mites are doing

818
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,558
um i think that answers this question um

819
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,200
if you do this

820
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,480
get rid of the uh contents of that

821
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,159
vacuum if it's a a bag a canister uh

822
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,159
maybe take the whole shop back out to

823
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,919
the woods and light that thing on fire

824
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,880
keep in mind that things filled with

825
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,759
[ __ ]

826
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,278
problems uh get rid of it if you can

827
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,919
burn it like seriously if you've got a

828
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,679
fire pit burn that [ __ ] thing because

829
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,559
uh those bugs are gonna scatter wherever

830
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,640
they go that place now has a spider mite

831
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,240
infestation like level 12 because

832
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,278
they're just in a little bag you just

833
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
put them in there they're they're

834
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,079
breeding in there they're partying in

835
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,278
there they're boys and girls in there

836
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,199
and now there are babies in there and

837
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,278
those babies are having babies spider

838
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,038
mites reproduce quite quickly so

839
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,880
whatever you do get rid of that canister

840
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,640
do keep in mind that that vacuum is now

841
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
filled with problems so whatever happens

842
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
to that vacuum the canister the vacuum

843
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,038
bag

844
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,360
make sure you very you are very

845
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,720
responsible and proactive with what you

846
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,479
do with that so we don't spread those

847
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,000
problems to our friends you don't want

848
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,159
to get rid of them in your grow and then

849
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,079
just take them across town to another

850
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
place and cause a problem there or

851
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,319
across the yard across the lawn across

852
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,599
the whatever i don't spread those spider

853
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,359
mites they may just come back if you

854
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,798
just put them in the trash can outside

855
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,959
they'll find their way back to the grove

856
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,000
eventually maybe maybe not today but

857
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
they're going to go to the bushes

858
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,519
outside then to your shoes then right

859
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,678
back into your grow so let's get rid of

860
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,440
them as far as we can i jokingly said

861
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
burn it with fire but if that's an

862
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,558
option

863
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,319
burn it with fire all right i want to

864
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,798
thank you my friend i used to be cool

865
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,398
for a great message um yes be creative

866
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,599
use that shop vac if that is what you've

867
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,759
got to do

868
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,480
but make sure you get rid of all those

869
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:13,278
mites and mite carcasses this also works

870
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,120
great for aphids white flies

871
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,440
fungus gnats you could do this with if

872
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,879
you've got an abundance of bugs and bug

873
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,640
mites bug webs this would work however i

874
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,159
really hope you got to it before it got

875
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,559
to that the important part is that you

876
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,720
learn why it got that bad and learned to

877
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:32,079
never let it get that bad again

878
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,839
you get one one pass at getting it that

879
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,439
destructively bad but next time we're

880
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,278
gonna make fun of you next time you

881
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,558
gotta think about what you're doing

882
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,159
don't let it happen again that's a

883
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,079
scolding from ross to jeff a polite

884
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,240
gentle scolding you get one pass next

885
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,079
time you're doing push-ups in the ivory

886
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,839
army you got to do a big dab and then
