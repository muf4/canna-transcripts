82
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,009
the episodes about determining ripeness

83
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,530

84
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,689

87
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,989
curing your canvas plants then we did an

88
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,449
episode about trimming now it is time to

89
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,939
clean up the grow room and get restarted

90
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:12,179
for the next cycle let's talk a little

91
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,769
bit about after harvest cleaning it

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,950
sounds pretty basic but there are a few

93
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,989
things you may overlook now if you had

94
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,579
bugs or powdery mildew you may want to

95
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,840
step up your cleaning product you may

96
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,480
want to step up your cleaning regimen

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,489
but if you didn't have any bugs or any

98
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,709
issues I think a white bleach and water

99
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,420
solution should work or maybe you might

100
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,330
want to get yourself some flies in and

101
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,189
use 15 to 20 mils of 5n per gallon of

102
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,500
water use that to clean up your whole

103
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,050
grow either way whatever product do you

104
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,019
use let's clean everything let's clean

105
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,300
the walls wipe down every inch of every

106
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,950
wall start at one section at the top and

107
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,480
just work your way down and to the right

108
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,669
and then just keep going until you've

109
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,369
covered every inch of that grow room

110
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,079
also if you can reach scrub the ceiling

111
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,080
if you can't reach find me I can

112
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,940
probably reach if not get a ladder scrub

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,640
the ceiling let's clean it with either

114
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,530
bleach and hot water or flies in and hot

115
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,329
water and just get anything off of there

116
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,739
that may be hiding that we don't want in

117
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,420
that grow room maybe you've got a spider

118
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,039
light up there chilling out maybe you've

119
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,750
got a little bit of powdery mildew Spore

120
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,949
that you don't know about maybe there's

121
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,858
a piece of pollen up there that you

122
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,810
don't know about let's clean everything

123
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,988

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,590

127
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,408
reflectors they're dusty on the inside

128
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,638

129
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:34,379

00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,000
anything that moves air or blows air

147
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,199
look at the air return on your

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,610
dehumidifier that thing's pulling in a

149
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,560
bunch of water and a bunch of air and

150
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,270
then it's blowing air back out does that

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,339
filter need to be changed does that

152
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:23,310
dehumidifier need to be cleaned off is

153
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,348

154
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,418
of your dehumidifier is it gunky does it

155
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:29,278
need to be cleaned is the reservoir that

156
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,399
you're draining your dehumidifier water

157
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:35,158
into starting to develop slime and algae

158
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,019
if so you need to clean that stay on top

159
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:38,759

166
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,658
Xamax in there then it got dusty let's

167
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,549
just stick into the eyes of X it's funky

168
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:59,639
it's gross clean everything wipe it and

169
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,620
dust the tops of everything clean your

170
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,598
hydro tables if you've got tables in the

171
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,338
room clean them if you've got trays and

172
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:06,870
you can take them outside take them

173
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:08,968
outside spray them down with the hose

174
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,889
you've got a power washer they don't

175
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,629
look the power washer if those tables

176
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,038
are real dirty scrub them down with some

177
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,990
Faiz and scrub them down with some

178
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,550
bleach make sure you rinse them out real

179
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,439
good and just get them real clean you

180
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,669
guys the fayette is gonna foam up be

181
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,528
prepared for that you're gonna make foam

182
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,848
with baizen and make sure you clean

183
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:26,038
everything out when you're done using

184
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:28,348
cleaning products clean out your tables

185
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,728
and reservoirs really well if you use a

186
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:31,319
cleaning product

187
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:33,149
rinse the [ __ ] out of those hydro tables

188
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,800
rinse the [ __ ] out of all your tubing

189
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,658
and all of your lines clean that stuff

190
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,669
so that it's not clogged and so there's

191
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:40,110
no algae in there here's something

192
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:43,680
people don't pay enough attention to

193
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,999
clean the floor yes I know we just walk

194
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,269
on the floor all day right

195
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:50,249
sweep it mop it clean it up if you've

196
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:52,649
got some sort of poly film or panda film

197
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:54,389
on the floor some sort of subfloor does

198
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,878
it need to be replaced are there holes

199
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,348
in it has your poly or your Panda film

200
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,150
started stretching and getting holes

201
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:02,490
from the staples you need to duct tape

202
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,068
some spots check that kind of stuff out

203
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,689
clean your floors everything lands on

204
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,360
the floor the floor is gross

205
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,399
clean it up also here's something I

206
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,528
should mention if you've got light

207
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,899
reflectors with glass on them so that

208
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:18,028
they're air-cooled clean that glass take

209
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,740
that glass out wipe that [ __ ] down with

210
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:23,338
some Windex let it dry and put it back

211
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,168
clean the reflector glass also clean all

212
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:27,329
of your air conditioner filters check

213
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,519
them make sure they are clean if you've

214
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,228
got ducting anywhere check your ducting

215
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,728
make sure the ducting isn't bent in any

216
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:34,800
weird places make sure there are no

217
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,778
clogs make sure all of your duct is

218
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,218
secured make sure it's duct taped or

219
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,538
clamp somewhere so that the air you're

220
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:41,550
trying to move away from the grow

221
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,769
doesn't accidentally end up being blown

222
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,569
right where you don't need it if you've

223
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:47,248
got a leak that air is just gonna come

224
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,348
flying out of there you may just be

225
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,699
moving the heat from the light right

226
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:52,709
back into the grill room then your air

227
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,329
conditioner has to work harder and you

228
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,129
can't figure out why the room isn't

229
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:58,050
cooling down and it gets frustrating so

230
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,759
check all of your ducting check your

231
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,430
carbon filter is that carbon filter

232
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,139
still filtering can you smell the herb

233
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,658
outside when you grow did anybody

234
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,610
mention that your harvest stunk really

235
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,709
badly how long have you had that carbon

236
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,689
filter did you write it down you should

237
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,699
know when that carbon filter needs to be

238
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,039
replaced a lot of the brands say they

239
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,110
will last two years I never believe in

240
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,199
that I've never had a carbon filter last

241
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,908
two years also that carbon filter cover

242
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,588
maybe you're gonna leave that filter

243
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:27,718
there for two years and it's got that

244
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,879
little dust cover on it take that ugly

245
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:32,059
thing off throw it in the washer with

246
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,288
some oxy clean and clean that thing

247
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:37,348
nobody wants to see your pictures of

248
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:40,528
your black and gray carbon filter dust

249
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,939
cover that is gross also you guys get in

250
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,408
there and clean out the reservoir if

251
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,620
you've got a reservoir that you make

252
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,689
sure

253
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,159
nutrients in or that you use as part of

254
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,779
your hydro system that you're pumping

255
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,539
your nutrients from right to your plants

256
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,039
clean that reservoir why wouldn't you

257
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,899
want a clean fresh start you don't want

258
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,509
biofilm and funk in there because that's

259
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,009
going directly to your plants also clean

260
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,200
all of the tubing I've already said that

261
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,490
once but clean it all because all that

262
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,360
gunk will end up into your plants

263
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,100
another thing we should remember to

264
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,019
clean is the emitters if you've got a

265
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,730
hydro system with some sprayers or

266
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,039
emitters or sprinklers at the end of a

267
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,629
line make sure you pop those emitters

268
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,389
off and clean them they like to get

269
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:20,220
filled with some gunky funk now is the

270
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:23,069
perfect opportunity to take all those

271
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,839
off and clean them up real well another

272
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,670
really important thing we can do while

273
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,680
we've got the room taken down we can

274
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:31,079
decide if we need to replace any bulbs

275
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,599
how long have your bulbs been in the

276
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,460
grow depending on what type of lighting

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,370
you're using it may be time to swap out

278
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,320
some bulbs when bulbs get old they still

279
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,570
draw the same amount of electricity but

280
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,220
they do not put out the same amount of

281
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,200
light so you're paying for that

282
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,600
electricity and it is not making it to

283
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,640
your plants so check your bulbs and see

284
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,050
if they need to be replaced a good way

285
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,169
to find out if they need to be replaced

286
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,759
is to get a lumen meter a lumen meter

287
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:59,250
will measure how much light is coming

288
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,889
from your bulb if your bulb is putting

289
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,839
out less than 75 or 80 percent of its

290
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,850
maximum output it is time to replace it

291
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,010
now how do you know what the maximum

292
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,259
output of that bulb is the way to find

293
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,419
that out is to buy a brand new bulb put

294
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,250
the bulb in your reflector and turn it

295
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,019
on then you've got to wait a few minutes

296
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,370
and let that bulb get to its maximum

297
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,259
brightness it takes a little while for

298
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,549
the bulbs to heat up and get to the

299
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,259
right spectrum and get all the way

300
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:25,259
bright once it's bright and all the way

301
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,149
heated up go about 12 to 18 inches from

302
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,980
that bulb and measure what the lumens

303
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:30,949
are right there and write it down write

304
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,060
down the date and the amount of lumens

305
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,700
then check it now when you're cleaning

306
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,619
the room go the same distance away with

307
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,750
that lumen meter and see how many lumens

308
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,639
are popping up if you're not satisfied

309
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,559
with the amount of power you're getting

310
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,600
out of that bulb it is time to replace

311
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,189
it if you feel like you're paying for

312
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,019
electricity that it's not making it to

313
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:53,070
your plants it is time to replace your

314
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:55,199
bowl lumen meters may be expensive but a

315
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,540
lot of times the grow shop will let you

316
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,639
borrow one because they know that if you

317
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,980
bulbs are bad you're probably just gonna

318
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,870
come buy more bulbs when you return the

319
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,430
lumen meter so ask him at the gross

320
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,289
store they may have one available that

321
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,939
you can borrow all right guys

322
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:10,828
most of the cleaning stuff should be

323
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,899
fairly obvious clean the [ __ ] out of

324
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:14,489
everything scrub everything if you're

325
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,929
gonna put plants in anything that had a

326
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,329
cleaner in it make sure you get that

327
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:20,578
cleaner out replace the bulbs replace

328
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:22,799
the filters some other things we may not

329
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,778
remember to think about our check and

330
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,758
reset your timers and all of your

331
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,919
programs if you've got your lights on a

332
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,720
certain schedule fix that schedule if

333
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,009
you've got your co2 or your auto

334
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,750
watering on a schedule

335
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,818
make sure you correct that schedule

336
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,860
before you put new plants in here did

337
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:40,919
daylight savings time happen check that

338
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,199
is the timer on the right time is your

339
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,509
timer on the right day a lot of the

340
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:47,068
controllers have a day that you can set

341
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,810
is it Monday Tuesday or Wednesday is

342
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:51,240
that the proper day do you have AM and

343
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,429
PM set properly make sure you check out

344
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,230
all of your controllers before you put

345
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,208
plants in there and you accidentally

346
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,209
flour them way too early

347
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:02,278
also check out all of your co2 controls

348
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:05,068
another thing I like to do at this point

349
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,649
in time is calibrate all of my pens and

350
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:09,328
meters I like to calibrate my pH pen I

351
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,009
like to make sure that my EC meter is

352
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,359
working properly these are all things

353
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,370
that you should check on between

354
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,528
harvests I like to calibrate my meters

355
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,328
about once every two weeks to tell you

356
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,399
the truth probably every 10 days I just

357
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:23,479
like to check on them and make sure that

358
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,519
those things are accurate another thing

359
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,980
you should have a fire extinguisher near

360
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,810
your grow check on that look at the

361
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,819
little gauge on there make sure it's in

362
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:35,729
the green if your fire extinguisher

363
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:37,289
gauge is not in the green either buy a

364
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,940
new one or take it to the fire

365
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,578
department and have it refilled

366
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,680
correctly I really hope you don't have

367
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:45,899
to use that fire extinguisher but if you

368
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,179
need it I really want it to work for you

369
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,480
also check the batteries in your smoke

370
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,879
alarm yes I said smoke alarm your grow

371
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,860
should have a smoke alarm you don't want

372
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,480
to burn down the house because something

373
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,909
went wrong in the grow room and you did

374
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,800
not have a smoke detector and a fire

375
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:03,958
extinguisher so be a responsible grower

376
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,629
make sure that the safety precautions

377
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,068
are in place now since we're checking on

378
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,759
the fire extinguisher and the smoke

379
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:12,009
alarm it is a good time to

380
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,080
check on your respirator are you using a

381
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,850
respirator to apply pesticides

382
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,620
I really hope you're using something to

383
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,360
keep yourself safe if you're using a

384
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,100
respirator now is the time to check

385
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,259
those cartridges how long have they been

386
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,409
on there is it time to replace them is

387
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:28,059
that respirator clean maybe it's time to

388
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,159
watch a google video and learn how to

389
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,869
properly clean and take care of your

390
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,209
respirator that thing is going to save

391
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,519
your life over time take care of that

392
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,650
also it's a good time to replace your

393
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,139
gloves do you need more nitrile gloves

394
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,449
do you need more time X suits now is a

395
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,699
really good time to make a list and go

396
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,009
to the gross store and stock up on those

397
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,900
types of items all right so we've got

398
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,549
the grill room nice and clean we have

399
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,959
checked all of our safety precautions

400
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:55,479
we've refilled all the necessary

401
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,700
supplies now is a good time to do a

402
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,980
quick inventory of your pesticides and

403
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,120
nutrients and any accessories you think

404
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,639
you may need if you're gonna need

405
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,019
pesticides or nutrients start ordering

406
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,789
that stuff now so that when you move

407
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,289
your plants back into the room you have

408
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:10,179
got all the nutrients and all the

409
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:12,579
supplies you need so that you don't miss

410
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,079
a day of the growth cycle so we've got

411
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,460
everything cleaned up we've checked out

412
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,200
all of our safety equipment we've

413
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,970
restocked of our personal protective

414
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,980
equipment we have reordered all of our

415
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,960
nutrients now if we didn't have any

416
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,990
problems with pests or powdery mildew it

417
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,629
is time to start running that room and

418
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,840
get it prepared for the next cycle now

419
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,220
if you did have pests or problems there

420
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,660
are a couple of more steps that we need

421
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,210
to take we need to clean this room

422
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:39,789
thoroughly we need to spray it with some

423
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,650
products we might want to go a little

424
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,969
harder with the bleach water we might

425
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,279
want to go a little harder with some

426
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,430
thysen you might want to get a product

427
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,079
called procure if you had powdery mildew

428
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,439
you're gonna want to spray something to

429
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,330
get rid of the spores in that room if

430
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,130
you had bugs I would recommend spraying

431
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,740
some sort of pesticide through the

432
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,809
entire room just mix up your pesticide

433
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,029
sprayer your pump sprayer if you don't

434
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,629
have one go get one from Lowe's get a

435
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,039
good one

436
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,299
get a deck sprayer that can handle

437
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,980
bleach because you're gonna be putting

438
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,509
some chemicals in here they're not that

439
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,009
expensive you just need one that holds

440
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,730
about a gallon maybe two gallons of

441
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:17,319
water fill it up with water put your

442
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,720
cleaning product in there whether it's

443
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,490
Faiz an whether it's procure whether

444
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,540
it's a bunch of bleach maybe you want to

445
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,120
use granulated sulfur if you had a PM

446
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:28,189
shoo mix that up spray the [ __ ] out of

447
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,620
the entire room this is your best

448
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,940
opportunity to spray everything and

449
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,799
eliminate your problem there are no

450
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,149
plants in there so you can use products

451
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,828
that you wouldn't spray when you've got

452
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,019
plants in there so get in there and

453
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:40,458
clean the [ __ ] out of the room I would

454
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,740
start with the normal cleaning I

455
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,899
recommend it take everything down and

456
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,909
clean it then put it back up then set up

457
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,350
the room and before you put the plants

458
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:51,198
in there go in there with this

459
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,569
extra-hard commando cleaning spray and

460
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,979
go really hard you guys you got to get

461
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,809
all of the bugs out of there

462
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,220
or you're just gonna bring plants in

463
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:59,629
there and they're gonna get bugs or

464
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,579
they're gonna get p.m. and you're gonna

465
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,379
have another struggling harvest and

466
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,838
nobody likes to struggle through a

467
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,458
harvest so now we've taken everything

468
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,019
apart we've cleaned the [ __ ] out of the

469
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:11,299
room we've replaced the bulbs we've

470
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,068
replaced all of our filters we have

471
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,049
calibrated all of our equipment we've

472
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:16,909
got new protective equipment we have

473
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,708
tested our safety equipment we've put

474
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,870
the room back together we've gone in

475
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:23,268
there and done another final spray maybe

476
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,190
we hit it with fyz and maybe we sprayed

477
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,240
procure on everything to try to get rid

478
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,399
of our problems

479
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,919
maybe we just spray bleach water real

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,629
hot bleach water in there maybe we went

481
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,610
in there with some h2o - that would work

482
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,929
really well also but if you use any type

483
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,789
of products like that you guys make sure

484
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,429
you wear personal protective equipment

485
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,349
some goggles and a respirator you don't

486
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:44,208
want to spray bleach you don't want to

487
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,550
spray h2o - you don't want to spray

488
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,869
flies in without some sort of protective

489
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,669
equipment that should all be terrible

490
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,709
for your eyes terrible for your skin

491
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:53,870
please take care of yourself and if

492
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:56,689
you're using a sprayer to spray anything

493
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,810
please use some sort of respiratory

494
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,880
protection please now once the room is

495
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:04,158
put back together here is something I

496
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,078
suggest I would turn on the lights I

497
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,790
would turn on your blowers I would turn

498
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,259
on the fans I would turn on the air

499
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,119
conditioner and I would let everything

500
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:13,308
run for a few minutes and I would stand

501
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,779
in the room and pay attention is there

502
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,158
anything wrong is there anything you

503
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:18,678
could dial in is there anything you

504
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:22,579
could adjust do it while you're in there

505
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,380
then go outside and walk around your

506
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:26,328
grow space if your grove is at your

507
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,829
house just go walk around the house just

508
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,109
go pick up trash around the house or

509
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:32,359
whatever and see if you can identify any

510
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:34,129
light leaks do you see light coming out

511
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,979
of your grow room if you see light

512
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,350
coming out there is light going in

513
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,930
we do not want and cannot have light

514
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,980
leaks in our grow room so walk around

515
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,340
the house walk around the perimeter

516
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,099
identify any possible light leaks also

517
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:50,990
listen do you hear the blowers do you

518
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:53,329
hear the fans do you hear your air

519
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,370
conditioner is anything outside making

520
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:58,039
it obvious that you're running aggro in

521
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,989
that house this is a good time to

522
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,670
discover that we've got light leaks or

523
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,440
that we've got noisy equipment so that

524
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,930
we don't get ourselves in trouble you do

525
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,029
not want to attract law enforcement it

526
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,519
may be legal where you grow it is legal

527
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,509
where I grow I am still stealth because

528
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,240
you know who's worse than law

529
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:16,190
enforcement [ __ ] thieves you don't

530
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,220
want people to know you've got to grow

531
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:23,090
in your house because somebody may come

532
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,579
and take your crop from you that is a

533
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:28,879
real thing keep that in mind you have to

534
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:32,259
be careful even in a legal state keep

535
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,240
your grow stealth so walk around outside

536
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:37,609
look listen smell

537
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,400
pay attention see if anything is going

538
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:42,889
wrong outside once you're sure that

539
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,990
everything is fine outside that's when

540
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,759
you can go back in the grow room turn

541
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,890
off the lights in the grow room and

542
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,440
stand in there for about ten minutes let

543
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,420
your eyes adjust now is the time to find

544
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,180
out if any light is leaking into the

545
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,640
grow now is the time to find out if the

546
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,620
sunshine from outside is coming through

547
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,990
your ducts for your vanity

548
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,819
right into your light reflectors into

549
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,950
your grow room and shining light on your

550
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:08,869
plants during a dark period now is the

551
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,910
time to find that out now the catch to

552
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,289
these last two things you're only gonna

553
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,180
be able to tell if you have a light leak

554
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:16,490
outside if you go walk around the house

555
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,900
and it's dark outside the only way you

556
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,930
can tell if you have a light leak inside

557
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,610
is if it's light outside and you go in

558
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,980
the grow room and you turn off the

559
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:26,629
lights on the inside of the grow room so

560
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,130
you're gonna have to find the time of

561
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,810
day to do that you're gonna have to do

562
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,360
some investigating and some inspecting

563
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,460
but these are very important details to

564
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,439
not overlooked make sure your grow room

565
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,970
is light proof make sure there's not a

566
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,570
lot of noise coming out of there and

567
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:44,180
also find out if you've got too much

568
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,829
aroma and correct it if you do you don't

569
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,230
want to attract attention that you don't

570
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:49,909
need once you've been growing for a

571
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,750
while or if you're somebody who is

572
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,759
looking for

573
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,950
so say myself I've been grown for a long

574
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,048
time when I used to go walk my dog in my

575
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,519
neighborhood I would always discover a

576
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:00,168
new grow I would go a different route

577
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,579
I'd go two blocks that way three blocks

578
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,900
that way I blocked that way and then I'd

579
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:04,609
come back and then the next day I'd just

580
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,830
do a different pattern I would always

581
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:08,599
find a new grow about once a week

582
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:10,460
because I know what I'm looking for

583
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,099
listening for and smelling for I know

584
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,390
the details I know the clues if I hear

585
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:17,509
you're weird blower at 3:00 in the

586
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,250
morning going from your basement window

587
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,288
chances are you got to grow in there if

588
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,970
you've got an air conditioner in your

589
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,279
basement window in the middle of winter

590
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,409
chances are there's a grow in there if

591
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,240
you've got one window by the basement it

592
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,370
has no snow and the rest of the backyard

593
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,679
is snowy there's a grow in there if

594
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:35,509
there's one spot on your roof above one

595
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,460
bedroom that there's no snow on it

596
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:40,220
there's a grow in there there are really

597
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,200
easy signs that give it away so pay

598
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,500
attention you guys because if I can see

599
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,720
it

600
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,909
law enforcement can see it and so can

601
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,579
the thieves so be careful with your grow

602
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:52,039
try to stay stealth even in legal states

603
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,178
there's no reason to brag there's no

604
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:55,849
reason to set bait

605
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,669
all right podcast world I feel like that

606
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,740
is a pretty good clean and reset episode

607
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:02,059
hopefully I mentioned some details that

608
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,069
you would have overlooked hopefully I

609
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,569
rescued you through a couple of pitfalls

610
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:08,990
now you don't have to make those

611
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:10,279
mistakes hopefully everything was well

612
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,480
in your grow and you don't have any

613
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,000
problems hopefully you don't have

614
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,009
anything funky to deal with also now

615
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,779
that the grow is nice and clean let's

616
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,029
[ __ ] keep it clean let's get in there

617
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,009
with a mop and a broom everyday if we

618
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,389
need to and mop and sweep that [ __ ]

619
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:25,038
let's get in there with a shop vac and

620
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,600
suck out you know that [ __ ] in the

621
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,220
corner you've been looking at get the

622
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,319
[ __ ] shop back and back that out it's

623
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,360
not gonna shop back itself that's a

624
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,038
great place for a spider mite to hang

625
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,928
out it's a great place for some aphids

626
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:37,640
to hang out and breed that's a great

627
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:40,220
place for some powdery mildew to start

628
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,020
that is just a vector for problems so

629
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,940
now that you've got it nice and clean

630
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:45,440
don't be lazy get in there and clean it

631
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,900
as often as you can

632
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,538
they say that cleanliness is godliness

633
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,580
and I think that most applies in

634
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,408
kitchens and grow rooms you guys so

635
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,569
clean up that grow room give yourself a

636
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,669
nice clean environment give your plants

637
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,168
a nice healthy start I think your plants

638
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,179
will be more comfortable and I think you

639
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,310
will also notice working in a cleaner

640
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,500
more organized environment will

641
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,200
you happier it'll make you faster and

642
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,670
more productive and [ __ ] now that you're

643
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,110
done cleaning up the grow room why don't

644
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,600
you clean up all your supplies go

645
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,669

646
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,709
pesticides the measuring devices your

647
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,240
cleaning supplies go write down a list

648
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,069
of anything that you can need anything

649
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,039
that you're low on go get yourself

650
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:28,250
organized also get a notebook and start

651
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,079
making detailed notes start documenting

652
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,940
