very very much you probably an expert

123
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:43,540
before I'm no expert who has had a

124
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:45,099
camera for a while I like that I like

125

the modesty there I appreciate that

126
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,629
and I definitely like being corrected on

127
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,219
the show so these are enthusiasts with a

128
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:53,290
lot of experience here that's what we'll

129
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,940
call not an expert so take everything he

130
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,879
has with the grain of salt you guys I'm

131
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,199
just kidding do I trust you and respect

132
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,089
your opinion so that's why I brought you

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,250
here and slop series gonna chime in once

134
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,539
in a while and then we're going to we're

135
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,949
gonna do this episode live you're ready

136
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,120
to have another fat dab session then

137
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,849
we're gonna record an episode featuring

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,250
or a good buddy slop over here so let's

139
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,900
jump into the photography with our good

140
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,879
buddy who is almost an expert in my

141
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:18,519
opinion Joe what we want to do is

142
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,288
improve the listeners photography did I

143
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,689
just say that yeah anyway what we want

144
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:23,979
to do is improve their photography so I

145
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,449
guess the main thing

146
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,939
that I'll start with is what you guys

147
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,409
need to do is think about why are you

148
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:32,199
shooting photography what's your point

149
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,030
are you gonna do it for advertising are

150
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,709
you gonna do it for magazine shots or

151
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:37,439
are you simply just trying to be cool on

152
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,219
social media and get a lot of followers

153
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,719
because that's gonna make a huge

154
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,760
difference in a lot of the equipment

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,100
that you need to purchase so that's

156
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,409
pretty much what I came up with and then

157
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,720
I wanted to ask Joe if you could

158
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,850
elaborate on that and then also if he

159
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,130
could help us select a camera for our

160
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,960
purchase and our for our purpose and

161
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,889
possibly that fits our budget does that

162
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,899
make any sense Dee bro

163
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,579
yeah most certainly awesome if you're

164
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:03,489
doing the social media thing stick with

165
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:07,629
your phone you your phone is an amazing

166
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,490
device even born some that's ridiculous

167
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,930
as long as you have the proper lighting

168
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,660

169

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,890
have the camera quality the top of

183
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:50,139
camera quality in all aspects that's

184
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:54,039
definitely the DSLR a digital

185
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,750
single-lens reflex camera nice yeah yeah

186
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,189
that's the way to do it you guys it will

187
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,839
not be a test so you don't have to try

188
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,579
to remember that

189
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:06,429
yes all right don't really know what it

190
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:08,199
means but I know that that's what that's

191
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,879
Joe prove the point right there just

192
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,229
think about what you're shooting for if

193
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,519
you're just trying to be on Instagram if

194
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,840
you're going blogging you don't need to

195
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,459
spend a million dollars on all of your

196
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,839
equipment if you're just trying to shoot

197
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,829
some Instagram pictures if you trying to

198
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,539
be a Twitter guy if you're doing

199
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,909
Facebook you can use your phone all of

200
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,580
the new iPhones the Samsung phones my

201
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,680
iPhone 6 takes amazing pictures all the

202
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,789
new phones you can get really quality

203
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,949
pictures and he said

204
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,040
lighting will get into lighting in just

205
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,529
a minute if you guys want to be you know

206
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,180
I've had a magazine shot and I did not

207
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,728
use the super expensive camera I used a

208
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,139
200

209
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,519
camera for that so it's not all about

210
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,319
the camera a lot of it is about the

211
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,180
settings a lot of it is about the

212
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,218
lighting a lot of it is about learning

213
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,360
where to shoot from and maybe a little

214
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:49,819
bit of editing but we'll get into that

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
more so select the camera that fits your

216
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,330
budget get the best camera you can for

217
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,860
your budget when I first bought my

218
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:56,930
camera I was intimidated

219
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,939
I bought a point-and-shoot camera and I

220
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,400
feel like I almost I didn't waste the

221
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,710
$200 but if I would have put that money

222
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,598
toward my nice DSLR camera in the

223
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,758
beginning I would be further in shooting

224
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,978
I don't be intimidated by a camera with

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,960
a lot of settings most of the new DSLRs

226
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:14,209
I think all of them have an auto setting

227
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,938
and so you can learn through that auto

228
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:19,609
setting most all new cameras are

229
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,770
extremely user friendly manufacturers

230
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,680
know who they're making cameras for they

231
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,508
know what their audiences even if you've

232
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,680
never used if as long as you're

233
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:32,930
technology capable as long as you yea be

234
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,788
technology capable by any camera you

235
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,828
want and you will be able to figure it

236
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:40,129
out if it's not on your own through

237
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:41,509
experimenting YouTube YouTube definitely

238
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,129
yeah YouTube is always a good resource

239
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,600
just type in this camera and then the

240
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,360
question you have about it and it will

241
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,709
pop up 17 videos and watch a couple of

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,449
them and filter out the [ __ ] cuz

243
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,708
every one of those guys is gonna tell

244
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,629
you some weird thing that is unnecessary

245
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:57,229
so just watch three videos and figure

246
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:59,299
out get the median there you go alright

247
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,829

248
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,659
shoot it's like the best camera you can

249

for your purpose if you're gonna go

250
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,870

251
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:07,909
thousand dollar camera don't buy the d30

252
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,509

253
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,698
afford it you know if you want the best

254
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:18,610
pictures on Instagram you will have the

255
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:21,469
best do you want the crispest

256
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,759
the crispiest pictures many times do we

257
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,028
have to say a word to make it a word

258
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,350
around all right so then selected get

259

260
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,879
then learn it and also while you're

261
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,799
shopping there are a couple of

262
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,909
accessories that we talked about this a

263
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,379
little bit before there are definitely

264
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,480
some accessories that we would all

265
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:42,078
recommend while you're shopping get

266
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,509
yourself a tripod yes if you don't get a

267
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:46,669
start interrupt no don't get a cheap

268
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,159
tripod like their tripods out there for

269
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,189
20 and 30 dollars which

270
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,929
work but they're plastic and they

271
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,670
they're soft and they're not meant to

272
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,528
last and are not meant to really be

273
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,549
hauled around and that guy stuff and if

274
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,568
you're not gonna haul it around you're

275
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:00,519
just gonna leave you to one place and

276
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:02,198
take pictures always buy that twenty or

277
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,448
thirty dollar one but the difference

278
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:08,378
between a thirty dollar tripod and a $70

279
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:10,120
tripod is giant it's metal it's very

280
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:12,069
sturdy it's gonna last forever

281
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,500
it will last as many cameras as you

282
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:16,028
could buy I ruined my $30 tripod quite

283
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,948
quickly the height adjustment stripped

284
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:20,019
out so it's not get one height if I want

285
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,849
to move it up I gotta like yank it so

286
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,068
I've got the $70 die next one that they

287
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,319
have it Best Buy dude great investment I

288
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:28,479
agree the tripod will make your pictures

289
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,649
your photos will be not wobbly you'll be

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
able to leave the shutter open a little

291
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,220
bit longer because you're not holding it

292
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,188
in no matter how steady you think you

293
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,600
are you're shaking yes and the way

294
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:39,039
physics works think about like a

295
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,509
flashlight if you turn the flashlight

296
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,740
you make a nice arc with the light

297
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,480
you're doing that with the lens you're

298
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,009
not just wobbling it you're waving the

299
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,870
whole end of the lens because the part

300
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,419
that's shooting is wiggling in a much

301
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,970
yeah that's you're making a cone shape

302
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,318
sorry that's science move on also get

303
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,149
yourself a nice case if you can get a

304
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:57,009
bag a soft bag or a case or something

305
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,539
for the camera do that because you're

306
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,250
gonna want to carry extra lenses you're

307
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,838
gonna want to carry a lens cleaner you

308
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,519
need a little soft cloth to clean off

309
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,970
the lint especially when shooting

310
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,639
cannabis my lens is freakin sticky all

311
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,139
the time it's gonna clean it off I get

312
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,490
too close to the plants or something and

313
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,560
then just you touch it and then

314
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,259
trichomes all over your lens old cotton

315
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:22,239
t-shirts no socks

316
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:25,209
don't use actually a fresh anything you

317
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,528
know don't use like anything soft and I

318
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,138
can tell you what not to use but just

319
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:31,000
it's really okay don't press too hard to

320
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,769
scratch up the lens and I personally

321
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
like to go to the sunglasses store and

322
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,620
get that little rag that they use to

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,938
clean your sunglasses real fiber yes of

324
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,078
microfiber that's what it's called they

325
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:40,539
think that works perfect for Mike

326
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,088
totally alright so don't skimp on the

327
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:46,509
case either cases backpacks you know a

328
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,800
$70 $100 case you know you're putting a

329
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,079
thousand dollar camera and it may be

330
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,969
true and and a thousand dollar lens you

331
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,338
know what's a hundred dollar case if

332
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,699
first is a $50 case that gets thrown at

333
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:04,060
the airport or something I don't know

334
00:11:56,698 --> 00:12:04,599
I'm all about initial investment not too

335
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,250
shabby

336
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,170
especially if you're traveling you know

337
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,490
the best way to not get your camera

338
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:12,250
stolen out of your vehicle when you're

339
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,448
traveling cover it up hang it on your

340
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,649
neck and take pictures with you while

341
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:19,120
you're running around never know what

342
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,169
the craziest [ __ ] happens when you don't

343
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,698
have your camera with you

344
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,990
you can like almost guarantee you're not

345
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,578
gonna get robbed you're not gonna get

346
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:35,049
jacked there won't be a catastrophe if

347
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:35,739
you've got your camera on you that was

348
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:37,448
great

349
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,909
get yourself a good tripod get yourself

350
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:41,620
a good case get some lenses now what

351
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:43,899
kind of lens is for shooting cannabis

352
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,759
photography yeah could you recommend a

353
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,250
few lenses I don't want to give any like

354
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,778
specific lens to get just because

355
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,278
everybody you know I don't want it to be

356
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:54,338
bad and then you say oh this guy said

357
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,899
that I love that but it's are you trying

358
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,850
to take pictures of trichomes or trying

359
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,409
to take pictures of buds off the plant

360
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,360
on the plant you want to take pictures

361
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,980
of the whole plant different lenses are

362
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,589
gonna do different things you can get

363
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,949
you know shorter focal length plants or

364
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:13,449
plants shorter focal length lenses for

365
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:17,558
portraits and that's just really general

366
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:18,849
you can get all different if there's all

367
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:20,769
different kinds of lenses it really

368
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,600
depends on what you want to do and each

369
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,578
camera is gonna have different lenses

370
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,290
he's gonna have different we're just

371
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:27,549
talking about DSLRs right now would that

372
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:33,039
cuz that's the only thing that lenses

373
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:34,719
really applied to your lens and you're

374
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,669
buying your lens in your body separate I

375
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
mean if you're buying them in a box

376
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,889
together it's set you're getting that

377
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,558
for a reason if you're buying we got the

378
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,360
body that you want because that the body

379
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:48,730
has all the features that you want and

380
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,220
then the lens because that lens has all

381
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,629
the features that you want it depends on

382
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,939
what you want to do so when it says body

383
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:57,490
only they're sending me a usable camera

384
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:58,990
with no lens correct okay that's that's

385
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,339
misleading I did not know anything about

386
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,720
that when I was camera shopping was like

387
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,040
what the hell does that mean body only I

388
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,079
wonder if there were mechanics and

389
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,509
there oh yeah it's misleading is that

390
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,948
like just the plastic or is it yeah no I

391
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:11,560
know that there you go guys that was a

392
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,599
good piece of advice um but that said

393
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:17,559
you can certainly get lenses that fit

394
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,480
all applications you can get like the

395
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,919
telephoto lens it's telephoto and

396
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,889
tell'em acro so you like I use just as

397
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:33,068
the easy lens for all aspects I use it I

398
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:36,430
think it's it in 18 to 200 it's it's a

399
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:37,778
huge range it's and that fits anything

400
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,458
that you want you want to take a picture

401
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:43,169
of a mountain you're good you want to

402
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,169
take a picture of a trichome you're good

403
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,740
yeah there you go this is my go-to lens

404
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,750
right here that's what I use quite often

405
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,198
everything that you needed to do yeah

406
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:02,198
without getting too specific okay so

407
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,750
guys what I use since Joe approves of my

408
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,818
set up here I'm using the Nikon d3200

409
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,129
and I bought the package that comes with

410
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:12,610
the case and the two lenses and I

411
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,708
usually use the 55 to 200 lens but when

412
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,089
I want to get in there sometimes it's

413
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,409
hard to maneuver around the grow room if

414
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,480
you can't back up from the plant if

415
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:21,039
you're up close then I'll switch to the

416
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,329
I'm looking at the right number so I

417
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,019
don't mislead anybody here

418
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:27,759
it's the 18 to 55 is the one I use when

419
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,620
I can't maneuver around the room - well

420
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,659
if I'm further away I go for this longer

421
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,328
lens if I'm close in tight I use the 18

422
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:37,028
to 55 I get much better shots with this

423
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:40,409
55 to 200 lens this is my go to right

424
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:43,750
here so when we're saying all of this

425
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:46,659
basically you to take the macro shots on

426
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,019
that 55 to 200 you put it all the way to

427
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:54,458
200 and on a tripod and you're gonna be

428
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:57,370
about 1820 inches away from the nug with

429
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,750
your 200 zoomed all the way out into

430
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,698
that nook and that's how you're getting

431
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,639
your macro shots okay in that specific

432
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:05,889
zoomed all the way out or all the way in

433
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,740
well you're zoomed into what a giant on

434
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,188
the 200 here 200 is extended as far as

435
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,310
it will go

436
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:14,500
you're set it to 200 so the lens is out

437
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,109
super long and on your viewfinder it's

438
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,649
zoomed

439
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,889
in on your subject okay and then that's

440
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,529
where you find your macros setting and

441
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:27,169
that lends nice yeah that's so that's

442
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,419
but that's in these types of lenses that

443
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:33,979
do everything I think I've been off the

444
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:36,649
mic for so much of this but that's so

445
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,899
those are my mics those are lenses that

446
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,840
do everything if you want to take

447
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,600
pictures of just the trichomes you know

448
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,980
really close-up things going on in your

449
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,389
garden you could take you know awesome

450
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,019
pictures of soil who knows what you'll

451
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:53,179
find in there you could take pictures of

452
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,559
whole nugs trichomes that's really what

453
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,839
you're looking for you want to get like

454
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,669
a dedicated macro lens because some

455
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,810
things it won't take pictures of

456
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,699
mountains something that won't take

457
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:04,549
pictures of your family

458
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,360
that's no portraits just little tiny

459
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:09,470
stuff just little things okay yeah get

460
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,509
the right lens for the right jobs

461
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,250
actually do your researcher look for

462
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,660
something that's gonna shoot in five two

463
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,329
one

464
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:22,580
that's all about a full full resolution

465
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:26,958
on big prints essentially okay like if

466
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,879
you have an 8 by 11 picture of a

467
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,630
trichome and it's perfectly in focused

468
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,030
and beautiful

469
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:36,410
that's because somebody was using like a

470
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:40,039
5 to 1 lens it would allow you to shoot

471
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:42,259
that whole frame okay that makes sense I

472
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,869
get it you're zoomed into life like

473
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,309
you're zoomed into real life so

474
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,750
basically people got to know what

475
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,129
they're aiming for and that can lead us

476
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,450
into another part of this we're gonna

477
00:17:49,130 --> 00:18:00,050
kind of skip a little part of the notes

478
00:17:50,450 --> 00:18:02,660
that we made but we'll do that instead

479
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,250
of just shooting at random [ __ ] kind of

480
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,810
plan out your shot also that's a good

481
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,670
thing that's a good point since talking

482
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,079
about leader lens you're gonna have to

483
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,300
know what you're aiming for when you put

484
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,769
this lens on your camera you can't go

485
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,079
put it on your macro lens and then try

486
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:17,119
to take a picture of the top : you get

487
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,009
your 200 lens out to take pictures at

488
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,789
the top I kind of know what you're

489
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:24,049
aiming for plan your shot and like think

490
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:25,460
about like josa if you want to take a

491
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,349
picture of a trichome if you want to

492
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,519
take a picture of some soil think about

493
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,418
it and you'll you'll see

494
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,009
when he walks through the grow room

495
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:32,509
something will go right here look at

496
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,249
this and when it catches your eye that

497
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,808
means it catches the camera and try to

498
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:37,548
stand where you were land it got your

499
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:39,648
eye trying to try to replicate that a

500
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:43,069
little bit don't uh don't be scared to

501
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:45,108
take a lot of pictures even the same

502
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:46,999
thing and then you know they'll be that

503
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:48,499
one that's just like rice is the one

504
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,329
like if you have the time to you know

505
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:54,139
take some dabs and look through your

506
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,918
pictures like exactly we're not wasting

507
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:56,028
film anymore

508
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,830
we're just clicking away on a memory

509
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,659
card we're wasting RAM and we can delete

510
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:02,239
it all do it all over again tomorrow

511
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,679
so you just plan out your shot choose

512
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:05,808
the right lens for your shot yeah on

513
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,320
just just to make a correction on that

514
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:11,569
with the 200 the 55 to 200 when you're

515
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,950
at 200 I don't want anybody to think

516
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:14,898
that you can take a picture of a

517
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,459
trichome with the 200 it won't work that

518
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:18,828
way yeah I was gonna think of that you

519
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:21,739
can take a picture you can take really

520
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:23,658
close up good shots of nugs on your

521
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:25,700
plant you could take where you will see

522
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:27,499
each individual trichome as a dot

523
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,749
sometimes the stalk just depending on

524
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:32,028
how good the lighting is but don't think

525
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:35,450
you're gonna get that real super

526
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:37,398
official macro photography with without

527
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,348
a macro specific lens

528
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:41,569
I just wrote something down to try not

529
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:43,098
to forget it we're gonna go into

530
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,229
lighting next because you just hinted on

531
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,638
that but it has one huge hint I can give

532
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:54,409
you just super quickly get yourself

533
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:55,878
either a method seven lens or you can

534
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,640
just put the sunglasses right over your

535
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:59,378
camera if you're ghetto you can do that

536
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,329
[Music]

537
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:04,848
method seven makes a filter that cuts

538
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:06,798
out the hid the high intensity discharge

539
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:08,328
light it cuts that color out and you can

540
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,709
see the natural color of your plants so

541
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:12,019
if you're not able to take the plants

542
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,639
out of the room the method seven lens is

543
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,469
a good way to go so let's work into

544
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:17,298
lighting a little bit how should we be

545
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:19,999
lighting our cannabis plants when we're

546
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:22,759
taking pictures ideally not around HBS

547
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:24,440
lights not even t5 lights that's not

548
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,499
true light I mean it's super white it

549
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,269
looks good but it's not the true

550
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:30,950
representation of your plant okay

551
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,929
it puts a little bit of a blue to it

552
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,749
I've noticed certainly it could put any

553
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:39,019
hue on it just depending on the other

554
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:40,769
lights in the room or number a factor is

555
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,559
expecting from yeah okay

556
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:46,289
so you're lighting what's easiest you

557
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,690
know get in a room with really good

558
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,809
outside lighting or you know a whole

559
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,480
bunch of CFLs they're pretty pretty flat

560
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,950
white easy to color balance off of your

561
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,930
camera if you want to get into your

562
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,549
settings and do that but that's ideal if

563
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,740
you don't have that you have to stay in

564
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,690
your girl room you know turn the HPS

565
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,930
lights off and just turn your overhead

566
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:10,440
light on and use a flash okay

567
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:12,150
a flash will overcome a lot is the the

568
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,549
stock flash that came on most of our DSL

569
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,600
camera is going to be DSLR cameras is

570
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:17,220
that gonna be good enough or should we

571
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,319
get like a ring like a like an

572
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,029
aftermarket flash if you can afford an

573
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,490
aftermarket flash it is going to be a

574
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:26,639
lot far superior look through the one

575
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,049
built in but that's one that's built in

576
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,730
is not too shabby either it will

577
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,680
definitely get the job done for most

578
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,039
applications okay when you're getting an

579
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,330
aftermarket flash you should really know

580
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,629
why you're about to spend one hundred

581
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,589
and sixty dollars on a flash like

582
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,350
there's reasons for it I don't want to

583
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:47,369
tell you what they are because that's

584
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:51,149
cheating figure out the reason but we'll

585
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:52,739
get to some reasons later so more

586
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,750
lighting is usually the key right more

587
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,660
light more lighting the better so I mean

588
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,309
if you can Sun lights the most ideal but

589
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,470
I know everybody can't take their plants

590
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:02,669
outside my favorite meme is the old lady

591
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,170
looking out the window and it says

592
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,100
there's my neighbor taking pictures of

593
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:10,410
his bongs in the sunlight again all the

594
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,029
time I do because I follow usually pot

595
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:26,550
plants glass and pit bulls as my

596
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:28,680
Instagram feed so I wrote down settings

597
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,599
what kind of settings should I throw my

598
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,930
is it cool to just walk in there on auto

599
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,889
auto firing or absolutely there's

600
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,350
nothing wrong with that you'll get

601
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,030
pictures it'll be it'll be useful they

602
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:41,119
might not be the best but there

603
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,889
certainly will be usable be compared to

604
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,329
if you just throw it in manual without

605
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,040
knowing anything you know it'll prolly

606
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:53,129
just be black but settings you you when

607
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,148
you don't have ideal I'd say throw it in

608
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,129
auto from the most

609
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:58,498
there's no there's no reason to not use

610
00:22:56,128 --> 00:23:01,198
auto if you have great lighting Auto is

611
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:03,899
the best setting just because it's

612
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:05,519
continually correct it will just make

613
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:07,198
everything easy and pretty and you can

614
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,598
focus on taking the pictures especially

615
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:13,379
if you're not getting paid like you

616
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:15,028
don't need to be 1,000% perfect on

617
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:16,738
everything very true if they're just for

618
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:18,719
your Instagram feed right you don't need

619
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:20,429
to be all critical about of course if

620
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:24,538
you want to be critical more power to

621
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:25,589
you yeah that's part of the art so

622
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,358
settings are gonna be for what if you

623
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:29,818
want to take pictures in the dark just

624
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:32,878
using flash randomly to overcome the HBS

625
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:35,188
or when the HBS's are on and you have to

626
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:38,968
change the setting in your camera to

627
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:40,319
filter out that on the fly don't be

628
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,159
afraid to change settings you guys it's

629
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,298
something you're gonna have to learn to

630
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,299
do with the camera it's something I've

631
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:50,068
just recently accepted is it every shot

632
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:51,148
I may have to change a setting to photos

633
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:53,068
I thought I could just go in there and

634
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:54,748
put it on you know put the after setting

635
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:55,979
here to the ISO to here put the white

636
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:57,629
balance here just go there and shoot

637
00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:01,229
from every angle and it'd be legit but

638
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:02,788
you want to shoot from you want to take

639
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:04,739
all the pictures you want to take from

640
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:07,408
thee without moving

641
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:08,759
basically yeah standard one spot take

642
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,749
all the pictures you want to take and

643
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,219
move to the next spot take all the

644
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:14,489
pictures you want to take and do it

645
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:17,338
systematically okay I mean tell anybody

646
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:19,019
what to do no but that's what especially

647
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:20,878
when you're going through your pictures

648
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,229
and everything is grouped I mean you're

649
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,378
gonna be sitting down standing up

650
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:26,999
leaning over leaning backwards in one

651
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:28,708
spot without moving too much so you

652
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,989
really get a good feel of what that

653
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:32,429
angle is bringing to the table yeah and

654
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:33,808
don't be afraid to take weird angles you

655
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,298
guys some of the best shots are really

656
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:39,749
weird angles hanging off of a ladder

657
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:41,578
upside down backwards that's right good

658
00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:42,838
[ __ ] comes out of there alright so we

659
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:44,598
talked about settings a little bit we

660
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:46,759
got lighting we got lint selection

661
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:50,398
sloppy brought up a great point earlier

662
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:53,489
slop asked me what is acceptable editing

663
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,928
for cannabis photography and Joe had a

664
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,479
great answer I'll let you give that

665
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,329
answer it just don't don't edit

666
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:02,308
maliciously yes by that Joe means like

667
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:04,048
myself I'm a seed breeder right I own a

668
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:06,418
company I try to sell seeds if I were to

669
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:07,980
edit the photos I take of the plants

670
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,049
that come from my seeds I feel like you

671
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,579
would be misleading I added out the

672
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:13,139
background I added out people

673
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,369
I added out other plants if there's

674
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,320
another plant next to it I'll go ahead

675
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:19,558
and blur that one but I don't edit the

676
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,558
subject at all most of the time like 99%

677
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,899
of my Instagram and my website are all

678
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,519
unedited and if they are edited you can

679
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,590
tell cuz it's black and white or it's

680
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,029
something awkward but if you're in there

681
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:31,379
making the pistils pink and you're

682
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,759
trying to sell a pack of seeds and those

683
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,230
pistols weren't pink that's what we'll

684
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,500
call malicious editing don't do that

685
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,579
[ __ ] but if you're doing it for art

686
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,869
like look at this beautiful cannabis

687
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,949
plant that's cool but if you're trying

688
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:51,899
to take credit for growing this

689
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:54,600
beautiful play with the colors and there

690
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,480
are certain instances when you have to

691
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,789
edit like if you weren't you know you're

692
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,558
not always in the best condition for

693
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:03,980
pictures right you don't always have the

694
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,690
best opportunity to take a picture

695
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,360
sometimes you just have to snap snap

696
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,850
snap snap you got to come back to some

697
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,319
Photoshop and clean it up yep which is

698
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:15,149
acceptable at that point it just depends

699
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,539
on what you're doing with it yeah I

700
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,330
agree

701
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,480
all right so now that you've learned how

702
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:23,490
to select a camera you've got all your

703
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,870
accessories you figured out what kind of

704
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,250
lenses you're gonna use you got a cool

705
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:27,569
light to play with

706
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,740
you've been tweaking on the camera

707
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,869
settings you learned how to do some

708
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,250
editing I just gotta get there in a grow

709
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,659
room or whatever your plants are and

710
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,940
just take a shitload of pictures you

711
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,730
guys just take pictures change the

712
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,960
settings play with the settings don't be

713
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,789
afraid like I said earlier don't be

714
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,710
afraid to get out of auto if you get out

715
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:46,168
of auto mode I like to take pictures in

716
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,480
Auto and then take a note on where what

717
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:51,000
Otto did Otto will say everything Otto

718
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,009
put the ISO at this or the white balance

719
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,929
or the shutter speed or the aperture

720
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:56,669
setting was here I ought oh we'll take a

721
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,620
note for you in the photo if you save it

722
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:59,880
right and then look at that no and then

723
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,918
write that down and then if you've got a

724
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,750
really killer picture try to duplicate

725
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,000
that setting in that environment then

726
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,619
remember like when I was in this setting

727
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,240
flat this environment last time I threw

728
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:10,859
on this setting and I took really killer

729
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,150
pictures and then you'll start making

730
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,500
mental notes of it you'll just it'll

731
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,360
start coming naturally to you

732
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,400
that's really nifty that's

733
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,959
if the shoes on the camera if you saw if

734
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,519
you see if you've got a decent camera a

735
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,870
good expensive camera it'll show you

736
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,670
what the settings were when you take it

737
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,859
and unfortunately a lot of those cameras

738
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,720
are also putting GPS locations in there

739
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:34,309
so you have to go turn that setting off

740
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:41,569
in your camera that's a good tip guys is

741
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:42,889
the future don't want that so then go

742
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,569
take pictures you guys and then just

743
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,920
start planning out better shots just

744
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,299
start shooting more and then you'll

745
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,680
learn how to set it you'll learn how to

746
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,629
get to a better setting you'll learn how

747
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,220
to plan out your shot frame your shot

748
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,110
and then you'll learn more how to edit

749
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,720
them and then I think that'll put you on

750
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:58,939
the way to making amazing photography

751
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,890
and then you can have seventeen to

752
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,480
twenty five to fifty five thousand

753
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,390
followers on Instagram and you can write

754
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,490
in the club yeah take notes when you do

755
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:22,280
it there you go slap how many Instagram

756
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:23,750
followers do you have over there all

757
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,700
right I feel like I have covered all of

758
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,250
the notes that I have written down I see

759
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,450
that Joe's got a little what do you call

760
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,400
it bullet point thing over there

761
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,039
something yeah yeah the only thing

762
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,810
really that I would want to say is use

763
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,599
the Internet it's an amazing resource

764
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:40,849
for everything you know anything that

765
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,379
you want to learn about anything

766
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:45,230
especially photography is out there

767
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,810
there's a lot of people who have blogs

768
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,509
and YouTube channels I like a guy that

769
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,769
calls himself fro grows I think okay

770
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,230
he's got a YouTube channel on

771
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:56,450
photography a lot of photographers are

772
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,160
kind of stale to watch because they're

773
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,259
good at photography and not personal

774
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,970
presentation yeah but frog Rose is

775
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:07,879
definitely educational absolutely that's

776
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,420
all I'm saying is find somebody that you

777
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,310
can watch and just watch them work you

778
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,930
can learn a lot from them yeah you can

779
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:16,789
it's such a crash course sometimes on

780
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,070
YouTube they show you exactly what you

781
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,059
want to see all right it's not you got

782
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:22,970
anything to say over there bro you look

783
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,889
blaze yeah don't be scared to use your

784
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,579
imagination and just get in the grow

785
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,739
room and

786

and get down on one knee or look at it

787
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:31,669
from a weird angle take pictures from

788
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,709
inside the plant like really get in

789
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,440
there the possibilities for pictures are

790
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,419
endless like do it your imagination is

791
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,360

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:08,039
right so yeah telling everybody how much

977
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,700
of a criminal you are and how you would

978
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:15,650
never assume that I had any kind of

979
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:15,649
besides just stereotyping like tattoos

980
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,900
hey we can't be seen right now I get

981
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,730
comfortable but yeah besides

982
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,200
stereotyping I just from appearance the

983
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,550
way that I present myself you you

984
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,730
wouldn't really assume that I had any

985
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:32,789
past experience with organizations or

986
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,409
just criminal activity at all but uh man

987
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:35,150
the main thing I want to talk about is

988
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:38,088
just

989
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:40,818
really like how much has changed being

990
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:42,440
able to smoke bud freely and grow but in

991
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:45,288
the stress reliever that comes with it

992
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,059
uh I mean I started smoking weed back in

993
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:50,229
fifth grade I don't know the age that

994
00:41:47,059 --> 00:42:00,829
you are in fifth grade I have been yeah

995
00:41:50,228 --> 00:42:03,228
I wouldn't you were probably 14 um I

996
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:05,210
went to a minority school I am NOT a

997
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:07,399
minority so I was integrated into a

998
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,929
minority school and put in the paper and

999
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,239
stuff and it was 5th grade through 12th

1000
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:13,940
grade in one school and I used to walk

1001
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,298
home with all the older kids I won't say

1002
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,608
any names but shout out to who you are

1003
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:20,690
and you know the neighborhood was right

1004
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:22,880
behind the school so we would walk home

1005
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,608
and they always smoked every day and

1006
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,048
then one day they were just like do you

1007
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:28,400
want to smoke too and I didn't even know

1008
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,420
it was bad I've seen other people smoke

1009
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,099
cigarettes I don't really know the

1010
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,349
difference between what people are

1011
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:35,778
smoking and I remember that day we

1012
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:37,729
smoked a blunt we went and sat in their

1013
00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:39,798
shed and played Sega Genesis for like

1014
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:41,868
two hours until my mom got off work and

1015
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:44,150
they never brought up anything being

1016
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:45,818
wrong until right when my mom was gonna

1017
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,349
get there and they looked at me and said

1018
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:51,048
tell her you have a headache and go to

1019
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:53,028
your room don't eat anything and then

1020
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:55,248
that was the daily routine after that

1021
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:58,548
forever but I've always had to hide

1022
00:42:55,248 --> 00:43:02,348
smoking weed and and all of that own I

1023
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:05,028
have a paraphernalia charge for a roach

1024
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:07,180
literally just a roach in North Carolina

1025
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:10,179
that's where I'm from North Carolina

1026
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:12,889
they're [ __ ] like they don't care

1027
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:14,659
they they came to a house they were

1028
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:17,179
serving a warrant they smelled marijuana

1029
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:18,519
came in the house they I was there's

1030
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:21,639
like

1031
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,619
I was the only white person there and

1032
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:25,059
they kept there was like two bombs in

1033
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:26,349
the house and the police came up to me

1034
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,960
and they're like oh these must be yours

1035
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:30,610
because you're white and I'm a smartass

1036
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,920
so I looked at them was like actually I

1037
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,539
smoke blunts instead of just being like

1038
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,079
I don't smoke cuz you know I'm an

1039
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:37,239
[ __ ] uh

1040
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,980
so they walked over to the ashtray

1041
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,259
grabbed a roach dropped in front of me

1042
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,449
and said paraphernalia and it is still

1043
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,370
to this day on my record was that a

1044
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:48,819
felony or a misdemeanor misdemeanor okay

1045
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:50,409
I hate that there's only two levels of

1046
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,450
charges like misdemeanor felony because

1047
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:54,009
felonies are in there with like rapists

1048
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:55,989
and murderers that's that's messed up

1049
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,940
like in North Carolina you can get a

1050
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:00,039
felony I think they changed it now but

1051
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:08,340
when I was growing up anything over 1/2

1052
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:12,219
ounce of marijuana was a felony so I

1053
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,630
don't need that but now I think you can

1054
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:15,489
have an ounce and a half which still

1055
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,890
isn't [ __ ] like you could have a pound

1056
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,489
of hurt anybody it's all about what

1057
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:23,440
you're doing

1058
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:26,049
um but marijuana really gave me an out

1059
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,460
from where I was before I was in

1060
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:34,180
Colorado I was in a camper that was like

1061
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:36,190
10 by 10 with no insulation it had nails

1062
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:38,619
coming through the roof and I literally

1063
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,329
ran an extension cord from the camper to

1064
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:42,460
somebody's well because you know what

1065
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:45,429
the well they had that for like lights

1066
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,250
and stuff and I had my Mac computer in

1067
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:49,359
there and I just made music and and

1068
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,699
smoke weed and did mushrooms and stuff

1069
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:56,140
so it's a good life it was it was

1070
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:58,689
alright but it was it was it was shitty

1071
00:44:56,139 --> 00:45:01,449
you know and then one day a good friend

1072
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,630
of mine Spencer from Garden whedon a big

1073
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:06,849
shout out to all of them Mattia my

1074
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,650
everybody really uh but he just called

1075
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:09,849
or like we were talking on Facebook at

1076
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,309
first and then he called me he was like

1077
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,589

1080
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,719
rather just come here and grow weed and

1081
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,669
it was really an impulse decision like

1082
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,689
everybody thought I was bullshitting I

1083
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,730
was like in two weeks

1084
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,789
I'm how like I'm going to Colorado how I

1085
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,409
heard it - yeah it was like two weeks

1086
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:33,630
gonna take the room downstairs

1087
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:35,670
alright you know and I did take that

1088
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,300
room and I slept right next to that oven

1089
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:41,880
forever and it is like chilled out boom

1090
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,830
ya know uh I did I just told everybody I

1091
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,980

1092
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:49,679

1093
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,500
all it's been it's been amazing here

1094
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,619
just there's so many people with the

1095
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,440
same line stay and positive energies and

1096
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:01,289
just trying to help each other and

1097
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,179
progress in life I feel like that's big

1098
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:04,469
people don't like progressing I'm right

1099
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,980
some people are stuck and want to be

1100
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:09,059
okay with where they are yeah in content

1101
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,079
that's why I got this group of people

1102
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:11,369
here at this table because we're all

1103
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,949
people that are all about moving each

1104
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:15,869
other and ourselves forward a little bit

1105
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:16,889
can't ever be comfortable no no as soon

1106
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:19,139
as you're comfortable that's when you

1107
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:20,460
start [ __ ] up stagnation yeah if you

1108
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,279
want to be ahead you got to keep moving

1109
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,500
right yeah if you're if life is super

1110
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,300
duper easy and you do the same thing

1111
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,980
every day and not much changes and

1112
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,980
you're unhappy about it

1113
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,660
the only one thing to do that's right

1114
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,820
yep make the progression take the next

1115
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,929
steps like if you're already stuck and

1116
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:43,630
frustrated what are you gonna do make

00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:27,610
yes it was um like I can remember so

1136
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:30,160
vividly the first time that garden of

1137
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:34,570
Weeden oh I could remember the first

1138
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:40,719
time I took official dab I got off I got

1139
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:42,130
off the plane and when she pulled the

1140
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,149
ring in the torch out man he pulled the

1141
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,599
ring in the torch out I looked at

1142
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,190
earlier

1143
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:55,509
[Music]

1144
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:58,659
no it's weed and then I took a DAB and I

1145
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:00,820
literally just laid my face on the

1146
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:02,079
window and just stared so you're saying

1147
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,730
I've been in the car when you got your

1148
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:11,849
first dab yes you were off the plane

1149
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,849
within three seconds of being in the car

1150
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,430
yes but I can I can I can totally

1151
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,650
remember the first time that they were

1152
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:41,659
like the lights cut on and they were

1153
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:44,510
like brought me into the garden it was

1154
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:47,029
I would like to say it was all white

1155
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,470
widow and to blue dream plants in there

1156
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:51,819
and all you could smell was the blue

1157
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:55,129
dream it was that is correct amazing yes

1158
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:57,858
I remember the feeling like in my body

1159
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,720
of like overwhelming sensations that

1160
00:48:57,858 --> 00:49:01,098
like I honestly thought that I would

1161
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,500
never experience something like that

1162
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,260
without going to another country because

1163
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,179
it's crazy it's just plants but back in

1164
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:12,799
North Carolina if you have that mini

1165
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:15,889
plate you are they think they like coma

1166
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:21,739
swat4 andi Taisen and shooting like this

1167
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:24,440
plan is in a spongy and kill the first

1168
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,808
thing they would shoot your dog I know

1169
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:50,510
this sounds crazy but if they shoot my

1170
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:54,170
dog in front of me it's going down you

1171
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,400

1344
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,840

cool to see like uh real perspectives of

1354
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:50,880

really enjoy periscope it's it's it's a

1357
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,490

just because I like other countries I

1361
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:19,710
like seeing what's up in China and China

1362

1363
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,500
American they'll be cool to be talking

1364
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:23,819

1373
00:59:38,289 --> 01:00:09,130
white people when we go on periscope at

1374

01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:16,510
right so you got people watching and

1378
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:19,180
they're talking to me it could be yeah I

1379
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:20,619

1439
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:37,099
you know and and the thing with the car

1440
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:40,390
is you could have the quick D attachment

1441
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:40,389
so it just looks like a breathalyzer

1442
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:51,400
in the car the car the [ __ ] in the

01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,480
but there's been so much important

1611
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,210
that I felt like it's been my job to

1612
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:19,500
bring that news to the cannabis world so

1613
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,300
you're right I have gotten a little bit

1614
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,069
away from the grow lessons and I got a

1615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,510
lot into the news but you know what

1616
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:27,210
we're gonna get back in the grow lessons

1617
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,800
I've got part of this will be a little

1618
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,868
bit about grow lessons and then the next

1619
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,090
episode is going to be about pH which is

1620
01:11:30,868 --> 01:11:34,649
all about growing so Fred you're totally

1621
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,500
correct and I will fix that we'll get

1622
01:11:34,649 --> 01:11:38,789
back to the grow lessons my friend but

1623
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,689
before we get that far I know I just

1624
01:11:38,789 --> 01:11:41,158
said we're gonna get back in a girl

1625
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:43,289
lessons and get away from the news but

1626
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:44,158
I've already had this episode plan so

1627
01:11:43,289 --> 01:11:46,500
you're gonna have to bear with me

1628
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,210
because there's a very important news

1629
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,319
article that I want to read to you I'm

1630
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,969
thumbing through my computer trying to

1631
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,558
find it now to tell you the truth there

1632
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:53,789
we go all right we're gonna get right to

1633
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:56,489
it this news article comes from the

1634
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:58,319
cannabis I found this very important

1635
01:11:56,488 --> 01:12:00,000
since I have recently taken over as the

1636
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:03,029
lead grower at the spot dispensary in

1637
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,590
Pueblo West Colorado I'm running a large

1638
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:05,698
facility things like this really stand

1639
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,078
out to me so let's get right to the

1640
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:08,698
article you guys business from the

1641
01:12:07,078 --> 01:12:11,189
cannabis and it was written by Kristen

1642
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:13,469
Wyatt of The Associated Press the

1643
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:15,539
headline is unknowns abound in pesticide

1644
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:17,520
use for growing pot then the sub

1645
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,260
headline says there is no federal agency

1646
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,329
that will recognize this as a legitimate

1647
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:24,000
crop pest management information

1648
01:12:21,328 --> 01:12:26,250
regarding this crop devolves to internet

1649
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,889
chats and hearsay says Whitney Crenshaw

1650
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:31,500
a Colorado State University entomologist

1651
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:33,449
and pesticide expert so obviously this

1652
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,479
is going to be about pesticides and bugs

1653
01:12:33,448 --> 01:12:38,879
and cannabis plants so the article goes

1654
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:41,129
like this microscopic bugs and mildew

1655
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,050
can destroy a marijuana operation faster

1656
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:44,969
than any police raise and because the

1657
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:47,159
crop has been illegal for so long either

1658
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:51,078
growers nor scientists have any reliable

1659
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:51,078
research to help fight the infestation

1660
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:59,340
the number one obstacle can be bugs it

1661
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,989
is hard as hell to get rid of bugs in a

1662
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,520
grow room if you're not experienced and

1663
01:13:00,988 --> 01:13:04,259
if you don't know what you're doing so

1664
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,760
we'll keep going it says as legal

1665
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,530
marijuana moves from basements and

1666
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,570
backwoods to warehouses and commercial

1667
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:11,309
fields the mold and spider mites that

1668
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:13,380
once ruined only a few plants at a time

1669
01:13:11,309 --> 01:13:15,690
can now quickly create a multi-million

1670
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,609
dollar crisis for growers some returning

1671
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:20,189
to industrial-strength chemicals raising

1672
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:22,198
concerns about safety they see

1673
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:24,868
multi-million dollar crisis for growers

1674
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:26,979
they are not kidding you guys the

1675
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:29,738
facility that we are that I am

1676
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:33,069
that I am helping them finish build we

1677
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:35,019
have four flower grooms and one of those

1678
01:13:33,069 --> 01:13:38,469
rooms has 26

1679
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:41,410
kavita lights hanging in there our

1680
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:42,820
projections are almost anybody's goal if

1681
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:45,519
you're drawing with a Kavita your goal

1682
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:47,529
is 2 pounds per light so that's 52

1683
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,750
projected pounds of cannabis coming out

1684
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:51,219
of that room I can't really tell you

1685
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,899
what the going rate is for a pound of

1686
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:55,780
cannabis in Colorado right now at a

1687
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:58,479
retail center or being sold from retail

1688
01:13:55,779 --> 01:14:00,340
to retail center but that is quite an

1689
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,979
investment if I were to [ __ ] up 52

1690
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,630
pounds of weed that would really cost us

1691
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:09,309
quite a bit of money we would not make

1692
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:11,260
money that's a bummer the first place

1693
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:13,000
you can't pay the bills then your short

1694
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,280
money then you don't have product on the

1695
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,979
shelf it would cause a lot of problems

1696
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,300
obviously you can see how 152 pounds

1697
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:21,159
artist it really caused a lot of

1698
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,869
problems and then you've got all the

1699
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:25,180
wasted time and the wasted plants

1700
01:14:22,869 --> 01:14:27,279
because the plants cost money all the

1701
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:29,500
wasted nutrients all the wasted

1702
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,590
electricity it could really add up

1703
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,409
quickly so I'm going to continue the

1704
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,789
article here where was I herbicides and

1705
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:38,319
insecticides are regulated by the

1706
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:40,720
federal government which still regards

1707
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,699
almost all marijuana as an illicit crop

1708
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:45,190
so there's no roadmap to help pop

1709
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:46,689
farmers chemists and horticulturalists

1710
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,549
can't offer much assistance either

1711
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:50,529
they sometimes disagree about how to

1712
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,230
combat the problem largely because the

1713
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:54,849
plant is used in many different ways

1714
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:57,579
smoke eaten and sometimes rubbed into

1715
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:59,500
the skin we have an industry that's been

1716
01:14:57,579 --> 01:15:01,390
illegal for so many years that there's

1717
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,159
no research there's no guidelines

1718
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:05,560
there's nothing said Frank Conrad live

1719
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:06,939
director of Colorado green lab a pod

1720
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,380
testing lab in Denver

1721
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:10,419
in states that regulate marijuana

1722
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:12,460
officials are just starting to draft

1723
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:14,890
rules governing safe levels of chemicals

1724
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:17,319
so far there have been no reports on any

1725
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:19,450
human illness traced to chemicals used

1726
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:21,849
on marijuana but worries due for cysts

1727
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:24,130
the city of Denver the spring quarantine

1728
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:26,320
tens of thousands of marijuana plants at

1729
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:28,329
11 growing facilities after health

1730
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,789
inspectors suspected use of unauthorized

1731
01:15:28,329 --> 01:15:32,559
pesticides some of the plants were later

1732
01:15:30,789 --> 01:15:35,079
released after tests revealed the pot

1733
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,840
was safe but two producers voluntarily

1734
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:39,859
destroyed their plants actually there

1735
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,400
was about 600

1736
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:45,859
of cannabis voluntarily destroyed

1737
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:47,899
because of illegal pesticides the

1738
01:15:45,859 --> 01:15:50,719
article says businesses still have at

1739
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:52,789
least some plants in quarantine the

1740
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,319
article goes on to say in Oregon a June

1741
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:56,658
investigation by The Oregonian newspaper

1742
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,210
found pesticides in excess of legal

1743
01:15:56,658 --> 01:16:00,738
limits on produce on products ranging

1744
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:03,319
from marijuana buds too concentrated

1745
01:16:00,738 --> 01:16:04,638
marijuana oils other pesticides are

1746
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:06,529
detected on the marijuana are not

1747
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,600
regulated by Oregon's marijuana rules

1748
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:11,750
meaning the products containing those

1749
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,460
chemicals still can be sold there the US

1750
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,500
Environmental Protection Agency which

1751
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,779
decides which pesticides can be used on

1752
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,908
which crops just said last month they

1753
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:21,829
Colorado and Washington authorities that

1754
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:23,388
they could apply to have some cannabis

1755
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:25,609
related chemicals approved through

1756
01:16:23,389 --> 01:16:28,010
what's called a special local need

1757
01:16:25,609 --> 01:16:31,099
registration but that process could take

1758
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:34,969
years so looks like we're on our way but

1759
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:36,949
it could take Colorado and Oregon

1760
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:38,448
require retail marijuana to undergo

1761
01:16:36,948 --> 01:16:40,399
testing for pesticides and other

1762
01:16:38,448 --> 01:16:42,649
contaminants but as the Oregon an

1763
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,988
investigation showed the testing regimes

1764
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:46,908
are imperfect and Colorado hasn't yet

1765
01:16:44,988 --> 01:16:49,129
implemented requirements for retail pot

1766
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:51,259
to undergo pesticide testing because of

1767
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,880
regulatory delays there aren't any labs

1768
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,070
here that'll test for you guys that's

1769
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,929
part of the problem a Washington state

1770
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:59,118
is still working on its pesticide rules

1771
01:16:56,929 --> 01:17:01,880
the nation's largest marijuana producer

1772
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:05,198
California has no regulations at all for

1773
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:08,840
growing commercial pot you know up until

1774
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:11,829
this industry got hugely popular on a

1775
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:14,960
recreational and legal level the

1776
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:18,050
guidelines and the people who were

1777
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,760
responsible for quality control

1778
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:22,550
were the growers we were the ones

1779
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,079
responsible for that it was a craft it

1780
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:26,539
was an art it was something that we were

1781
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,550
proud of we would not let out a product

1782
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:30,560
that had been sprayed with some [ __ ]

1783
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:32,750
or a product that had powdery mildew on

1784
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,600
it we were the ones who were responsible

1785
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:37,760
for that and took that responsibility

1786
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,739
and now that it's so commercially

1787
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,409
popular and everybody's buying and

1788
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,968
growing and selling cannabis the art and

1789
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:45,769
the love I hope you guys heard that that

1790
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:48,920
was some amazing thunder it's finally

1791
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:50,960
raining we've needed it but it was my

1792
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,350
responsibility now that it's so popular

1793
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,090
everyone's worried about the money

1794
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:55,710
gotten away from the art and the pride

1795
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,680
and they're just doing whatever they can

1796
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,060
do to get plants on the ground pounds

1797
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,840
out the door and money in the cash

1798
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:03,210
register

1799
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,199
customers out the door and that's not

1800
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,600
really what it's about

1801
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:08,130
so since people have lost the heart

1802
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,110
they're not growing from their heart

1803
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:11,640
like I try to teach them to do we have

1804
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:12,989
to come up with some sort of testing and

1805
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,240
we have to create rules and this is

1806
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:16,500
where we are so it says it's a lot more

1807
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:17,939
difficult than it sounds and it's

1808
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,619
expensive Washington liquor bore

1809
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:21,689
Washington's Liquor Control Board

1810
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:25,289
spokesman Brian Smith said about testing

1811
01:18:21,689 --> 01:18:26,969
for pesticides as a result unscrupulous

1812
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:30,210
pot growers can use banned chemicals

1813
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:31,920
with little chance of being caught we

1814
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:34,260
were taken by surprise this whole

1815
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,090
pesticides taken by surprise this whole

1816
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,739
pesticide issue said Ashley Kilroy

1817
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:40,140
Denver's Director of Marijuana Policy

1818
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:43,039
she was talking to a room of about 200

1819
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:46,550
pot industry workers who invited and

1820
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:49,500
yeah it doesn't it's missing a word here

1821
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:51,600
invited lunch after the invited to a

1822
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,010
lunch maybe earlier this month to

1823
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,420
learned about pesticide quarantines and

1824
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:56,489
rules sorry they skipped a word of this

1825
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:59,970
article and it totally threw me off it's

1826
01:18:56,489 --> 01:19:01,829
just as invited lunch so that's weird

1827
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:03,510
we'll keep going what the growers heard

1828
01:19:01,829 --> 01:19:05,819
wasn't encouraging there's no federal

1829
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,800
agency that will recognize this as a

1830
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:09,869
legitimate crop said Whitney Crenshaw a

1831
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,420
Colorado State University entomologist

1832
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:14,220
and pesticide expert regulators just

1833
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,840
bury their heads and as a result pest

1834
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:18,690
management information regarding this

1835
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,520
crop devolves to internet chats and

1836
01:19:18,689 --> 01:19:23,129
hearsay and you guys don't want to go

1837
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:25,440
start reading about how to battle bugs

1838
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:26,730
or powdery mildew on a large scale on

1839
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,899
the internet because there's so much

1840
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:29,099
[ __ ] that you'll have to feed

1841
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:30,719
through that if you don't have a good

1842
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,390
base knowledge it'll just confuse you

1843
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:35,400
and mess you up even more so marijuana

1844
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:37,200
growers are indeed guessing when they

1845
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:38,519
treat their plants for example one of

1846
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:41,069
the chemicals cited in Denver

1847
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,980
quarantines a fungicide called eagle 20

1848
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:46,109
is commonly used on grapes and hops but

1849
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,659
can become dangerous when heated and is

1850
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:50,639
banned for use on tobacco no research

1851
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:53,309
exists on whether the fungicide is safe

1852
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,340
for use on pot that will be eat now

1853
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:58,800
something i've read recently about

1854
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,800
exactly Eagle 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside

1855
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,719
of a per

1856
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,809
it goes in the play is what it doesn't

1857
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:07,480
it stops the plan from producing powdery

1858
01:20:04,809 --> 01:20:11,289
mildew and it can last for sixty to

1859
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:12,698
ninety days in the plan so that's a

1860
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:14,408
little crazy if you understand the plant

1861
01:20:12,698 --> 01:20:16,658
biology there but also what I've read is

1862
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:19,598
if it gets on your skin it absorbs into

1863
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:21,399
your skin and it changes your RNA and

1864
01:20:19,599 --> 01:20:23,230
you won't notice it because you might

1865
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:25,299
not live long enough to even notice the

1866
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:27,218
changes that occurred in your body but

1867
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,199
your grandchildren will be affected by

1868
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:33,819
this your grandchildren will have birth

1869
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:36,069
defects attention deficit disorders that

1870
01:20:33,819 --> 01:20:37,779
is what this type of chemical does it

1871
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:39,939
doesn't [ __ ] you up but it messes you up

1872
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:42,368
in the insides to where your kids kids

1873
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:44,348
are messed up which is that's got to be

1874
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:44,828
some serious dangerous [ __ ] I don't want

1875
01:20:44,349 --> 01:20:46,480
to mess with

1876
01:20:44,828 --> 01:20:48,340
I don't want sprayed on my plants I

1877
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,178
don't want sprayed on your plants we'll

1878
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,159
keep doing here

1879
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:53,020
several fog growers interviewed by The

1880
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:54,969
Associated Press agreed that research is

1881
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,469
needed on pesticides for pot but they

1882
01:20:54,969 --> 01:20:58,448
pointed out that pesticides are widely

1883
01:20:56,469 --> 01:21:00,279
used on food crops and that weed

1884
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:02,049
consumers have never before had as much

1885
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:04,389
information about the marijuana they buy

1886
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:06,090
it's just like broccoli or spinach or

1887
01:21:04,389 --> 01:21:08,289
peaches or anything the plant isn't

1888
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:13,328
susceptible to certain pests said

1889
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:15,010
Gabriel Fair 4th anyway who is

1890
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:16,448
cultivation manager of Denver's herbal

1891
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:19,090
remedies I apologize for butchering your

1892
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:20,678
name there Ferris does not use any

1893
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:22,328
banned chemicals on his plants and it

1894
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:23,440
was not affected by the quarantines but

1895
01:21:22,328 --> 01:21:25,328
he questioned some of the banned

1896
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:26,859
chemicals if you have all these

1897
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:28,569
chemicals that are safe on product to

1898
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:29,920
eat but you can't use them on marijuana

1899
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:33,130
I don't know that I agree with that

1900
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,800
the oldest marijuana legalization

1901
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:38,078
advocacy group Keith Straub of the

1902
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,369
normal organization National

1903
01:21:38,078 --> 01:21:41,859
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana

1904
01:21:39,368 --> 01:21:43,269
Laws pointed out that regulators today

1905
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:45,848
are at least starting to look at

1906
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:47,170
marijuana safely in the 1980's the

1907
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,969
federal government used an herbicide

1908
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:51,130
called paraquat to kill illicit

1909
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:52,989
marijuana crops even though the poison

1910
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:55,420
had been banned from national forests

1911
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:57,069
because of environmental concerns normal

1912
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,719
complained to the White House that some

1913
01:21:57,069 --> 01:22:01,179
of the weeds survived it was turning up

1914
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,800
on the street the response was it's

1915
01:22:01,179 --> 01:22:05,440
illegal and we don't have any obligation

1916
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,480
not to poison its crop recalled

1917
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,549
no one was taking us seriously that is

1918
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:11,078
kind of sick baby poison to this weed

1919
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,429
the weed made it to the street and when

1920
01:22:11,078 --> 01:22:13,079
they said hey this weeds out there they

1921
01:22:12,429 --> 01:22:14,699
went

1922
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:16,800
problem bro it's illegal don't [ __ ] with

1923
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:19,050
it oh it's tough love from the

1924
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,579
government right their recent actions by

1925
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,560
states with legal weed have been

1926
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:24,600
encouraging if slow he said the idea

1927
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,490
that it's been up it's been on the black

1928
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,350
market people are fine so therefore we

1929
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:31,019
don't need testing is absurd Straub said

1930
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:34,380
no one would want to be using a product

1931
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:36,570
that hole has mold or pesticides and

1932
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,789
that is very true nobody wants to smoke

1933
01:22:36,569 --> 01:22:39,989
a product that has mold or pesticides in

1934
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:41,729
it that's just gross why do you even

1935
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:42,960
want to put that into your body why do

1936
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:44,699
you want to put that in your pipe

1937
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,199
why do you as a grower why would you

1938
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,639
want to put that out there why would you

1939
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:49,769
act like you're proud why would you even

1940
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:52,470
sell that to somebody that's just

1941
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:54,480
weirdness to me so that article came

1942
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,949
from I'm scrolling back up to remember

1943
01:22:54,479 --> 01:23:11,339
her name it is Kristin Wyatt from The

1944
01:22:55,949 --> 01:23:13,739
Associated Press I need a drink alright

1945
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:15,480
so was a grower I find it kind of wrong

1946
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,920
that people would even spray some of

1947
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:18,719
this [ __ ] on their plants I don't use

1948
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,840
anything that is not completely organic

1949
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:23,880
and honestly I avoid using sprays but

1950
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,400
since I work in agro and I go to a lot

1951
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:28,890
of groves I know that I'm putting myself

1952
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,799
at risk so I need some sort of safety

1953
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:33,570
net so I do use products I try not to

1954
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,119
use too much neem oil because neem oil

1955
01:23:33,569 --> 01:23:37,679
will definitely affect the flavor of my

1956
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:39,300
extracts so there are certain things

1957
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,650
that I'll use certain things that I

1958
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,720
won't use and we've definitely been

1959
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,979
talking about what we will and won't use

1960
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,980
at the shop because there are things

1961
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:49,769
that we definitely do not want to put in

1962
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:51,869
our crop as a shop I think you guys are

1963
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:53,550
gonna grow weed or cannabis or pot or

1964
01:23:51,869 --> 01:23:54,960
whatever you want to call it who's gonna

1965
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:57,119
consume the products that you're growing

1966
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,619
our goal is to make people feel better

1967
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:00,779
and not give them cancer or lung disease

1968
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:02,039
alright so don't spray some [ __ ] on your

1969
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:02,819
plants it's gonna give somebody cancer

1970
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:04,710
or lung disease

1971
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:06,299
don't spray anything on your plants that

1972
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:08,609
you wouldn't spray on your produce and

1973
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,380
then eat it I think that's what that

1974
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:13,199
should be our new guideline and also you

1975
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:14,940
guys think about what would happen if we

1976
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,889
gave some contaminated products to a

1977
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:20,219
person with a compromised immune system

1978
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:21,390
I'm a caregiver and one of my favorite

1979
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:24,539
patients I'm a medical marijuana

1980
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:26,350
caregiver which means I am I responsible

1981
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:28,899
for growing

1982
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:30,820
a few people's medical cannabis and I've

1983
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:34,089
got a patient his name is Doug and

1984
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:36,219
Doug's an older dude he's over 50 years

1985
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:37,539
old and he's not in good health since

1986
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,850
I've known him he's had three or four

1987
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:42,460
major health problems in just a few

1988
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:44,380
years that I've known it I grow medical

1989
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,779
cannabis for Doug to make Doug feel

1990
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:49,420
better I grow medical cannabis for Doug

1991
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:51,909
to help Doug live longer I'm trying to

1992
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:53,409
improve Doug's life when I'm mixing up

1993
01:24:51,909 --> 01:25:03,220
nutrients and reading the back of a

1994
01:24:53,409 --> 01:25:05,529
nutrient bottle Doug

1995
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:07,570
feel better so if I see powdery mildew

1996
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:11,279
in a crop I cut the crop down I clean

1997
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:11,279
the room I start over and figure out why

1998
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:18,039
I think about Doug before I apply

1999
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:19,899
anything every I research I try to be

2000
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:21,399
good to myself I try to be good to Doug

2001
01:25:19,899 --> 01:25:23,439
I try to be good to anybody else it's

2002
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:24,789
gonna smoke this stuff or eat this stuff

2003
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:28,029
or make cash out of this stuff because

2004
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:29,800
it's going into a sick person's body we

2005
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:33,909
don't want to kill them we want to make

2006
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:35,170
them feel better so a lot of people I

2007
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:36,819
wrote this down a lot of people are

2008
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,960
gonna have the excuse of it they didn't

2009
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:40,630
know they were using some dangerous

2010
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,300
pesticides like I said earlier as a

2011
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:45,510
grower that is your responsibility

2012
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:47,440
you're supposed to read every bottle

2013
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:48,970
everything that you when you go to the

2014
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,619
grocery you should have already read

2015
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:53,500
about that product before you bought it

2016
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:54,760
today read every bottle and then go if

2017
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,890
you don't know what that one ingredient

2018
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,869
is if you don't know what spinosad is if

2019
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,670
you heard me recommend spinosad to get

2020
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:02,529
rid of white flies on the show if you

2021
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,569
don't know what that is before you spray

2022
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:05,739
go read what that [ __ ] is and understand

2023
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:07,329
what you're spraying on your plants

2024
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:09,069
that's your responsibility as a grower

2025
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,779
you should have read every bottle you

2026
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:11,920
should have researched everything so

2027
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:14,019
that you know what you're putting into

2028
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,720
yourself and so that you know what you

2029
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:18,670
are giving to sick and this counts even

2030
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,110
if it's a commercial or a recreational

2031
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:22,779
grow because you don't know where that

2032
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:24,460
product is going to end up you have no

2033
01:26:22,779 --> 01:26:26,539
idea who's gonna be smoking it we don't

2034
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:29,250
want to make more people more sick

2035
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:30,659
let's work on healing people you guys be

2036
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,619
more responsible with your grows please

2037
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:33,090

2038
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,949

2070
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:57,329
is a live broadcast and then the video

2071
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:58,770
stays up for 24 hours unless I said

2072
01:27:57,329 --> 01:28:01,590
something stupid and then I go delete

2073
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:02,670

2077
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:09,590
to the point to this next topic here

2078
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:15,459
all right big shout out to root beer

2079
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:17,708
alright this next topic is carbon

2080
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:20,130
filters like I was saying my friend sent

2081
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:23,438
me an email asking about carbon filters

2082
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:25,630
let me start off by saying that the

2083
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,399
information that you sent me you had an

2084
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:30,130
idea of which carbon filter you wanted

2085
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:31,780
you have chosen the right filter that's

2086
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:34,059
what I think from the info that you gave

2087
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:51,009
me you were talking about getting the 13

2088
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:52,630
inch tall with either let's talk a

2089
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:55,269
little bit about selecting the carbon

2090
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:56,769
filter you guys first of all I should

2091
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,439
explain to you what a carbon filter is

2092
01:28:56,769 --> 01:29:00,849
maybe you're new maybe you're not

2093
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:03,969
familiar a carbon filter is what we use

2094
01:29:00,849 --> 01:29:06,189
to take the air to take the smell out of

2095
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:08,408
the air if the air is leaving your grow

2096
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:10,749
room it's gonna stink like crazy if you

2097
01:29:08,408 --> 01:29:15,688
have flowering plants you have a blower

2098
01:29:10,748 --> 01:29:15,688
or an inline fan blowing air out of your

2099
01:29:17,849 --> 01:29:22,569
get some fresh air in there when you're

2100
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:24,849
blowing that old air out it is going to

2101
01:29:22,569 --> 01:29:27,368
smell like cannabis it's gonna stink

2102
01:29:24,849 --> 01:29:28,659
like a skunk or fruit or berries it's

2103
01:29:27,368 --> 01:29:38,348
gonna stink if you're doing it right so

2104
01:29:28,658 --> 01:29:41,679
the carbon filter passes through the

2105
01:29:38,349 --> 01:29:44,469
carbon filter will be cleaned the carbon

2106
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,449
filters a cylinder with activated

2107
01:29:44,469 --> 01:29:50,649
charcoal in it connects to your inline

2108
01:29:46,448 --> 01:29:52,569
fan and then it blows air through the

2109
01:29:50,649 --> 01:29:54,369
carbon filter first and then you can do

2110
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:56,498
inline fan or ducting however you choose

2111
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:58,978
but then you go out of your Dro area and

2112
01:29:56,498 --> 01:30:01,630
the air goes through the carbon filter

2113
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:04,659
has all the contaminants removed and

2114
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:06,939
those contaminants include the odor so

2115
01:30:04,658 --> 01:30:09,549
that's basically the stone version of

2116
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:11,530
what a carbon filter is a cylinder with

2117
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:13,630
activated quartz charcoal the connects

2118
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:16,670
to your inline fan as air goes through

2119
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:18,920
it it removes contaminated

2120
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:21,380
so now we'll talk a little bit about how

2121
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,550
to select your carbon filter is this is

2122
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:25,069
the part that our friend needed health

2123
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:26,869
with the goal of your carbon filter and

2124
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:30,019
your blower in your room is to exchange

2125
01:30:26,869 --> 01:30:32,199
the air in your grow room every one to

2126
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,190
three minutes for best odor control

2127
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:36,739
because what that means is you want to

2128
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:38,239
take all of the air out of your room if

2129
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:40,010
you don't want to empty it then refill

2130
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:42,619
it of course you want to be sucking air

2131
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:45,320
out of the room and refilling every one

2132
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:47,630
to three minutes all right you want to

2133
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:49,399
get the air completely exchanged every

2134
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:51,350
two to three minutes or twenty to thirty

2135
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:54,379
times an hour inch for best motor

2136
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:58,039
control so to do that you need to find

2137
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:59,930
the cubic volume of the room and to do

2138
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:02,539
that you measure length times width

2139
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:05,329
times height all right and that will EQ

2140
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:06,859
equal the cubic volume of the room once

2141
01:31:05,329 --> 01:31:09,680
you know the cubic volume of your room

2142
01:31:06,859 --> 01:31:12,439
then you need to get an inline fan that

2143
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:15,320
will pull that volume of air twenty to

2144
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:17,210
thirty times per hour through your room

2145
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:19,460
and then you'll find a carbon filter

2146
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:21,800
that matches that and that's easy

2147
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:24,020
because the alright what you need to do

2148
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,329
you'll find the cubic volume of the room

2149
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:28,970
right I'm gonna make up a room this room

2150
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:30,859
is twelve by twelve that's got a twelve

2151
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:32,750
by twelve footprint with an eight-foot

2152
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:38,210
ceiling right so that I did the math

2153
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:41,720
that comes out to 1152 cubic feet for

2154
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:45,350
that's the cubic volume of the room so

2155
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:50,449
you want a blower ideally it would pool

2156
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:52,880
it would have a CFM rating of 1152 or

2157
01:31:50,449 --> 01:31:55,250
close to that if you go look at the

2158
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:59,119
vortex fan they actually sell one it is

2159
01:31:55,250 --> 01:32:01,880
an 1140 CFM so I would use that on

2160
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,590
either a 6 or an 8 inch duct that's what

2161
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,630
I would recommend and then you would

2162
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:08,449
want to find a carbon filter that is

2163
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:10,310
rated for the same amount of CFM's they

2164
01:32:08,449 --> 01:32:12,229
come in ranges so you're gonna need a

2165
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:18,830
carbon filter that is able to scrub

2166
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:22,279
about 1152 cubic feet of volume in your

2167
01:32:18,829 --> 01:32:26,239
room would be ideal you can go half of

2168
01:32:22,279 --> 01:32:27,889
that which is about 576 but you don't

2169
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:30,029
want to go much lower than that if you

2170
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,800
point to a third of that

2171
01:32:30,029 --> 01:32:33,149
you're looking in the three Hades and

2172
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:36,840
you're not gonna be pulling enough

2173
01:32:33,149 --> 01:32:38,158
humidity out that way and it's you may

2174
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,630
get the smell out that way but you're

2175
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:40,888
not gonna be cooling the room and you're

2176
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:43,139
definitely not gonna remove enough

2177
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:45,779
humidity of [ __ ] so I'd recommend going

2178
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:49,469
five seventy-five to like eleven fifty

2179
01:32:45,779 --> 01:32:51,840
two maybe of 1200 at the max but that's

2180
01:32:49,469 --> 01:32:53,368
how you need to select your blower a

2181
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,529
blowers that is going to pull the

2182
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:57,149
appropriate amount of air and then the

2183
01:32:55,529 --> 01:33:00,149
carbon filter will follow the blower

2184
01:32:57,149 --> 01:33:02,009
make sure you get the right size flange

2185
01:33:00,149 --> 01:33:04,439
on there they come in anywhere from a

2186
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:12,929
four all the way up to I think a sixteen

2187
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:15,000
as I've seen in use but so once you find

2188
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:17,730
your carbon filter that matches your

2189
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,340
blower I would recommend that you hate

2190
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:22,948
the carbon filter as high as you can in

2191
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,860
the room hanging up as high as you can

2192
01:33:22,948 --> 01:33:27,658
because heat rises you want to keep your

2193
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:29,158
air conditioned air down low and you

2194
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:31,710
want to keep your heat that's up top you

2195
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:33,238
want to suck that out make sure you guys

2196
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,099
change out the carbon filter remember

2197
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:37,529
they don't last more than a year maybe

2198
01:33:35,099 --> 01:33:40,828
two some of them are rechargeable but

2199
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:42,868
from what I have found it's actually

2200
01:33:40,828 --> 01:33:45,868
much cheaper to just go buy a new one

2201
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:47,698
the hard part is finding an economical

2202
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:49,920
or not economical and environmentally

2203
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:51,359
friendly way to get rid of your old

2204
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,219
carbon filter if you guys have any

2205
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,238
suggestions on that you can send me an

2206
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:54,989
email score from your heart at

2207
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:56,729
hotmail.com

2208
01:33:54,988 --> 01:33:59,669
I would love to share that information

2209
01:33:56,729 --> 01:34:01,558
on the show if somebody to dispose of

2210
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:03,149
their carbon filter more properly I've

2211
01:34:01,559 --> 01:34:05,429
got a couple lined up in my garage that

2212
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:07,529
I don't know what to do with alright

2213
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:09,328
guys I hope that made sense that was my

2214
01:34:07,529 --> 01:34:13,828
very quick lesson on how to select a

2215
01:34:09,328 --> 01:34:16,170
carbon filter a carbon filter from the

2216
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:19,078
roof from the ceiling I mean make sure

2217
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:22,288
you do it smartly wisely my grammar is

2218
01:34:19,078 --> 01:34:24,689
terrible today make sure you use a stud

2219
01:34:22,288 --> 01:34:27,300
and not like a guy like myself or Jessi

2220
01:34:24,689 --> 01:34:29,098
make sure you find a beam in the room

2221
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:30,389
just do everything smart don't destroy

2222
01:34:29,099 --> 01:34:32,610
the house don't hurt yourself especially

2223
01:34:30,389 --> 01:34:34,500
hanging a forty pound fifty pound carbon

2224
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:35,788
filter above your head that [ __ ] could

2225
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,020
fall I don't want it to break you I

2226
01:34:35,788 --> 01:34:38,939
don't want it to break your plants I

2227
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,920
love you guys I would miss you if you

2228
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:42,159
quit listening definitely hate it if you

2229
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,380
hurt yourself

2230
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:45,789
careful safety first since I'm talking

2231
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:47,440
about that here's a piece of advice that

2232
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:49,779
I don't talk about often enough somebody

2233
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:51,639
was like hey bro if you could put like

2234
01:34:49,779 --> 01:34:53,289
one or two essential pieces of gear and

2235
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,520
a grow roof that I may have overlooked

2236
01:34:53,289 --> 01:34:57,100
what would they be you know what I told

2237
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,750
him I sent a fire extinguisher on the

2238
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,940
outside of the room right outside the

2239
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:04,090
door and a smoke alarm inside of the

2240
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:07,019
room that's something I definitely

2241
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:10,720
recommend go to smoke alarm in there

2242
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:11,800
outside of the residential grow because

2243
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,840
you don't want to have to run in the

2244
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,310
grow room to find the fire extinguisher

2245
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,100
in the worst-case scenario you want it

2246
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:19,360
right outside to kick open the door

2247
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,370
start spraying if that's what needs to

2248
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:23,710
be done I hope that never has to happen

2249
01:35:21,369 --> 01:35:25,149
for you guys but I hope you do have a

2250
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:26,890
fire extinguisher in the case that you

2251
01:35:25,149 --> 01:35:36,399

2252
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:39,100
to give you some heads-up we've been

2253
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:41,379
going just about almost 27 minutes I

2254
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:43,300
feel like if I start doing the closing

2255
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:45,489
now we should wrap up right on time for

2256
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,930

2257

appreciate it you've been listening to

2258
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:51,310

2259
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:53,380
whole lot more than you did those 45 and

2260
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:55,660
hour-long shows I feel like a lot of you

2261
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:57,190
pot smokers have a TD or maybe you just

2262
01:35:55,659 --> 01:35:59,559

2263

episode and I can see who cuts I can't

2266
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,460
see who but I can see that a lot of the

2267
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:08,289
listeners cut out at certain times so

2268
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,609
I've learned is it about 36 minutes is

2269
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:12,670
your attention span so I try to keep

2270
01:36:09,609 --> 01:36:14,289
them about 36 minutes 40 at the most but

2271
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:15,640

so I'll tell you what I'm talking about

2450
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,069
unfortunately a couple of weeks ago a

2451
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:00,440
good friend of mine by the name of Brian

2452
01:45:58,069 --> 01:46:03,469
Richie he passed away he left this earth

2453
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:06,109
and he left us a little saddened Brian

2454
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:07,880
was a great musician Brian is probably

2455
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:09,679
oh let's see

2456
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:12,650
Brian was probably close to 40 years

2457
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:15,590
older than me pretty close 35 to 40

2458
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:17,359
years older than myself and I met Brian

2459
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:19,190
I was a musician just starting out I was

2460
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:20,539
playing in a club and Brian saw me play

2461
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:22,848
and he said young man you've got a gift

2462
01:46:20,539 --> 01:46:24,829
and my band needs a drummer and I'd like

2463
01:46:22,849 --> 01:46:26,060
you to play with us and you know this

2464
01:46:24,829 --> 01:46:27,500
old guy approaches me and asked me to

2465
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:28,550
play I kind of thought I don't want to

2466
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,529
play with a bunch of old guys I'm a

2467
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:32,029
young rock star but for some reason I

2468
01:46:30,529 --> 01:46:33,289
did it something in my heart said you

2469
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:35,269
should go play with these old guys and

2470
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:37,099
see what they're doing and until I

2471
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:39,110
played with them I was not a drummer I

2472
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:42,079
was a guy with a drum set that was

2473
01:46:39,109 --> 01:46:44,059
hitting drums with my friends um Brian

2474
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:47,510
and the band I joined with Brian turned

2475
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:50,150
me into a musician I was not a musician

2476
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:52,520
until that point um Brian gave me

2477
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:55,069
musical career advice Brian gave me

2478
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:57,409
stage advice Brian taught me a lot about

2479
01:46:55,069 --> 01:47:00,799
being a professional musician Brian took

2480
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,170
me out of the bar mentality of playing

2481
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,029
as a bar musician just playing for free

2482
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:07,099
beer trying to be a rock star he put me

2483
01:47:05,029 --> 01:47:09,349
in the mentality and mindset of a

2484
01:47:07,099 --> 01:47:11,569
working drummer and I will never forget

2485
01:47:09,349 --> 01:47:15,739
that so I'm always grateful to Brian

2486
01:47:11,569 --> 01:47:17,868
Richie for the what did he see in me he

2487
01:47:15,738 --> 01:47:20,149
had confidence in me he had faith in me

2488
01:47:17,868 --> 01:47:21,738
and he saw that and he put me behind the

2489
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:24,229
drums in his band when I wasn't ready

2490
01:47:21,738 --> 01:47:25,579
and let me earn my position there and I

2491
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:27,198
worked hard to be the drummer that he

2492
01:47:25,579 --> 01:47:29,359
needed so I've been going on for a long

2493
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:31,098
time about it but Brian I miss you bro

2494
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:32,598
thanks for what you did to my musical

2495
01:47:31,099 --> 01:47:35,449
career thanks for what he did to my

2496
01:47:32,599 --> 01:47:37,460
mindset as a musician now what I'm

2497
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:40,039
getting to a Saturday we threw a giant

2498
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:42,020
party Brian didn't want a funeral they

2499
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:44,599
didn't want sadness but I thought that

2500
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:47,570
it was my duty to throw a party for the

2501
01:47:44,599 --> 01:47:49,670
man and get all of our favorite mutual

2502

all of the people in the dispensary like

2549
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,010
[ __ ]

2550
01:49:23,159 --> 01:49:28,050
once the dispensary was emptied of

2551
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:30,480
people they took down all the cameras

2552
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:32,610
and then they began to they proceeded to

2553
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:34,979
destroy this dispensary

the safes they caused the water damage

2557
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:44,850
to the displays and then these police

2558
01:49:41,819 --> 01:49:47,670
officers had the audacity to eat edibles

2559

they were eating edibles

2565
01:49:55,739 --> 01:49:59,969
they were playing darts and they were

2566
01:49:57,329 --> 01:50:02,659

2568
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:08,130
discovered the video and filed a lawsuit

2569
01:50:05,579 --> 01:50:11,159
against specific law enforcement

2570
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:13,619
officers now here is where we are today

2571
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:16,559
here's an article that I found on

2572
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:19,140
reason.com written by Jacob Solem and

2573
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,700
the headline says suspended cops say

2574
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:24,270
video of them eating marijuana edibles

2575
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:26,069
during a raid violated their privacy the

2576
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:27,480
sub headline is Santa Ana officers want

2577
01:50:26,069 --> 01:50:30,029
to stop their department from using the

2578
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:31,379
footage to investigate them I'm gonna go

2579
01:50:30,029 --> 01:50:33,479
ahead and read you the article it says

2580
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:35,039
remember the Santa Ana California cops

2581
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:37,049
who were caught on video munching on

2582
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:38,970
what seems to be cannister cannabis

2583
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:39,719
infused chocolate bars after raiding an

2584
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:41,880
unlicensed

2585
01:50:39,719 --> 01:50:43,380
medical marijuana dispensary in may the

2586
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:45,179
Orange County Register reports that

2587
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:46,739
three officers who were suspended after

2588
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:49,019
the incident are trying to stop the

2589
01:50:46,738 --> 01:50:50,339
Santa Ana Police Department from using

2590
01:50:49,019 --> 01:50:52,800
the footage in its internal

2591
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,690
investigation among other things their

2592
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,460
lawsuit argues that the officers thought

2593
01:50:54,689 --> 01:50:58,018
they had disabled all of the security

2594
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:00,479
cameras at sky high holistic and

2595
01:50:58,019 --> 01:51:02,729
therefore had a reasonable expectation

2596
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,650
of privacy the cops complained that the

2597
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:06,900
dispensary never got their permission to

2598
01:51:04,649 --> 01:51:11,879
record them as they searched the

2599
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:14,069
premises so these cops are trying to

2600
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,380
stop this video from being used in court

2601
01:51:14,069 --> 01:51:18,689
because they were illegally recorded

2602
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:21,118
because since they had destroyed all of

2603
01:51:18,689 --> 01:51:24,058
the security cameras they therefore had

2604
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:25,729
a reasonable expectation of privacy now

2605
01:51:24,059 --> 01:51:28,340
that means

2606
01:51:25,729 --> 01:51:32,419
that if I break into your house and you

2607
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:34,039
film me [ __ ] your film because I had an

2608
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:35,470
expectation of privacy while I broke

2609
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:38,479
into your house and stole all your [ __ ]

2610
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:39,860
that's what these cops are saying it's a

2611
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:41,959
two-way street I don't think that a rule

2612
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:43,880
works just for cops that doesn't work

2613
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:44,899
for civilians right these cops are

2614
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:46,640
trying to pull some [ __ ] I'm gonna keep

2615
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:48,799
reading here it says all police print

2616
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:50,900
all police personnel present had a

2617
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,279
reasonable expectation that their

2618
01:51:50,899 --> 01:51:54,409
conversations were no longer being

2619
01:51:52,279 --> 01:51:55,609
recorded and the undercover officer is

2620
01:51:54,409 --> 01:51:57,920
feeling that they were safe to do so

2621
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:59,509
remove their masks says the complaint

2622
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,730
which was filed in Orange County

2623
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:03,050
Superior Court without the illegal

2624
01:52:01,729 --> 01:52:05,119
recordings there would have been no

2625
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:07,699
internal investigation of any officer

2626
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:09,800
under California law all parties to a

2627
01:52:07,699 --> 01:52:11,659
confidential communication must consent

2628
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:13,520
to being recorded but that rule does not

2629
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:15,619
apply when the parties to the

2630
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,780
communication may reasonably expect that

2631
01:52:15,619 --> 01:52:19,880
the communication may be overheard or

2632
01:52:17,779 --> 01:52:22,189
recorded in an interview with the

2633
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:23,720
register Sky's lawyer Matthew Pappas

2634
01:52:22,189 --> 01:52:25,250
noted that police routinely used

2635
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:27,440
surveillance camera video against

2636
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:29,510
suspects it's pretty pathetic for police

2637
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:31,219
to say if we don't like something that

2638
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:33,020
it can be used then it can't be used as

2639
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:35,270
evidence he said they knew they were on

2640
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:38,890
video just because they messed missed

2641
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:41,080
one camera doesn't make it illegal

2642
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:43,030
I think we all agree here that this is

2643
01:52:41,079 --> 01:52:45,430
complete [ __ ] because if you were I

2644
01:52:43,029 --> 01:52:47,619
were caught doing something on a film no

2645
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:49,750
matter how that film was made that film

2646
01:52:47,619 --> 01:52:52,149
would be used against us in a court of

2647
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:54,399
law that film would probably be edited

2648
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:56,679
by the opposing lawyers to make us look

2649
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:58,869
like a pile of [ __ ] so I think that this

2650
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:02,500
videotape should definitely be used in a

2651
01:52:58,869 --> 01:53:04,750
court of law these people in my opinion

2652
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:06,399
they illegally [ __ ] attacked if you

2653
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,979
know more about the story these people

2654
01:53:06,399 --> 01:53:11,500
illegally singled out this dispensary so

2655
01:53:08,979 --> 01:53:13,779
I hope that this video is used in court

2656
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:16,090
if not there are bigger problems in

2657
01:53:13,779 --> 01:53:17,739
America than we knew about I'm gonna

2658
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:20,050
give a huge shout out to reason.com

2659
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:22,510
and also a big shout-out to Jacobs Solem

2660
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:24,699
alright you guys my friend Fred Garvin

2661
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:26,289
recently sent me an e-mail or was a

2662
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:27,699
Facebook message and it said I don't

2663
01:53:26,289 --> 01:53:29,739
remember exactly what it said I'm gonna

2664
01:53:27,699 --> 01:53:31,659
kind of miss quote him ridiculously but

2665
01:53:29,739 --> 01:53:33,010
he said hey Jeff used to do a bunch of

2666
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:34,899
girl lessons that was what the show is

2667
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:36,970
about and recently you were not doing

2668
01:53:34,899 --> 01:53:38,710
grow lessons what the hell happened Fred

2669
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:40,420
I agree with you I've responded to you

2670
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:42,760
on Facebook I addressed this on the last

2671
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:44,770
podcast I completely agree with you Fred

2672
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:46,690
I need to get back to the grow lessons

2673
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:49,120
so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

2674
01:53:46,689 --> 01:53:51,549
take a phat dab and then I will be right

2675
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:54,489
back and we will talk about the

2676
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:55,779
importance of pH in your plants so hang

2677
01:53:54,489 --> 01:53:57,849
on for just one second you guys I'm

2678
01:53:55,779 --> 01:54:00,369
gonna take a DAB maybe get a drink and I

2679
01:53:57,850 --> 01:54:01,990
will be right back all right you guys I

2680
01:54:00,369 --> 01:54:03,880
am back after a couple of dabs and I am

2681
01:54:01,989 --> 01:54:07,059
feeling great now it's time to talk

2682
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:08,260
about pH a little bit um I've got a few

2683
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,760
notes here I'm gonna try to skim through

2684
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:11,230
these without sounding like I'm reading

2685
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,030
too much but I needed some notes to keep

2686
01:54:11,229 --> 01:54:15,219
myself on track because this has a lot

2687
01:54:13,029 --> 01:54:17,829
of numbers and a lot of important things

2688
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:19,900
that we need to pay attention to so

2689
01:54:17,829 --> 01:54:21,579
let's get into it a little bit properly

2690
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:23,289
properly adjusting the pH of your

2691
01:54:21,579 --> 01:54:25,059
nutrient solution can solve a lot of

2692
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:27,939
problems and it can greatly improve the

2693
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:30,910
quality of your crop I still do a little

2694
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:33,039
bit of consulting and I really see a lot

2695
01:54:30,909 --> 01:54:35,229
of people overlooking the pH of their

2696
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:38,050
nutrient solution and how important it

2697
01:54:35,229 --> 01:54:40,029
is to adjust the pH of their nutrient

2698
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:42,159
solution before they feed their plants

2699
01:54:40,029 --> 01:54:44,319
these guys have a lot of problems in

2700
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:46,239
their gardens that look like nutrient

2701
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:48,969
deficiencies and I see them trying to

2702
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:51,849
correct nutrient deficiencies like a lot

2703
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:53,020
of times a pH imbalance will just will

2704
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:55,660
look like

2705
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:59,140
Fache itself as maybe a cal-mag problem

2706
01:54:55,659 --> 01:55:01,059
or maybe a phosphorus overload but a lot

2707
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:03,369
of times it's just a simple pH problem

2708
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:06,160
they could have been solved by adjusting

2709
01:55:03,369 --> 01:55:08,800
the pH of your nutrient solution before

2710
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:11,170
you fed it to your plants um a lot of

2711
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,430
people will talk about soil pH a lot of

2712
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:14,170
people are gonna talk about different

2713
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:17,289
areas of pH what I'm going to talk about

2714
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:20,079
is the pH balance of your nutrient

2715
01:55:17,289 --> 01:55:23,560
solution whether it be soil or hydro if

2716
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:26,859
you're working in soil the optimum pH

2717
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:31,060
range for your soil garden is about 5.5

2718
01:55:26,859 --> 01:55:32,949
to 6.5 if you were working in hydro your

2719
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:37,150
optimum range is going to be similar

2720
01:55:32,949 --> 01:55:38,529
between 5 8 and 6.2 now you keep hearing

2721
01:55:37,149 --> 01:55:42,189
me say that we need to be within a

2722
01:55:38,529 --> 01:55:44,050
certain pH range it would be ideal to

2723
01:55:42,189 --> 01:55:45,909
find a certain number and stick with it

2724
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:48,940
is what most folks would think but the

2725
01:55:45,909 --> 01:55:51,220
reason we need a pH range is because

2726
01:55:48,939 --> 01:55:53,079
some nutrients that we're feeding our

2727
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:54,570
plants some of the elements that our

2728
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:57,970
plants are trying to absorb are

2729
01:55:54,569 --> 01:56:00,069
available at certain pH levels and some

2730
01:55:57,970 --> 01:56:03,039
are available at different pH levels so

2731
01:56:00,069 --> 01:56:04,689
I'm gonna pick like in soil nitrogen is

2732
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:06,460
available and pretty either pretty much

2733
01:56:04,689 --> 01:56:08,529
suck up nitrogen at any point let's look

2734
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:11,649
at iron iron is more available on the

2735
01:56:08,529 --> 01:56:15,880
lower side of the pH scale the 3.5 range

2736
01:56:11,649 --> 01:56:17,439
the 3.5 to about 6.5 is where you're

2737
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:19,630
gonna pick up iron but if you get any

2738
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:21,879
higher on the pH range you stop

2739
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:24,730
absorbing the iron so then we're gonna

2740
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:28,029
look at calcium calcium doesn't absorb

2741
01:56:24,729 --> 01:56:31,329
very well in the 5.0 range but it does

2742
01:56:28,029 --> 01:56:34,000
start picking up at 5.5 to 6.5 you can

2743
01:56:31,329 --> 01:56:37,720
really absorb calcium but if you go out

2744
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:40,960
toward the 7.5 range you stop picking up

2745
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:44,079
calcium so these nutrients have a window

2746
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:46,569
where the pH is ideal for the plant to

2747
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:50,019
absorb each nutrient and we have found

2748
01:56:46,569 --> 01:56:52,569
that in soil somewhere between 5 5 &amp; 6 5

2749
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:54,790
is when all of these nutrients become

2750
01:56:52,569 --> 01:56:56,739
available at the same time ideally and

2751
01:56:54,789 --> 01:56:58,420
in Hydra like we said earlier it's five

2752
01:56:56,739 --> 01:57:00,760
point eight to six point two where these

2753
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:02,470
nutrients become available and let me

2754
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,720
tell you that the graph on the hydro

2755
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:05,640
side is much smaller you have a much

2756
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:08,789
more narrow

2757
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:11,940
window of nutrient availability due to

2758
01:57:08,789 --> 01:57:13,199
pH I know that's a lot to absorb but

2759
01:57:11,939 --> 01:57:15,119
once it's clicks in it'll definitely

2760
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:16,409
make sense to you let me try to explain

2761
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:18,269
it like this a little bit when it's

2762
01:57:16,409 --> 01:57:20,340
really hot outside you don't want hot

2763
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:22,410
cocoa but when it's really cold outside

2764
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:23,940
you do and then when it's really cold

2765
01:57:22,409 --> 01:57:26,130
outside you don't want ice cream but

2766
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:27,989
when it's warm outside you want ice

2767
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:30,000
cream so what we got to do we got to

2768
01:57:27,989 --> 01:57:31,859
find that perfect day where you can have

2769
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,779
hot cocoa for breakfast and you can have

2770
01:57:31,859 --> 01:57:34,889
ice cream for lunch and that's what

2771
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:36,479
we're trying to do for the plants by

2772
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:38,010
finding the perfect pH range we're

2773
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:39,539
trying to find that optimum spot where

2774
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:41,130
they're in the mood for all of the

2775
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:42,390
nutrients we're feeding them all right

2776
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:46,079
now we should probably talk about what

2777
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:47,789
pH actually is and stands for pH means

2778
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:50,309
potential hydrogen it's written with a

2779
01:57:47,789 --> 01:57:53,399
lowercase P and a capital H and what pH

2780
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:57,210
is is the measure of acid to alkalinity

2781
01:57:53,399 --> 01:58:00,299
in our nutrient solution pH is measured

2782
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:02,939
on a scale of zero to fourteen zero is

2783
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,560
the most acidic seven is neutral which

2784
01:58:02,939 --> 01:58:07,500
means there's an equal concentration of

2785
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:10,650
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions and then

2786
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:12,899
fourteen is pure alkali and it's done

2787
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:15,089
it's measured on what is called a love

2788
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:16,379
the I always [ __ ] this weird word up you

2789
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:19,230
only have to say it in this instance

2790
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:21,270
it's a logarithmic scale which means

2791
01:58:19,229 --> 01:58:27,538
that every one point increase or

2792
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:31,079
decrease in pH reflects a tenfold change

2793
01:58:27,538 --> 01:58:34,380
an acid or alkaline so in a solution

2794
01:58:31,078 --> 01:58:36,569
that's pH 5 that solution is 10 times

2795
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:39,210
more acidic than a solution that is pH

2796
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:42,630
at 6 so if you've got something that's

2797
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:44,908
pH D at 4 is going to be 1,000 times

2798
01:58:42,630 --> 01:58:47,159
more acidic than a solution that's pH at

2799
01:58:44,908 --> 01:58:49,170
6 so keep that in mind when you guys are

2800
01:58:47,158 --> 01:58:50,189
using your pH pen that's something that

2801
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:52,109
we'll talk about here in just a little

2802
01:58:50,189 --> 01:58:54,569
bit using your pH pen and your pH meter

2803
01:58:52,109 --> 01:58:56,339
you have to be really on the money when

2804
01:58:54,569 --> 01:58:58,078
you're adjusting your pH once you find

2805
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,279
once you found that range that your

2806
01:58:58,078 --> 01:59:00,779
plants really like you're gonna want to

2807
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:04,139
try to set it right about there all the

2808
01:59:00,779 --> 01:59:06,328
time so if you're using soil somewhere

2809
01:59:04,139 --> 01:59:09,090
within that 5-8 to 65 if you're in hydro

2810
01:59:06,328 --> 01:59:11,788
somewhere in that 5 6-2 6-3 range you're

2811
01:59:09,090 --> 01:59:13,590
gonna want to get your pH set and then

2812
01:59:11,788 --> 01:59:15,328
keep an eye on the plants and then pay

2813
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:16,409
attention to where it the plants each

2814
01:59:15,328 --> 01:59:18,029
strain is gonna be a little different

2815
01:59:16,408 --> 01:59:20,698
you guys pay attention to where each

2816
01:59:18,029 --> 01:59:22,259
strain likes that [ __ ] pH set and try

2817
01:59:20,698 --> 01:59:25,678
to get it there every time and take

2818
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:29,280
notes and keep in mind that point one on

2819
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:31,260
there is a huge difference in your pH so

2820
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:32,819
you can't just say I'm close enough you

2821
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:34,590
got to get it close and we'll talk about

2822
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:37,170
how to adjust the pH and measure that

2823
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:39,869
here pretty soon so also you guys keep

2824
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:41,849
in mind if you're running hydro your pH

2825
01:59:39,868 --> 01:59:44,038
is gonna change possibly every day

2826
01:59:41,849 --> 01:59:46,409
because you're going to have nutrients

2827
01:59:44,038 --> 01:59:48,538
absorbed by the plants you're going to

2828
01:59:46,408 --> 01:59:51,179
have water evaporate there are going to

2829
01:59:48,538 --> 01:59:52,800
be so many things that happen causing

2830
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:56,099
your pH to change that you're gonna have

2831
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:58,199
to be on that in hydro in soil you're

2832
01:59:56,099 --> 02:00:00,150
just gonna mix up the bucket I at the

2833
01:59:58,198 --> 02:00:02,178
end before you feed it to the plants you

2834
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:04,319
will test it and then you will adjust it

2835
02:00:02,179 --> 02:00:05,368
alright actually seems like I'm getting

2836
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:08,069
to the part where I should start

2837
02:00:05,368 --> 02:00:11,279
explaining how to pH test your water and

2838
02:00:08,069 --> 02:00:14,908
then how to correct the pH so let's get

2839
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,889
into that a little bit here um first I

2840
02:00:14,908 --> 02:00:18,238
would if you're mixing a hydro kit go

2841
02:00:16,889 --> 02:00:21,090
ahead and mix it in your reservoir fill

2842
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:23,368
it up - excuse me fill up your resin

2843
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:24,690
with water however you normally do it to

2844
02:00:23,368 --> 02:00:26,880
the recommended amount if you have a 25

2845
02:00:24,689 --> 02:00:28,348
gallon rez go ahead and do 25 gallons if

2846
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:30,029
you're doing a hydro kit if you're doing

2847
02:00:28,349 --> 02:00:31,800
soil and you do five-gallon buckets or

2848
02:00:30,029 --> 02:00:32,969
you got a big rez fill that up however

2849
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,070
you normally would with the amount you

2850
02:00:32,969 --> 02:00:36,420
normally would then mix in your

2851
02:00:35,069 --> 02:00:38,189
nutrients just like you normally would

2852
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:39,538
I'm gonna give a shout-out to my buddy

2853
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:41,079
John he taught me something and I don't

2854
02:00:39,538 --> 02:00:42,670
know how fallow this is but it made

2855
02:00:41,079 --> 02:00:45,460
it's John says if you're using potassium

2856
02:00:42,670 --> 02:00:48,670
silicates pour that in your water very

2857
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,930
first he had a good sound reason one day

2858
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:51,730
we'll get John on the show and he can

2859
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:53,980
explain why John says pour your

2860
02:00:51,729 --> 02:00:56,199
potassium silicates then if you're gonna

2861
02:00:53,979 --> 02:00:58,119
use cal-mag do your cal mag next and

2862
02:00:56,199 --> 02:01:01,539
then do all of your other nutrients

2863
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:03,279
after that um his reasoning made sense

2864
02:01:01,539 --> 02:01:05,019
and i don't want to try to butcher the

2865
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:06,729
reason that he told me so one day we'll

2866
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:08,430
get John on the show to talk about it if

2867
02:01:06,729 --> 02:01:10,659
you're a listener and you have a good

2868
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:12,610
example of why and you can explain it

2869
02:01:10,659 --> 02:01:13,689
send me an email and I would like to see

2870
02:01:12,609 --> 02:01:15,069
what you're thinking I want to see if

2871
02:01:13,689 --> 02:01:17,949
somebody else is on the same page as my

2872
02:01:15,069 --> 02:01:19,420
buddy John so fill your reservoir makes

2873
02:01:17,949 --> 02:01:21,489
your nutrients in there do your

2874
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:23,020
potassium silicon first then do your cal

2875
02:01:21,489 --> 02:01:27,010
mag then do the rest of your nutrients

2876
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:30,520
however you wish then um now is the time

2877
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:33,520
when you need to use a PHP or some type

2878
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:35,320
of pH meter or a pH probe and you need

2879
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:38,680
to stick that into this nutrient

2880
02:01:35,319 --> 02:01:40,960
solution and you need to see what the

2881
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:43,930
display says what the number reads on

2882
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:47,109
the display if you can't afford a pH pin

2883
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:50,320
or a pH meter you can use an aquarium

2884
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:52,210
test kit to tell you what the pH is they

2885
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:54,909
sell them at the aquarium shop you

2886
02:01:52,210 --> 02:01:57,310
probably pick it up at Walmart it's used

2887
02:01:54,909 --> 02:01:59,590
in a court in an aquarium environment to

2888
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:00,850
tell you what the pH of your aquarium

2889
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:03,159
water would be so that you don't kill

2890
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:05,170
your fish it'll do the exact same thing

2891
02:02:03,159 --> 02:02:06,670
we're just testing for pH here this

2892
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:08,289
stuff isn't going to go into your

2893
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:11,619
nutrient solution you'll take some water

2894
02:02:08,289 --> 02:02:13,510
out you will actually you'll dip this

2895
02:02:11,619 --> 02:02:14,979
strip into the water I don't even

2896
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:17,170
remember how to use the reagent should

2897
02:02:14,979 --> 02:02:18,579
it's been that long you put some water

2898
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:19,810
on it and then you drop these chemicals

2899
02:02:18,579 --> 02:02:21,309
on it and it shows you what color it is

2900
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:23,320
and you measure it up to the color and

2901
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:24,670
if it's like real blue then you're the

2902
02:02:23,319 --> 02:02:25,869
wrong way and if it's a real red you're

2903
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:27,550
the wrong way you want to get kind of in

2904
02:02:25,869 --> 02:02:28,689
the middle but those test strips they're

2905
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,980
kind of a pain in the ass you guys you

2906
02:02:28,689 --> 02:02:31,149
can tell about my description that's why

2907
02:02:29,979 --> 02:02:32,859
I haven't used it in years that's why

2908
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:35,139
I'll never use it again get yourself a

2909
02:02:32,859 --> 02:02:38,349
good pH pen or a pH meter

2910
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:40,600
um the Pens are way easier to use do not

2911
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:41,110
drop your pen in the water it'll be

2912
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:44,320
toast

2913
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:45,759
um keep your PIN calibrated if you don't

2914
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:47,229
know how to calibrate it take it to your

2915
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,800
local grower and they will probably

2916
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:50,939
calibrate it for you and after this

2917
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52,170
or fourth time they'll get tired of

2918
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:53,879
doing it and they will teach you how to

2919
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:55,680
do it just go ask him how to do it

2920
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:58,109
they'll calibrate your pH pin for you

2921
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:00,300
always keep no matter what type of pH

2922
02:02:58,109 --> 02:03:03,179
pin you're using always keep the probe

2923
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:05,130
the tip that white part in there always

2924
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:07,710
keep that way here's something to

2925
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:09,869
remember with a pH pin a pH tester a pH

2926
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:11,609
probe other than the reagent if you're

2927
02:03:09,869 --> 02:03:14,010
using the expensive any kind of pen that

2928
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:16,649
you dip in the water if it dries it dies

2929
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:18,810
that is the thing to remember if it

2930
02:03:16,649 --> 02:03:20,489
dries it dies keep your pH pin wet

2931
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:24,450
keep it calibrated keep it clean and

2932
02:03:20,489 --> 02:03:28,019
keep it handy all the time I myself I

2933
02:03:24,449 --> 02:03:30,689
use the blue lab three-in-one combo it's

2934
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:32,730
got a pH meter a ppm meter and a

2935
02:03:30,689 --> 02:03:34,589
temperature gauge on there that's called

2936
02:03:32,729 --> 02:03:36,479
a thermometer right yeah it's got that

2937
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:38,730
on there it's a three-in-one combo it's

2938
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:40,919
a little pricey if you can't afford that

2939
02:03:38,729 --> 02:03:43,199
get yourself you know those yellow

2940
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,579
Milwaukee's work that's you'll see that

2941
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:47,069
if you go to the grocery look for a pH

2942
02:03:44,579 --> 02:03:49,260
pin you'll see the yellow Milwaukee pH

2943
02:03:47,069 --> 02:03:51,000
meter that thing's a piece of [ __ ] but

2944
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:52,680
it will work it'll do what you need done

2945
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,420
I would recommend a better one if you

2946
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:56,970
can afford a more expensive higher

2947
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:58,560
quality pH meter I would go for it but

2948
02:03:56,970 --> 02:04:01,110
that little yellow Milwaukee piece of

2949
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,060
[ __ ] will work it will die on you soon

2950
02:04:01,109 --> 02:04:04,469
so be prepared to buy another one if you

2951
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:07,230
can get the next upgraded one whatever

2952
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:09,390
it is do that like I said I like blue

2953
02:04:07,229 --> 02:04:10,769
lab products my buddy John was telling

2954
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:12,720
me he likes another brand for some

2955
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:15,690
reason I stick with the blue lab I've

2956
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:18,449
never had any problems ah that's what I

2957
02:04:15,689 --> 02:04:21,119
would do so you stick the meter in there

2958
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:23,340
see you fill up your reservoir you mix

2959
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:24,930
your nutrients in the proper order you

2960
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:26,400
let it be it's gotta be at about room

2961
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:27,780
temperature you guys like you don't want

2962
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:31,319
your water too hot or too cold because

2963
02:04:27,779 --> 02:04:33,000
that will definitely affect the pH get

2964
02:04:31,319 --> 02:04:34,109
it at room temperature maybe set it in

2965
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,640
the grow room if it's coming out of the

2966
02:04:34,109 --> 02:04:36,869
faucet too hot or too cold go set in

2967
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:38,460
your grow room for a little while so

2968
02:04:36,869 --> 02:04:40,739
that it's the same temperature as your

2969
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:43,409
room then make sure nutrients into there

2970
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:46,679
I didn't put your pH meter in there it's

2971
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:49,260
gonna show a number hopefully most of

2972
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,550
tap water most municipal tap water comes

2973
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:52,289
out depending on where you are it's

2974
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:53,909
between 8 and 9 just depends on where

2975
02:04:52,289 --> 02:04:56,880
you are and that will change seasonally

2976
02:04:53,909 --> 02:04:58,979
you guys or when your local water

2977
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,630
company cleans their pipes or does some

2978
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:01,739
flushing or changes chemicals that they

2979
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:03,960
want to use

2980
02:05:01,739 --> 02:05:05,250
or it'll be seasonal for sure pay

2981
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:06,840
attention because in the summer and in

2982
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:09,270
the winter I can tell the huge

2983
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:10,949
difference in my water quality so pay

2984
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:12,300
attention to that test your water once

2985
02:05:10,949 --> 02:05:13,529
in a while just pour water out of the

2986
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:14,909
faucet let it get to room temperature

2987
02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:17,009
stick your pH probe in there and see

2988
02:05:14,909 --> 02:05:18,119
what it is occasionally just for fun you

2989
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:20,100
should always be testing everything

2990
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:21,329
that's going into your plants I'm always

2991
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:24,300
curious about what's going into my

2992
02:05:21,329 --> 02:05:26,250
plants so he makes your stuff up where

2993
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:27,449
the hell was I makes your stuff up stick

2994
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:27,930
your pH bin in there it's gonna show you

2995
02:05:27,449 --> 02:05:30,479
a number

2996
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:31,770
hopefully you're close you know what I

2997
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:33,839
mean you're usually once you've makes

2998
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:36,600
your nutrients you're hardly ever gonna

2999
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:37,949
need pH up if you need to put pH up in

3000
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,420
there you probably are mixing your

3001
02:05:37,949 --> 02:05:40,889
nutrients too strong you're probably

3002
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:42,300
using something you shouldn't be using

3003
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:44,789
you probably did something wrong

3004
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:46,739
probably there are some instances where

3005
02:05:44,789 --> 02:05:48,449
your pH will drop really low that's okay

3006
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:50,159
but you're gonna need to bring it back

3007
02:05:48,449 --> 02:05:53,069
up that doesn't happen very frequently

3008
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:55,019
um you're gonna be too high you're

3009
02:05:53,069 --> 02:05:56,489
probably gonna be once you mix up your

3010
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,920
nutrients you're probably gonna be about

3011
02:05:56,489 --> 02:06:00,960
7.2 you're gonna need to get that down

3012
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:03,300
closer to the 6.5 range if you're in

3013
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:07,170
soil if you're running hydro you want to

3014
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:09,539
get that down closer to like the 6.0

3015
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:12,630
kind of area I guess the way you're

3016
02:06:09,539 --> 02:06:15,390
gonna want to do that is slowly very

3017
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:17,250
slowly add your pH down just a little

3018
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:19,200
bit you guys don't get this [ __ ] in your

3019
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:21,630
eyes don't get it on your skin if you're

3020
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:23,010
new at this and you're intimidated or if

3021
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:24,420
you're a clumsy [ __ ] put on some

3022
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:26,250
gloves and put on some protective

3023
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:27,600
goggles I have a friend who was in

3024
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:29,640
Michigan I won't say his name cuz I

3025
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:32,760
don't want to embarrass you but my

3026
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:35,400
friend Jason he splashed some pH down

3027
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:38,039
into his eye just a little bit he said

3028
02:06:35,399 --> 02:06:40,019
he got a small drop of pH in his eye and

3029
02:06:38,039 --> 02:06:41,789
he said he went completely blind in that

3030
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:43,830
eye and he said it was so excruciating

3031
02:06:41,789 --> 02:06:46,979
that he couldn't open the other eye and

3032
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:47,760
he had to use Siri on his iPhone to call

3033
02:06:46,979 --> 02:06:50,250
911

3034
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,800
to come to his house and help him in his

3035
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:54,029
bro because he couldn't [ __ ] see so

3036
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,400
don't put yourself in that kind of

3037
02:06:54,029 --> 02:06:58,500
situation you guys be safe if you're

3038
02:06:56,399 --> 02:07:00,000
clumsy [ __ ] wear some goggles even if

3039
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:01,500
you're a pro it might be a good idea to

3040
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,210
wear some safety goggles or something

3041
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:06,180
when you're mixing this stuff the pH can

3042
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:07,529
real the pH adjusters can really really

3043
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:10,090
mess with your eyes and your skin if

3044
02:07:07,529 --> 02:07:12,250
they get on you and get in your eye so

3045
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:14,079
a little bit of pH down in there I would

3046
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:15,909
start with like five to ten milliliters

3047
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:17,680
that's five milliliters in a five-gallon

3048
02:07:15,909 --> 02:07:19,750
bucket is probably enough to drop your

3049
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:21,100
pH down where you need it drop that in

3050
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:23,680
there shake it up real good

3051
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:25,480
put your pH meter back in there and see

3052
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:27,640
what you're testing now you want to get

3053
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:28,750
it right on the money it's gonna you're

3054
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:30,970
gonna have to [ __ ] up a couple of

3055
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:33,010
batches you might have to use pH up and

3056
02:07:30,970 --> 02:07:35,020
down so many times that you just don't

3057
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:37,000
even want to use it because all the [ __ ]

3058
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:38,740
that you've just added to your your

3059
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,600
solution you got too much pH you up too

3060
02:07:38,739 --> 02:07:42,279
much pH down in there so you're gonna

3061
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:44,410
have to just pour that and start over

3062
02:07:42,279 --> 02:07:46,539
but don't be afraid that's how you're

3063
02:07:44,409 --> 02:07:48,760
gonna learn you guys that is how you are

3064
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:51,310
going to learn so add your pH up add

3065
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:53,470
your pH down whichever you need to do

3066
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:55,180
and then test it and once you've got it

3067
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:56,980
right where you want it go ahead and

3068
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:59,079
pour that water into your plants if it's

3069
02:07:56,979 --> 02:08:00,369
a soil garden if it's a hydro garden go

3070
02:07:59,079 --> 02:08:02,619
ahead and start turn it on the rez and

3071
02:08:00,369 --> 02:08:03,939
get it going are the pumps or whatever

3072
02:08:02,619 --> 02:08:05,409
you got to do there's so much there's so

3073
02:08:03,939 --> 02:08:08,199
many different ways to do hydro you guys

3074
02:08:05,409 --> 02:08:10,659
I am learning hydro all right I'm gonna

3075
02:08:08,199 --> 02:08:11,889
say that this lesson for pH is pretty

3076
02:08:10,659 --> 02:08:13,930
much wrapped up I feel like I've covered

3077
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:15,550
all of my bullet points keep in mind

3078
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:19,150
that your local water will change and

3079
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:20,079
you should check that out um that's the

3080
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:21,519
kind of [ __ ] that you should worry about

3081
02:08:20,079 --> 02:08:22,869
your local waters gonna change

3082
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,460
frequently and there's nothing that you

3083
02:08:22,869 --> 02:08:26,470
can do about it you're gonna have to

3084
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:28,779
just be on top of that the only way that

3085
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:31,150
you can really control your water is if

3086
02:08:28,779 --> 02:08:33,759
you set up a reverse osmosis machine and

3087
02:08:31,149 --> 02:08:35,979
you start cleaning everything out of all

3088
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,360
of your water and starting fresh but

3089
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:39,669
that could be a whole nother lesson I'll

3090
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:41,109
find I will try to find a water expert

3091
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:43,359
if you were listening and you're an

3092
02:08:41,109 --> 02:08:45,969
expert on water and water quality for a

3093
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:47,679
grow you let me know I'll bring you on

3094
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:49,720
the show and you can teach us all about

3095
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:53,079
water I know a lot about the plant but

3096
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:54,460
there are so many niche in niche areas

3097
02:08:53,079 --> 02:08:56,409
that people have perfected like our

3098
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:58,210
buddy Shawn's got organics figured out

3099
02:08:56,409 --> 02:09:00,460
and I seem to be the breeder in the

3100
02:08:58,210 --> 02:09:02,109
group and then Spence is the hatch guy

3101
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:03,369
there are just so many small branches of

3102
02:09:02,109 --> 02:09:04,750
this that we've got figured out that

3103
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:06,699
each person does their own little as

3104
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:08,890
mastered so I'm gonna try to get a water

3105
02:09:06,699 --> 02:09:11,079
guy on here for you guys I will talk

3106
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:13,060
about water quality and what you should

3107
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:15,640
be looking for it could probably be just

3108
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:17,410
a segment anyway I was gonna branch off

3109
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:20,020
and say dude I have been learning hydro

3110
02:09:17,409 --> 02:09:21,369
I've been talking to my buddy John that

3111
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:22,740
works with me at the spot he is the

3112
02:09:21,369 --> 02:09:25,590
hydro master

3113
02:09:22,739 --> 02:09:27,359
I will be learning so much hydro in a

3114
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:29,190
crash course here in the next few months

3115
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:31,380
that you guys are going to learn hydro

3116
02:09:29,189 --> 02:09:33,629
with me I will learn a bunch I will

3117
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:36,960
start sharing the hydro talk with you

3118
02:09:33,630 --> 02:09:38,970
guys we are building the most killer

3119
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:41,100
grow facility at the spot dispensary in

3120
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:43,110
Pueblo es Colorado you guys there are

3121
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,910
over a hundred lights and flower there

3122
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:48,799
are four flowering rooms broken down

3123
02:09:44,909 --> 02:09:52,380
they have 24 to 26 lights per room um

3124
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:55,350
we've got a really nice veggie area we

3125
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:59,670
are running 50 foot long flood and drain

3126
02:09:55,350 --> 02:10:01,710
tables that we fill up fill up about 150

3127
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:03,300
gallons worth of water for a res we

3128
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:05,970
makes a hundred and fifty Cal ins worth

3129
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:08,100
of newts we pump that into the table at

3130
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:09,960
one end it shoots all the way to the

3131
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:13,710
other end of the table goes into a drain

3132
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:15,840
there's a pump a really snazzy pump the

3133
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:17,789
quality they use at SeaWorld shoots all

3134
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:21,900
of that water through 50 feet of tubing

3135
02:10:17,789 --> 02:10:23,789
I think it's 2 inch or 3 inch PVC all

3136
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:25,500
the way back to the other end of the

3137
02:10:23,789 --> 02:10:27,600
table and then it dumps it back into the

3138
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:30,060
table and just keeps recirculating it

3139
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:31,680
and then under each plants and then we

3140
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,910
have I can't really tell you too much

3141
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:34,950
about how we do the plant sights because

3142
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:37,019
that's kind of a proprietary thing we've

3143
02:10:34,949 --> 02:10:40,658
got each plant is designated its own

3144
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:43,300
site and it's in a Rockville cube

3145
02:10:40,658 --> 02:10:46,269
and underneath each rockwool cube and

3146
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:48,369
plant site there is a ring shooting a

3147
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:50,889
lot of oxygen of underneath these plants

3148
02:10:48,369 --> 02:10:52,569
so it's we're feeding from the bottom

3149
02:10:50,889 --> 02:10:55,539
and the rock hole is waking it up and

3150
02:10:52,569 --> 02:10:57,099
then we may we're not sure if we want to

3151
02:10:55,539 --> 02:11:00,010
do this yet but there may be a drip line

3152
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:02,409
put in to top feed all of the plants so

3153
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:04,539
that we can drip that nutrient solution

3154
02:11:02,408 --> 02:11:05,948
into the rock pool cube from the top and

3155
02:11:04,539 --> 02:11:07,658
then just let the roots hang into that

3156
02:11:05,948 --> 02:11:09,250
oxygenated water but you guys I'm

3157
02:11:07,658 --> 02:11:11,829
learning so damn much about hydro I have

3158
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:14,649
built we have built I can't say I built

3159
02:11:11,829 --> 02:11:16,779
I have been involved in building a huge

3160
02:11:14,649 --> 02:11:18,189
hydro environment and I have learned so

3161
02:11:16,779 --> 02:11:19,869
much without even putting plants in

3162
02:11:18,189 --> 02:11:23,229
there yet well you're almost ready for

3163
02:11:19,869 --> 02:11:25,719
plants in there we will be pulling

3164
02:11:23,229 --> 02:11:27,218
harvests out of there in no time it

3165
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:28,630
feels like we are so ready I'm getting

3166
02:11:27,219 --> 02:11:29,948
stoked you guys can tell just by the

3167
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:31,659
tone of my voice that I'm [ __ ]

3168
02:11:29,948 --> 02:11:33,189

you for listening it feels like it's

3181
02:11:53,649 --> 02:11:57,189
almost time to wrap up the show since

3182
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:58,899
you've listened to this far I'm gonna do

3183
02:11:57,189 --> 02:11:59,919
this to you this podcast was of course

3184
02:11:58,899 --> 02:12:01,809
brought to you by my good friends at

3185
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,399
hydro indoor growing supplies hydro does

3186
02:12:01,810 --> 02:12:05,830
have two locations to serve Colorado

3187
02:12:03,399 --> 02:12:07,629
they have a Denver store it's on 62 71

3188
02:12:05,829 --> 02:12:10,179
beech tree and then there's my favorite

3189
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:11,560
it's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th

using the new zoom h6 handy recorder I

3345
02:19:59,939 --> 02:20:03,930
got the zoom h6 so that I will be able

3346
02:20:02,309 --> 02:20:05,788
to take this podcast on the road a

3347
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:07,889
little bit it's a much smaller unit than

3348
02:20:05,789 --> 02:20:09,930
what I've been using this thing will fit

3349
02:20:07,889 --> 02:20:12,510
in my back pocket and I can carry it

3350
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:14,309
around and I can do shows from events

3351
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:17,010
such as the secret cup the cannabis cup

3352
02:20:14,309 --> 02:20:19,498

3353
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:20,969
forward to episodes with special guests

3354
02:20:19,498 --> 02:20:22,799
coming up because now I can take the

3355
02:20:20,969 --> 02:20:23,709
show to them instead of trying to get

3356
02:20:22,799 --> 02:20:25,478
people to come to me

3357
02:20:23,709 --> 02:20:27,698
I live in kind of a shitty part of

3358
02:20:25,478 --> 02:20:30,519
Colorado where nobody wants to go so

3359
02:20:27,699 --> 02:20:32,470
it's hard to get like damsel and hunt

3360
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:33,850
and people like that to come here but if

3361
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:36,010
I go to them they're happy to be on the

3362
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:38,370
show so spend a few bucks I got the zoom

3363
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:40,420
h6 we will take this show on the road

3364
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:41,680
guys I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor

3365
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:42,609
since you're listening to the show let

3366
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:44,318
me know what you think of the sound

3367
02:20:42,609 --> 02:20:46,029
quality let me know if this quality is

3368
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:47,528
acceptable let me know if it I've

3369
02:20:46,029 --> 02:20:49,840
changed anything that you've noticed

3370
02:20:47,529 --> 02:20:52,090
because if this isn't acceptable I'll go

3371
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:53,859
back to using the main studio setup

3372
02:20:52,090 --> 02:20:55,630
I just wanted to pull this out give it a

3373
02:20:53,859 --> 02:20:57,100
try see what it was like before I try to

3374
02:20:55,629 --> 02:21:01,089
take it on the road and record with

3375
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:03,279
other people so age six well you know

3376
02:21:01,090 --> 02:21:04,210
what you think of it you guys alright so

3377
02:21:03,279 --> 02:21:07,600
let's get into the show

3378
02:21:04,209 --> 02:21:10,089
I told you that I saw some ducting

3379
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:11,020
issues I did a consultation for a friend

3380
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:12,159
of mine I didn't even charge him for

3381
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:13,750
the-- of the day but he's been saying

3382
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:15,789
dude my room is getting way too hot this

3383
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:16,689
summer what can I do and I was like you

3384
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:20,620
know what that's a good start of a

3385
02:21:16,689 --> 02:21:23,079
podcast so I walked in there and and the

3386
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:24,489
first thing I see is messy ass ducting

3387
02:21:23,079 --> 02:21:25,930
the students got a decent girl room he's

3388
02:21:24,488 --> 02:21:28,779
got enough air conditioning his plants

3389
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:30,550
look good but his ducting was a complete

3390
02:21:28,779 --> 02:21:32,738
mess you guys and I've seen a lot of

3391
02:21:30,549 --> 02:21:35,049
messy ducting lately on my visits and

3392
02:21:32,738 --> 02:21:37,420
consultations so one thing I'll tell you

3393
02:21:35,049 --> 02:21:39,879
is keep in mind that every single twist

3394
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:41,409
and Bend in your ducting Razoo reduces

3395
02:21:39,879 --> 02:21:43,358
your air flow and adds to the workload

3396
02:21:41,409 --> 02:21:46,840
of your blower whatever kind of inline

3397
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:48,760
fan you're using every Bend puts more

3398
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:50,318
strain and more pressure on that inline

3399
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:53,109
fan and slows down the amount of air

3400
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:54,728
you're moving so ideally ducting would

3401
02:21:53,109 --> 02:21:57,068
be in a straight line with zero curves

3402
02:21:54,728 --> 02:21:58,420
or bends or twists or anything like that

3403
02:21:57,068 --> 02:21:59,889
but I know that's not that's not

3404
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:01,238
rational because of course we're growing

3405
02:21:59,889 --> 02:22:03,670
in houses and things like that and you

3406
02:22:01,238 --> 02:22:05,289
have to move the air around and not a

3407
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:06,270
straight line sometimes but try to get

3408
02:22:05,290 --> 02:22:08,020
it as straight as you can

3409
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:09,729
that'll save you a lot of money on

3410
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:11,170
heating costs it'll save you money

3411
02:22:09,728 --> 02:22:12,818
because you don't have to run the blower

3412
02:22:11,170 --> 02:22:14,648
as hard it'll save you money because

3413
02:22:12,818 --> 02:22:17,260
you're more efficiently cooling so

3414
02:22:14,648 --> 02:22:18,099
straighten out oh I just noticed

3415
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:19,870
something when you put the cell phone

3416
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:21,550
too close to the h6 you get a little bit

3417
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:22,660
of interference so that's good to know

3418
02:22:21,549 --> 02:22:24,099
sorry about that guys I hope you didn't

3419
02:22:22,659 --> 02:22:25,420
hear that too much I'm reading notes off

3420
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:27,640
of my cell phone here which is why I did

3421
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:29,799
that anyway try to keep producting in a

3422
02:22:27,639 --> 02:22:31,148
straight line another great way to save

3423
02:22:29,799 --> 02:22:34,619
some money on cooling you guys would be

3424
02:22:31,148 --> 02:22:34,619
to run your lights at night

3425
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:39,950
kilowatts from The Electric Company are

3426
02:22:37,310 --> 02:22:41,539
actually cheaper at night so if you're

3427
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:44,150
not running your electricity at peak

3428
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:45,681
hours it'll save you a few bucks so what

3429
02:22:44,149 --> 02:22:46,970
I would recommend if you can do it and

3430
02:22:45,681 --> 02:22:48,980
this will only work for some people on

3431
02:22:46,970 --> 02:22:50,329
your lifestyle your schedule if you can

3432
02:22:48,979 --> 02:22:52,489
have your plants come on

3433
02:22:50,329 --> 02:22:53,989
right around here it gets dark about

3434
02:22:52,489 --> 02:22:56,091
nine o'clock eight or nine o'clock ish

3435
02:22:53,989 --> 02:22:56,989
right now it would be ideal to have your

3436
02:22:56,091 --> 02:23:00,101
lights come on

3437
02:22:56,989 --> 02:23:03,021
at 9:00 p.m. that way it's cool outside

3438
02:23:00,101 --> 02:23:05,091
the Sun has gone down the whites kick on

3439
02:23:03,021 --> 02:23:07,221
and that way you're not fighting the Sun

3440
02:23:05,091 --> 02:23:08,720
all day you're not adding Sun and grow

3441
02:23:07,220 --> 02:23:10,970
lights to that grow room to try to cool

3442
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:14,750
down so turn on your lights at night if

3443
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:15,979
you can that'll help you out all right

3444
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:17,091
so you guys straighten out your ducting

3445
02:23:15,979 --> 02:23:18,649
wring your light cycle at night and

3446
02:23:17,091 --> 02:23:20,390
you'll save a few bucks on cooling costs

3447
02:23:18,649 --> 02:23:21,800
getting your plants too hot is gonna

3448
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:23,779
cause them to become fluffy and it's

3449
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:25,010
gonna decrease your harvest weight so

3450
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:27,261
when you've got electricity bills to

3451
02:23:25,011 --> 02:23:29,540
cover every gram counts so you got to do

3452
02:23:27,261 --> 02:23:31,280
your best to pull every gram you can out

3453
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:33,410
of the room since you've got to pay for

3454
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:34,851
every kilowatt that you've used so

3455
02:23:33,409 --> 02:23:36,860
figure out how to get the ducting

3456
02:23:34,851 --> 02:23:38,659
straight start running the lights at

3457
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:39,891
night and that will help you out quite a

3458
02:23:38,659 --> 02:23:41,091
bit something else you guys could keep

3459
02:23:39,890 --> 02:23:43,909
in mind during these hot summer months

3460
02:23:41,091 --> 02:23:45,890
is humidity as the temperatures rise the

3461
02:23:43,909 --> 02:23:48,409
humidity outside is rising also so be

3462
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:50,029
aware of how humid your rooms are this

3463
02:23:48,409 --> 02:23:51,800
is the first year that I have personally

3464
02:23:50,030 --> 02:23:54,110
needed to go buy a dehumidifier from my

3465
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:55,640
main flowering room fans and air

3466
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:57,440
conditioning are not enough sometimes

3467
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:59,181
you guys you need to remove the stagnant

3468
02:23:57,440 --> 02:24:01,551
humid air from your rooms and replace it

3469
02:23:59,181 --> 02:24:03,380
with fresh co2 rich air for your plants

3470
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:05,390
so you guys make sure you're pulling

3471
02:24:03,379 --> 02:24:08,750
that air how that hot air needs to be

3472
02:24:05,390 --> 02:24:10,069
sucked out all right one more thing I

3473
02:24:08,750 --> 02:24:11,870
can think of to help you keep your rooms

3474
02:24:10,069 --> 02:24:13,879
cool is to pay attention to the filters

3475
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:16,160
and your air conditioners guys those

3476
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:18,350
filters are designed to last for a year

3477
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:20,030
without being replaced but keep in mind

3478
02:24:18,351 --> 02:24:22,641
you guys are running them in a grow room

3479
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:24,530
or there may be a lot of extra dirt a

3480
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:25,970
lot of humidity and there's a lot of

3481
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:27,561
extra work on that unit they don't

3482
02:24:25,970 --> 02:24:29,270
expect that unit to be competing with

3483
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:31,279
four or five or six whatever you got

3484
02:24:29,271 --> 02:24:32,841
that many thousand watt lights they

3485
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:34,641
don't expect that thing to come on when

3486
02:24:32,841 --> 02:24:36,560
you buy it and never shut off like a lot

3487
02:24:34,640 --> 02:24:37,670
of us do with an air conditioner so if

3488
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:39,470
you've got an air conditioner that has

3489
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:42,530
filters replace those once they get

3490
02:24:39,470 --> 02:24:43,879
clogged up if they're doesn't flow

3491
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:45,681
through you don't get as much cooling

3492
02:24:43,879 --> 02:24:46,909
you're wasting electricity that

3493
02:24:45,681 --> 02:24:48,590
electricity is not turning

3494
02:24:46,909 --> 02:24:51,079
- a gram of weed so you're flushing

3495
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:52,340
money down the toilet basically your air

3496
02:24:51,079 --> 02:24:54,049
conditioner may require a little extra

3497
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:55,760
maintenance since we're working it so

3498
02:24:54,049 --> 02:24:56,629
hard you guys and also keep in mind

3499
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:58,610
where you're putting your air

3500
02:24:56,629 --> 02:25:00,140
conditioner they may suck up a little

3501
02:24:58,610 --> 02:25:02,480
bit more dirt and [ __ ] like that just

3502
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:04,520
depending on where you have put it all

3503
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:05,600
right so that was a good little rant

3504
02:25:04,521 --> 02:25:07,159
since we're talking about replacing

3505
02:25:05,601 --> 02:25:08,420
things and things that you need to

3506
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:10,310
upgrade in your grow room I figured I'd

3507
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:11,659
make a little kind of a checklist of

3508
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:14,180
things it would be a good idea to

3509
02:25:11,659 --> 02:25:16,640
replace and check on one thing that you

3510
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:19,101
guys need to replace is your bulbs in

3511
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:21,469
your grow rooms the HID bulbs don't last

3512
02:25:19,101 --> 02:25:23,060
forever if you're using good bulbs you

3513
02:25:21,469 --> 02:25:25,069
can switch those out about once every

3514
02:25:23,060 --> 02:25:27,680
six months or if you've got the budget

3515
02:25:25,069 --> 02:25:30,409
you can toss them every two crops which

3516
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:31,940
would be about every four months that's

3517
02:25:30,409 --> 02:25:33,890
why if you're using moley as a flowering

3518
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:35,480
cycle if you're buying those cheap plant

3519
02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:36,920
max bulbs you guys or whatever generic

3520
02:25:35,479 --> 02:25:38,569
brand you you're buying at your grow

3521
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:41,000
shop I would recommend replacing those

3522
02:25:38,569 --> 02:25:42,500
every single flowering cycle those

3523
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,200
aren't high quality bulbs and they burn

3524
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:46,459
out a little bit quickly all right if

3525
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,659
you're using those cheap bulbs guys what

3526
02:25:46,459 --> 02:25:49,429
I would recommend is harvest the room

3527
02:25:47,659 --> 02:25:51,619
empty the room clean it out and replace

3528
02:25:49,430 --> 02:25:53,390
those bulbs before you put new plants in

3529
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:55,760
there again if you're using good bulbs

3530
02:25:53,390 --> 02:25:58,069
you can go probably two cycles maybe

3531
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:00,530
three I definitely wouldn't go past for

3532
02:25:58,069 --> 02:26:03,289
flowering cycles but the same bulb I

3533
02:26:00,530 --> 02:26:04,970
would replace that the bulb will stop

3534
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:06,410
putting out as much light but it will

3535
02:26:04,969 --> 02:26:09,020
still be sucking up as much electricity

3536
02:26:06,409 --> 02:26:11,030
it will still be making as much heat and

3537
02:26:09,021 --> 02:26:13,250
again you're not turning those kilowatts

3538
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:14,690
into grams of weed which is your goal

3539
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:16,729
you don't want to pay for electricity

3540
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:18,440
that is just causing heat which is

3541
02:26:16,729 --> 02:26:21,109
making your air conditioner run stronger

3542
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:23,000
which is pulling more electricity you

3543
02:26:21,110 --> 02:26:24,771
see the cycle here all right so don't

3544
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,909
forget that your bulbs in your veg area

3545
02:26:24,771 --> 02:26:27,320
are just as important isn't your

3546
02:26:25,909 --> 02:26:29,690
flowering room you guys you got to swap

3547
02:26:27,319 --> 02:26:32,060
those bulbs out occasionally also I like

3548
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:34,489
those new 315 bulbs I'll reason those at

3549
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:36,590
the shop they seem to put out quite a

3550
02:26:34,489 --> 02:26:38,149
bit of light and they're affordable so

3551
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:40,101
if you guys can afford the three 15s I

3552
02:26:38,149 --> 02:26:41,359
would definitely recommend those if you

3553
02:26:40,101 --> 02:26:43,450
want to go with your metal halide bulbs

3554
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:46,130
I would recommend those again every

3555
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:48,320
every two months every four months every

3556
02:26:46,129 --> 02:26:49,850
six months at the very longest you guys

3557
02:26:48,319 --> 02:26:51,409
I wouldn't run longer than six months on

3558
02:26:49,851 --> 02:26:53,391
the same bulb no matter what you're

3559
02:26:51,409 --> 02:26:55,129
doing with it if you've got those t5

3560
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:56,750
bulbs you're gonna need to replace those

3561
02:26:55,129 --> 02:26:59,209
quite frequently those things just crap

3562
02:26:56,750 --> 02:27:01,250
out what I've noticed about the t5 is if

3563
02:26:59,209 --> 02:27:02,659
you buy a fixture with like 85

3564
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:05,329
I was in it just pretty much planning on

3565
02:27:02,659 --> 02:27:07,159
replacing all eight t5 bulbs all at the

3566
02:27:05,329 --> 02:27:08,899
same time because they're all just gonna

3567
02:27:07,159 --> 02:27:11,840
start [ __ ] now when one goes out just go

3568
02:27:08,899 --> 02:27:13,309
buy the whole set all right you guys

3569
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:14,989
we've talked about replacing your bulbs

3570
02:27:13,309 --> 02:27:16,819
now what about the ballasts if you're

3571
02:27:14,989 --> 02:27:18,289
using modern modern digital ballot

3572
02:27:16,819 --> 02:27:20,180
digital ballasts they'll last a while

3573
02:27:18,290 --> 02:27:22,520
most of them come with a nice warranty

3574
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:24,739
so you didn't hear this from me but

3575
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:26,329
anything that comes with a warranty that

3576
02:27:24,739 --> 02:27:28,729
will be replaced because of the warranty

3577
02:27:26,329 --> 02:27:30,440
I make sure to break that thing about a

3578
02:27:28,729 --> 02:27:31,760
month or two before the warranty is up

3579
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:33,980
sometimes a few months before the

3580
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,360
warranty is up just break it just

3581
02:27:33,979 --> 02:27:36,590
[ __ ] break it and then go get another

3582
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:37,730
one on the warranty because these

3583
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:39,380
companies are charging you enough for

3584
02:27:37,729 --> 02:27:40,909
[ __ ] anyway it should last a while

3585
02:27:39,379 --> 02:27:42,259
breaking they'll get a new one they're

3586
02:27:40,909 --> 02:27:43,729
gonna refurbish the one that you've got

3587
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:45,469
they're gonna resell it as a refurbished

3588
02:27:43,729 --> 02:27:46,879
unit don't worry about them they make

3589
02:27:45,469 --> 02:27:48,170
plenty of money just break the [ __ ]

3590
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:51,259
thing right before the warranty is up

3591
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:53,059
and get yourself a new one those old

3592
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:57,170
magnetic ballasts those things will go

3593
02:27:53,059 --> 02:27:58,549
forever you won't see any drop in light

3594
02:27:57,170 --> 02:28:00,739
power from a ballast from what I've

3595
02:27:58,549 --> 02:28:03,739
noticed they'll just die one day it

3596
02:28:00,739 --> 02:28:05,209
won't even warn you so when your ballast

3597
02:28:03,739 --> 02:28:07,369
warranty is about to be a go get another

3598
02:28:05,209 --> 02:28:09,379
one you guys that should be enough

3599
02:28:07,370 --> 02:28:11,300
ranting for now about fixing your rooms

3600
02:28:09,379 --> 02:28:12,409
one thing I should remind you of that I

3601
02:28:11,299 --> 02:28:13,699
have mentioned in a previous episode

3602
02:28:12,409 --> 02:28:16,549
since we're talking about replacing

3603
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:20,990
things calibrate your pH meters you guys

3604
02:28:16,549 --> 02:28:22,609
your TDS pins your pH pins whatever else

3605
02:28:20,989 --> 02:28:24,530
you want to call it your EC meter if

3606
02:28:22,610 --> 02:28:26,300
you're in England or Britain you guys

3607
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:28,310
calibrate those things quite frequently

3608
02:28:26,299 --> 02:28:29,750
because when that messes up you don't

3609
02:28:28,309 --> 02:28:31,430
even notice and you're just in there

3610
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:32,690
trying to adjust pH and you're doing it

3611
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:35,030
wrong and you don't know so you're gonna

3612
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:36,590
start causing problems all right guys

3613
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:39,230
I've been going for just over 10 minutes

3614
02:28:36,590 --> 02:28:41,059
here I need a quick dab so uh you know

3615
02:28:39,229 --> 02:28:45,520

3616
02:28:41,059 --> 02:28:48,010
recently gifted some blueberry headband

3617
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,750
from the spa it's actually the shatter

3618
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:51,760
is from our boys at tur pecs I got it at

3619

3620

take a quick drink of this bubbly

3621
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:55,840
carbonated beverage I got here and then

3622
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:57,400
we're gonna put together a dad and we're

3623
02:28:55,840 --> 02:29:01,770

3661
02:30:16,959 --> 02:30:20,978
from torpex available at the spot

3662
02:30:18,939 --> 02:30:22,450
dispensary you know by the time you hear

3663
02:30:20,978 --> 02:30:23,920
this they'll have a totally different

3664
02:30:22,450 --> 02:30:25,300
brand of shatter and our totally

3665
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:27,898
different flavor but let's review this

3666
02:30:25,299 --> 02:30:27,898
anyway here we go

3667
02:30:29,299 --> 02:30:34,789
[Music]

3668
02:30:35,049 --> 02:30:45,049
it's definitely smooth nice and smooth

3669
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:47,329
no joke I like that so let me back up a

3670
02:30:45,049 --> 02:30:49,159
step here by looking at it it's nice and

3671
02:30:47,329 --> 02:30:51,409
glossy it's got a nice shine to it

3672
02:30:49,159 --> 02:30:53,329
ah it's nice and clear it's got a nice

3673
02:30:51,409 --> 02:30:57,139
clear amber yellow color so it looks

3674
02:30:53,329 --> 02:30:58,309
great on the inhale well let me talk

3675
02:30:57,139 --> 02:30:59,719
about the smell it just smelled like

3676
02:30:58,309 --> 02:31:02,930
hash let's smell it again let's put it

3677
02:30:59,719 --> 02:31:04,309
up to the nose just like shatter mostly

3678
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:06,439
smells the same it's got that shatter II

3679
02:31:04,309 --> 02:31:07,129
like almost a honey kind of a sweet

3680
02:31:06,439 --> 02:31:09,620
smell to it

3681
02:31:07,129 --> 02:31:11,779
but anyway it looks good that smells

3682
02:31:09,620 --> 02:31:14,329
good when I taste it on the inhale I

3683
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:17,840
definitely tasted the blueberry on the

3684
02:31:14,329 --> 02:31:20,510
exhale it had a hint of cushy chemi type

3685
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:22,819
of stuff I'm an earthy flavor on the out

3686
02:31:20,510 --> 02:31:24,370
so the N is blueberries and there's a

3687
02:31:22,819 --> 02:31:26,959
hint of blueberry on the tongue still

3688
02:31:24,370 --> 02:31:28,970
but you know what the feeling is

3689
02:31:26,959 --> 02:31:31,129
straight headband it feels like I just

3690
02:31:28,969 --> 02:31:32,478
put a headband on my head it feels like

3691
02:31:31,129 --> 02:31:34,849
I just slowed down to tell you the truth

3692
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:36,920
it was like chills I could just slow

3693
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:38,540
down a whole bunch so well let's get

3694
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:40,460
back into doing a podcast I certainly

3695
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:41,960
approve of the blueberry headband it

3696
02:31:40,459 --> 02:31:44,839
tastes like blueberry it feels like

3697
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:47,478
headband it's smooth I don't I smoked

3698
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:49,040
for me to tell you the truth guys excuse

3699
02:31:47,478 --> 02:31:50,840
the cough alright now that I buy a [ __ ]

3700
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:52,220
I want to answer some questions that

3701
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:53,989
people have sent to me these questions

3702
02:31:52,219 --> 02:31:55,639
have come from periscope they've come

3703
02:31:53,989 --> 02:31:57,409
from Twitter I've gotten them in emails

3704
02:31:55,639 --> 02:31:58,430
and I have gotten them on Facebook you

3705
02:31:57,409 --> 02:32:01,069
guys if you're not checking it out on

3706
02:31:58,430 --> 02:32:03,409
periscope every occasionally I jump on

3707
02:32:01,069 --> 02:32:04,850
to periscope and just I take a couple of

3708
02:32:03,409 --> 02:32:06,619
dabs and I rant and I hang out with my

3709
02:32:04,850 --> 02:32:08,270
friends they talked about a few things

3710
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:09,770
that are on my mind and then I just sign

3711
02:32:08,270 --> 02:32:12,620
out and say goodbye and I usually delete

3712
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:14,210
the videos pretty quickly but if you

3713
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:15,410
ever check out the periscope app make

3714
02:32:14,209 --> 02:32:16,969
sure you follow me and you can check out

3715
02:32:15,409 --> 02:32:19,670
some of the videos in the future I'll do

3716
02:32:16,969 --> 02:32:21,199
a full podcast on periscope and you'll

3717
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:22,819
be able to jump in and ask me questions

3718
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,710
and I'll be able to answer them live for

3719
02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:26,239
you the only problem with that right now

3720
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:28,099
is you guys I'm taking over as the leaf

3721
02:32:26,239 --> 02:32:29,780
grower at the spot dispensary and

3722
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:31,790
there's been a lot of work and some days

3723
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:33,439
we work until noon other days we work

3724
02:32:31,790 --> 02:32:35,240
until 6:00 it's hard to guess

3725
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:36,500
so right now scheduling things is a

3726
02:32:35,239 --> 02:32:38,049
little bit of a pain in the ass but I

3727
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:39,609
promise you I'm gonna do this periscope

3728
02:32:38,049 --> 02:32:40,929
episode I just promised you so that

3729
02:32:39,609 --> 02:32:42,250
means I've got to do it I've never

3730
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:44,800
promised you something and not done it

3731
02:32:42,250 --> 02:32:45,340
on this show all right so let me get to

3732
02:32:44,799 --> 02:32:47,349
the point here

3733
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:49,239
questions and answers with Rasta Jeff

3734
02:32:47,350 --> 02:32:52,870
our first question is about a product

3735
02:32:49,239 --> 02:32:55,629
called OGT quite a while ago I mentioned

3736
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:57,600
that I use a product called OGT veganic

3737
02:32:55,629 --> 02:32:59,438
secret sauce is what I think it's called

3738
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,068
somebody asked me to talk a little bit

3739
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:03,609
about it

3740
02:33:00,068 --> 02:33:05,049
I liked that product a whole bunch I'd

3741
02:33:03,609 --> 02:33:06,309
like it it's what it is I don't have any

3742
02:33:05,049 --> 02:33:07,509
of the product with me I've used all of

3743
02:33:06,309 --> 02:33:09,489
what I have and I kind of kind of

3744
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:12,340
haven't been using it since I ran out I

3745
02:33:09,489 --> 02:33:15,068
replaced it with something else but what

3746
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:17,409
it is is an organic tea that is able to

3747
02:33:15,068 --> 02:33:18,639
be mixed almost instantly and then fed

3748
02:33:17,409 --> 02:33:20,680
to your plants a lot of teas that we're

3749
02:33:18,639 --> 02:33:22,840
using need to be mixed up and they need

3750
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:24,579
to brew for 24 to 48 hours this stuff

3751
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:26,530
you can pour the powder into some water

3752
02:33:24,579 --> 02:33:27,609
give it a nice stir and feed it directly

3753
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:29,319
to your plants

3754
02:33:27,609 --> 02:33:31,870
one thing that I did notice that it

3755
02:33:29,318 --> 02:33:34,239
promoted ridiculously healthy roots my

3756
02:33:31,870 --> 02:33:36,040
roots were growing quickly my roots were

3757
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:37,719
growing out of the holes and the bottoms

3758
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:39,040
of my pots the drainage holes my roots

3759
02:33:37,719 --> 02:33:41,139
were coming out of there looking for

3760
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:43,780
somewhere else to go hide I have a

3761
02:33:41,139 --> 02:33:45,459
friend who breaks down the soil from my

3762
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:46,960
harvested plants he gets paid to help me

3763
02:33:45,459 --> 02:33:48,728
out a little bit and when Mike was

3764
02:33:46,959 --> 02:33:50,169
breaking down those root balls

3765
02:33:48,728 --> 02:33:51,760
he asked me dude what have you been

3766
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:54,219
doing differently lately because these

3767
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:57,130
things are amazing a lot of that I will

3768
02:33:54,219 --> 02:34:00,250
attribute to the secret sauce the

3769
02:33:57,129 --> 02:34:02,589
OGT I think it was doing a lot of it it

3770
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:05,079
was really great for the early lifecycle

3771
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:07,090
of the plants and for veg know inin when

3772
02:34:05,079 --> 02:34:08,978
I went into flour here's something that

3773
02:34:07,090 --> 02:34:10,870
I didn't realize was happening I noticed

3774
02:34:08,978 --> 02:34:13,750
there was something weird and somebody

3775
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:15,760
else pointed it out to me when I was in

3776
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:18,040
flower and I was feeding OGT I would

3777
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:19,809
feed it every other week and on those

3778
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,390
weeks I would notice that my plants

3779
02:34:19,809 --> 02:34:24,699
would progress more into what looks like

3780
02:34:22,389 --> 02:34:26,978
a nutrient deficiency on some strains I

3781
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:28,600
had strains that I I was feeding it just

3782
02:34:26,978 --> 02:34:30,129
like I have before and it looks like it

3783
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:31,809
was becoming nitrogen deficient the

3784
02:34:30,129 --> 02:34:33,849
plant couldn't keep up with itself and

3785
02:34:31,809 --> 02:34:37,059
it was just burning out really early and

3786
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:38,409
I mentioned that to our friend Sean and

3787
02:34:37,059 --> 02:34:40,329
I mentioned that the only thing I was

3788
02:34:38,409 --> 02:34:43,270
using differently was the OG tea and

3789
02:34:40,329 --> 02:34:46,340
Sean said that the rock phosphates that

3790
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:48,319
they are using to produce the OG tea

3791
02:34:46,340 --> 02:34:50,898
speed up the nutritive cycle of your

3792
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:52,969
plan so if you're going to use this

3793
02:34:50,898 --> 02:34:55,819
stuff I would only use it during the veg

3794
02:34:52,969 --> 02:34:57,590
cycle and use it very sparingly during

3795
02:34:55,819 --> 02:35:00,529
the flowering cycle because when I used

3796
02:34:57,590 --> 02:35:02,780
the recommended dosage it sped my plants

3797
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:05,659
up almost too much and they weren't

3798
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:07,939
burned but they were almost not able to

3799
02:35:05,659 --> 02:35:09,799
they were growing so quickly and using

3800
02:35:07,939 --> 02:35:11,389
nutrients so quickly if they were eating

3801
02:35:09,799 --> 02:35:12,949
all of their food for the week within

3802
02:35:11,389 --> 02:35:14,449
the first couple of the days and then

3803
02:35:12,950 --> 02:35:16,520
starving themselves is what it looked

3804
02:35:14,450 --> 02:35:18,800
like was happening so that is my little

3805
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:19,970
rant on OGT it's a good product

3806
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:21,529
but if you're going to use it be

3807
02:35:19,969 --> 02:35:22,969
prepared and you're gonna have to adjust

3808
02:35:21,530 --> 02:35:24,560
your feeding they're gonna have to pay

3809
02:35:22,969 --> 02:35:26,299
attention but I hope you're doing that

3810
02:35:24,559 --> 02:35:28,939
every time you put a new product into

3811
02:35:26,299 --> 02:35:31,819
your garden anyway alright so our next

3812
02:35:28,939 --> 02:35:34,340
question I want to move on where did I

3813
02:35:31,819 --> 02:35:35,989
put it here we go our next question

3814
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:37,159
comes from periscope and somebody asked

3815
02:35:35,989 --> 02:35:39,199
me and this is gonna take me a little

3816
02:35:37,159 --> 02:35:42,950
bit to do to describe here but somebody

3817
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:44,510
said what is solvent list because I was

3818
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:46,280
talking about solvent list on periscope

3819
02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:48,770
and they did not have it in context so

3820
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:53,210
let me try to describe to you what

3821
02:35:48,770 --> 02:35:57,670
solvent list is first off let me say

3822
02:35:53,209 --> 02:36:00,829
that solvent list is a marketing term

3823
02:35:57,670 --> 02:36:02,569
solvent Lissa's owned by McAtee of

3824
02:36:00,829 --> 02:36:04,909
essential extracts I don't know if it's

3825
02:36:02,569 --> 02:36:06,859
owned by him but it is the marketing

3826
02:36:04,909 --> 02:36:11,600
term that he has put on what he calls

3827
02:36:06,859 --> 02:36:14,899
solvent lists now that being said not

3828
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:17,450
all solvent list hash has to come from

3829
02:36:14,898 --> 02:36:19,939
nicotine anything any hash that is made

3830
02:36:17,450 --> 02:36:23,930
without solvent can well be considered

3831
02:36:19,939 --> 02:36:25,489
solvent list in most cases in 99% of the

3832
02:36:23,930 --> 02:36:26,870
cases in the cannabis industry you know

3833
02:36:25,489 --> 02:36:29,420
I've never seen anything else called non

3834
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:30,560
solvent maybe dry sift but that's

3835
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:32,989
totally different

3836
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:35,989
water hash or bubble hash is solvent

3837
02:36:32,989 --> 02:36:38,478
list it's made with ice and water it's

3838
02:36:35,989 --> 02:36:42,648
not the solvents that we are using is

3839
02:36:38,478 --> 02:36:44,029
BHO Pho there are a couple other gases

3840
02:36:42,648 --> 02:36:46,279
that people are using to extract hash

3841
02:36:44,030 --> 02:36:48,710
with lately but the propane and the

3842
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:50,149
butane are the solvents and I know a lot

3843
02:36:48,709 --> 02:36:53,089
of people are gonna say but water is a

3844
02:36:50,148 --> 02:36:55,489
solvent as well right in this case and

3845
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:57,710
I'm going to paraphrase what Nikita says

3846
02:36:55,489 --> 02:36:58,810
all of the time big shout out to DJ

3847
02:36:57,709 --> 02:37:00,040
nicotine

3848
02:36:58,810 --> 02:37:02,319
we're talking about solvent less hash

3849
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:03,640
water is not being used as a solvent

3850
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:05,529
it's being used as a mechanical

3851
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:06,790
separator we're not trying to dissolve

3852
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:08,440
the trichomes we're not trying to

3853
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:10,869
dissolve the plant matter we're just

3854
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:13,329
simply using it as a way to wash the

3855
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:15,940
trichomes off of the leaves so solvent

3856
02:37:13,329 --> 02:37:19,149
less hash is basically hash made by

3857
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:22,060
using ice or water solvent less made by

3858
02:37:19,149 --> 02:37:24,159
DJ naked tea is kept at a certain

3859
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:26,319
temperature at all times and it never

3860
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:29,050
gets warm it never gets dry and never

3861
02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:31,119
hardens up it's always got a nice greasy

3862
02:37:29,050 --> 02:37:33,189
texture to it it's always real tasty

3863
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,570
that's solvent list all right so since

3864
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:36,190
we're talking about solvent list let me

3865
02:37:34,569 --> 02:37:37,690
describe a couple of other types of hash

3866
02:37:36,190 --> 02:37:40,211
just to kind of put that in perspective

3867
02:37:37,690 --> 02:37:41,530
a little bit other types of hash that

3868
02:37:40,210 --> 02:37:44,579
are super popular right now that

3869
02:37:41,530 --> 02:37:47,681
everybody talks about are BHO which is

3870
02:37:44,579 --> 02:37:50,351
butane honey oil or butane hash or dabs

3871
02:37:47,681 --> 02:37:52,421
or shatter or wax that's pretty much the

3872
02:37:50,351 --> 02:37:55,989
most popular right now and then of

3873
02:37:52,421 --> 02:37:59,711
course there is live resin live resin is

3874
02:37:55,989 --> 02:38:01,390
basically it is BHO that is made from

3875
02:37:59,710 --> 02:38:03,970
fresh frozen plants and then it is

3876
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:05,560
blasted through an obidos machine by emo

3877
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:08,439
tech the only way that you can make live

3878
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:09,970
resin is through an emo tech machine and

3879
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:12,489
I know that sounds crazy but like I said

3880
02:38:09,970 --> 02:38:14,949
earlier nikka tea has made the marketing

3881
02:38:12,489 --> 02:38:17,860
term solvent list the poison emo tech

3882
02:38:14,950 --> 02:38:20,440
have come up with the term live resin so

3883
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:21,730
unless you're running it emo textile in

3884
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:23,381
an emo tech machine

3885
02:38:21,729 --> 02:38:25,180
you're not making live resin a lot of

3886
02:38:23,380 --> 02:38:27,760
people are gonna hate on me for that but

3887
02:38:25,181 --> 02:38:29,950
that is my theory and I'm sticking to it

3888
02:38:27,761 --> 02:38:31,421
alright time for one more question this

3889
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:33,610
question comes from Facebook and it's

3890
02:38:31,421 --> 02:38:35,860
from our friend Bobby Bobby is starting

3891
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:39,280
his first grow and he's asking if it is

3892
02:38:35,860 --> 02:38:41,801
ok to use Miracle Grow plant food or

3893
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:43,989
Miracle Grow soil for his cannabis plant

3894
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:47,079
and you guys I definitely have to say I

3895
02:38:43,989 --> 02:38:50,470
strongly recommend not using any miracle

3896
02:38:47,079 --> 02:38:54,190
girl products in your garden the Miracle

3897
02:38:50,470 --> 02:38:56,710
Grow soil has time-released fertilizers

3898
02:38:54,190 --> 02:38:59,021
in it which will last for up to six

3899
02:38:56,710 --> 02:39:01,001
months and you don't want nitrogen being

3900
02:38:59,021 --> 02:39:03,190
released into your plants for six months

3901
02:39:01,001 --> 02:39:06,069
so I would recommend not using that soil

3902
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:08,471
use something like a fox farms product

3903
02:39:06,069 --> 02:39:09,671
or a roots organics product do something

3904
02:39:08,470 --> 02:39:11,109
like that if you're a new grower it

3905
02:39:09,671 --> 02:39:12,790
gives you a solid start

3906
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:14,170
there's not nutrients in it that are

3907
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:15,521
gonna screw you up

3908
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:17,920
it'll have things in it that will help

3909
02:39:15,521 --> 02:39:20,530
you out from the very beginning as for

3910
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:21,790
the the nutrients if you are trying to

3911
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:23,650
use Miracle Grow nutrients that would

3912
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:25,271
throw those away right away get rid of

3913
02:39:23,649 --> 02:39:27,699
the plant food heavier hydro shop head

3914
02:39:25,271 --> 02:39:29,620
to hydro indoor growing supplies and get

3915
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:31,480
yourself a basic two or three part

3916
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:33,700
nutrient solution there'll be a bottle a

3917
02:39:31,479 --> 02:39:35,889
a bottle beef of a brand that sounds

3918
02:39:33,700 --> 02:39:37,210
good to you the guys at the hydro shop

3919
02:39:35,889 --> 02:39:39,849
can definitely talk you through what you

3920
02:39:37,209 --> 02:39:41,289
need to help you pick a brand they're

3921
02:39:39,850 --> 02:39:43,239
mainly if you're just starting out

3922
02:39:41,290 --> 02:39:44,740
they're mainly the same thing I would

3923
02:39:43,239 --> 02:39:47,619
say go with something like the tannic

3924
02:39:44,739 --> 02:39:50,350
hair bio biz something simple just

3925
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:52,900
something with an A and a B the general

3926
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:54,790
organics or general hydroponics Florida

3927
02:39:52,899 --> 02:39:55,840
Nova stuff that's all fine any of that

3928
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:56,920
stuff you want to go for it's pretty

3929
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:58,899
much all the same thing if you're

3930
02:39:56,920 --> 02:40:01,239
starting out get yourself an A and a B

3931
02:39:58,899 --> 02:40:02,949
maybe a bloom booster and then maybe

3932
02:40:01,239 --> 02:40:05,079
like some sugary or something to sweeten

3933
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:06,880
it up but definitely get away from that

3934
02:40:05,079 --> 02:40:09,129
Miracle Grow stuff go to the hydro shop

3935
02:40:06,879 --> 02:40:11,459
get something designed more toward

3936
02:40:09,129 --> 02:40:14,109
cannabis something that you can control

3937
02:40:11,459 --> 02:40:15,759
for each cycle of your plants cuz you're

3938
02:40:14,110 --> 02:40:17,800
not gonna want the same nutrients from

3939
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:19,389
beginning to end you want a little bit

3940
02:40:17,799 --> 02:40:21,189
of grow in the beginning and you're

3941
02:40:19,389 --> 02:40:22,659
gonna taper the grow off as you get into

3942
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:25,149
flower and you'll start using the bloom

3943
02:40:22,659 --> 02:40:27,340
solution so go get something that's more

3944
02:40:25,149 --> 02:40:29,649
designed for the plants that you are

3945
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:31,149
growing Bobbie I hope that helps you out

3946
02:40:29,649 --> 02:40:32,829
you guys that are thinking about Miracle

3947
02:40:31,149 --> 02:40:34,090
Grow soil I hope I got you away from

3948
02:40:32,829 --> 02:40:37,180
that also here's something to think

3949
02:40:34,090 --> 02:40:40,450
about you guys Miracle Grow products are

3950
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:42,819
all from Scots and Scots is a Monsanto

3951
02:40:40,450 --> 02:40:44,950
brand and we do not want to support

3952
02:40:42,819 --> 02:40:47,110
Monsanto because Monsanto does not

3953
02:40:44,950 --> 02:40:48,370
support the world so that's something to

3954
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:50,230
think about think about where the

3955
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:52,210
products you are buying are made and who

3956
02:40:50,229 --> 02:40:53,850
they affect and the impact that you will

3957
02:40:52,209 --> 02:40:55,719
have on the world

3958
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:56,950
all right you guys I think that was

3959
02:40:55,719 --> 02:40:58,329
enough questions for one episode I

3960
02:40:56,950 --> 02:41:00,010
