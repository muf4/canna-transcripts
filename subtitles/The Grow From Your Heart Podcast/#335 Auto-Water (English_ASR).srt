yo what's up podcast world it's Rasta

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,819
Jeff before we get the show started let

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,889
me make a quick disclaimer and sort of

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,960
an apology I feel like I recorded a

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,730
solid podcast episode I put my heart and

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,320
soul into this I wrote a lot of notes

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,690
it's been a lot of time recording this

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,250
show as I was listening back to edit

9
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,960
parts of the audio files started

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,789
disappearing I don't know what was

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
happening to my computer or my software

12
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,118
but the words I was saying we're

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,429
disappearing from the [ __ ] screen as

14
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,050
time went on the more I tried to play

15
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,309
with the computer and edit and figure

16
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,349
out what happened the more [ __ ] was

17
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,009
disappearing so it was making my podcast

18
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,039
vanish

19
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,659

00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,519
got a lot to talk about in this episode

77
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,379
so I'm going to try and make this intro

78
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,939
quick I like to start the show off by

79
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,490
letting you know what I'm smoking on

80
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,500
today I've been taking dabs of the cam

81
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,659
Brule full-spectrum extract from our

82
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,870
friends at Green Dot labs this is the

83
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:50,060
copper chem cross two lemon brulee it is

84
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,620
described as rotten lemon rind and sour

85
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,319
fuel and I think that is a perfect

86
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,209
description it tastes delicious the dabs

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,560
are nice and smooth the high goes

88
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,180
straight to the eyes it's a straight

89
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,420
head high I love what it did to my head

90
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,980
the dad was super smooth it tastes

91
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,899
really good and the consistency the

92
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:07,519
appearance and the texture are perfect

93
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,159
so big shout out to our friends at green

94
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,439
dot labs for the chem Brule full

95
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,030
spectrum extract it is Rasta Jeff

96
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,949
approved all right you guys we've got a

97
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,349
lot of stuff to talk about I am going to

98
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,780
run you guys through building a drip

99
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:23,479
system or an automated or assisted

100
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,400
watering system for your grow I'm going

101
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,919
to do two different versions I'm gonna

102
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,319
do a setup using kind of like a water

103
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,179
wand to set up to where you have a wand

104
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,189
and you water each plant with this wand

105
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,379
but it will be set up to a reservoir so

106
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:39,379
you're being fed then we're also going

107
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,560
to run through a set up using emitters

108
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,060
or sprinklers in each plant both of

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,890
these setups could be useful to you it's

110
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,769
up to you to decide which set up you

111
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:51,018
like in veg I usually use the water wand

112
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,170
in flower that's when I switch to the

113
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,580
auto or assisted watering system a lot

114
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,289
of what I'm saying will need to be

115
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,730
customized for your grow this will need

116
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,109
to be custom tailored for your setup

117
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:02,359
everything will need to be custom

118
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,340
measured for your grow this is going to

119
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,350
be a very good guideline on how to get

120
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,420
you started building a drip system all

121
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,689
right this will be useful for any size

122
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:13,699
grow anywhere from one light to 500

123
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:16,100
lights these ideas will work for you

124
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,149
they just may need to be modified again

125
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,410
I'm gonna talk about two different

126
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,298
setups I'm gonna talk about a drip

127
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,840
system with the emitters for each plant

128
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:25,239
and we're gonna talk about a water wand

129
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,219
a reservoir on a pump style setup once I

130
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,230
get into it it will be more clear which

131
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,820
setup is best for you they've both got

132
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,280
their benefits they've both got their

133
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,529
downfalls let's talk about benefits of

134
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,739
using a drip watering or assisted

135
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:41,769
watering system one of the first obvious

136
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,750
advantages or benefits to using a drip

137
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:46,329
or auto watering or assisted watering

138
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,889
system is that it simply makes watering

139
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,349
more efficient and it takes less time

140
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,199
which will free up a grower to do things

141
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,510
like work the canopy or defoliate or

142
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,100
scout for bugs or simply clean up things

143
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,689
that have been getting overlooked so

144
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,520
building an auto watering system will

145
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:03,040
free up time no matter how big your grow

146
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,019
is this should save you some time so

147
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,569
that is the first benefit in a large

148
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,250
facility this will free you up a lot of

149
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:11,349
time if you've got a thousand plants

150
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,029
you'll go from spending all day watering

151
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,430
plants to just a couple of hours

152
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:18,009
watering every single plant you'll have

153
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,600
to mix up solution it's probably two

154
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,430
hundred and fifty two maybe a thousand

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,350
gallons of water in some facilities you

156
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,300
have to mix it you have to adjust the pH

157
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,710
you got to make sure your PPM's are good

158
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,449
you got to write down everything you put

159
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:30,370
in there make sure your filter is clean

160
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,930
and then he hit go on the pump and you

161
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,280
turn the valve for the right room and

162
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,569
make sure that water pumps into the

163
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,279
right room and then while it's pumping

164
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,019
you run up and down the rows and make

165
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,638
sure that each emitter is spraying out

166
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:41,620
some water and as long as every plants

167
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,060
getting water you're good you let it

168
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,490
spray until all that water is empty

169
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,050
while those plants are getting fed you

170
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,939
walk through and you make sure all the

171
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,949
emitters are working but also be looking

172
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,389
for pests be looking for powdery mildew

173
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,199
be looking for something that just

174
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,848
doesn't look right

175
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,620
find the problem in the room there's

176
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:58,959
always something that can be fixed or

177
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,970
corrected be in the room looking for

178
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,098
that while the sprinklers are running

179
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,110
also catch a little bit of the water

180
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,728
catch some of the runoff that comes out

181
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,470
of the plants the stuff that comes out

182
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:11,680
of the bottom of the pots gather that

183
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,419
measure the pH measure the EC of that

184
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,340
and start writing that down and in the

185
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:17,348
future we've talked about this we can

186
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,609
diagnose problems by what you have

187
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:20,199
written down we talked about in the

188
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,520
journaling episode so while the

189
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,228
sprinklers are running that's why you

190
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,490
need to be doing checking on the plants

191
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:26,199
and catching a little bit of water

192
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,300
now we've freed up a lot of time to work

193
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,250
the canopy check for bugs do some

194
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,199
defoliating you don't have to spend all

195
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,699
day watering and while the plants are

196
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,500
getting watered we're actually in there

197
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,639
looking for bugs and making sure the

198
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,079
emitters are working

199
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,030
so we freed up a lot of time and we're

200
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,459
still getting plenty of work done while

201
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:44,318
we're watering another advantage to

202
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,938
having an automated or assisted watering

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,949
system is this will make sure that all

204
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,300
of your plants get evenly watered you

205
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,710
won't have one plant that got two

206
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,908
pitchers of water dumped on it cuz

207
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,560
somebody got a text message in the

208
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,569
middle of watering and the rest of the

209
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,158
plants only got one pitcher of water you

210
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,139
won't get a row of plants that got

211
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:00,218
skipped because you were doing a job and

212
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,689
then you saw something that had to be

213
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:03,038
fixed and you went corrected that and

214
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,689
then came back and moved on to the next

215
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,938
row and totally forgot to water a row

216
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:09,159
things like that won't happen the plants

217
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:11,319
will get evenly watered this will also

218
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,788
help reduce waste and water and

219
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,158
nutrients when you're running a large

220
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:17,139
facility you're using a lot of water and

221
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:19,449
a lot of nutrients this will help reduce

222
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,579
waste and this will also help you save

223
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:24,250
on nutrients you won't have a an

224
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,168
employee spraying like I said earlier

225
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,418
two gallons into this plant three

226
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:30,038
gallons into this pot four gallons into

227
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:32,079
this one when they all honestly only

228
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,818
needed to they'll be consistent and you

229
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,758
won't have guys wasting water which is

230
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,289
wasting nutrients all right another

231
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,150
thing that will help not only are they

232
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:42,728
going to get the same amount of water

233
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:44,348
but they will get evenly watered you

234
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,060
won't have a guy just watering one spot

235
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,709
of the plant what I've seen a lot is

236
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,149
when you have a crew watering plants

237
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:51,128
with watering wands and it takes them

238
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,658
all day to water the whole room they

239
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,099
start working and then eventually they

240
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:55,658
just set the tip of the wand right on

241
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,158
the plant right on the soil they just

242
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,860
hit go they know how long they gotta

243
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,538
count it's about 30 45 seconds you count

244
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,069
and then the plant will be sufficiently

245
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:05,079
watered then you move on to the next one

246
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,939
the type of [ __ ] won't happen if you use

247
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,348
emitters the guy won't set his water

248
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,778
wand right there and water that one

249
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:12,399
circle real heavy the emitter will spray

250
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:14,288
the entire surface you'll get water

251
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,509
throughout that whole pot the roots will

252
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:18,579
grow through the whole entire space of

253
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,199
the container and all of the media not

254
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,938
just down low where all the water got

255
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,978
saturated so that's a big advantage

256
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,509
they'll get evenly watered they'll get

257
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,609
watered all the way through where they

258
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,759
need to be they'll get saturated and it

259
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,349
will reduce your amount of waste another

260
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,389
advantage to using one of these systems

261
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,610
is that the emitters and the water wand

262
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,769
actually do add a little bit of oxygen

263
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,990
to the water all of those bubbles are a

264
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,149
good thing the more oxygen in your water

265
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,068
the better the more oxygen in your root

266
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,620
zone the better the roots will of the

267
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:49,269
oxygen so the emitters they put out that

268
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,560
little mist those are little bubbles

269
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,419
there's a lot of air in there

270
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,829
a lot of air making it a lot of space

271
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,299
between the bubbles means there's a lot

272
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,490
of air making it down into the root zone

273
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,109
even the watering wands they make a

274
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,669
couple of nice little shower patterns

275
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,740
those get a lot of air down into the

276
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:05,289
root zone that is very helpful the

277
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,149
plants do enjoy that you can also add an

278
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,909
air pump if you want to add some sort of

279
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,259
air stones to your reservoir or to your

280
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,649
trash can we'll talk about that in a

281
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,870
minute

282
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,579
you can add oxygen to it the plants will

283
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,919
thank you for it you can never go wrong

284
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,920
adding more oxygen to the water in my

285
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,370
opinion all right those are the basic

286
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,990
advantages to using an automated system

287
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,240
using an automated system or a drip

288
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,460
system or an assisted watering system is

289
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,139
not an excuse for laziness like I said

290
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,600
earlier there's plenty to inspect and

291
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,000
look at and check on while the watering

292
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,339
system is happening you can also inspect

293
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,750
the watering system itself you need to

294
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,010
make sure there are no leaks make sure

295
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,049
the filter is clean make sure the

296
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:46,059
emitters are spraying where is the water

297
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,829
draining to do you have a drain set up

298
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:49,689
is that clogged are you getting water

299
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,790
all over the floor there are so many

300
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,190
other tasks available that you just made

301
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:57,159
time to get done by creating this drip

302
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,320
system now sometimes people have an

303
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,240
automated system or a drip system setup

304
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,800
to water the plants for when they go on

305
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,149
vacation or if they've got to leave for

306
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,338
an extended amount of time or if they've

307
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,559
got an emergency or something so like

308
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,660
imagine being sick and you're not able

309
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,069
to water your plants like one time I had

310
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,779
the flu real bad and I couldn't even

311
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,820
stand up every time I stood up I would

312
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,350
puke it was a real challenge watering

313
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,020
the garden that day for a couple of days

314
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,279
if I had an auto watering system I could

315
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,029
have just filled up my reservoir and

316
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,259
then hit the button

317
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,459
and those plants would've got watered

318
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,110
and I could have went back to bed and

319
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,269
not felt like [ __ ] for those hours it

320
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,560
took me to water my plants that's just

321
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,299
kind of a random use I'm just trying to

322
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,069
throw out examples of why they're useful

323
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,719
imagine if you wanted to go away you

324
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,190
wanted to go to Vegas for a few days and

325
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,690
have a little bit of fun you want to go

326
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,070
on Phish tour for a week and have a

327
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,720
little bit of fun but you got a crop at

328
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,129
home that might die you don't trust

329
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
anybody around to water it you don't

330
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,399
need anybody coming in and out of your

331
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
house maybe nobody else knows about your

332
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,360
grow you can set up a small watering

333
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
system it will take care of those plants

334
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,490
for you while you're gone also Auto

335
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,550
watering systems could be helpful for

336
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,529
people with physical limitations imagine

337
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,659
if you're unable to lift a lot of water

338
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,159
you can't carry the water maybe your

339
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,120
mobility is limited maybe you're in a

340
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,000
wheelchair and you can't

341
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,950
between each plan maybe you've got

342
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,089
limited mobility in some sort of way I

343
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,160
don't know what's going on but this

344
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,570
could be a way that you can grow some

345
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,549
cannabis you can have somebody come help

346
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,770
you once a week maybe set up your girl

347
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,240
for you get your drip system set up get

348
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,919
your reservoir set up and then all you

349
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,000
have to do is go in there and press the

350
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,069
button and you can water those plants

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,870
every day and that way you can tend to

352
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,460
your garden you can minimize the

353
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,870
physical work that has to be done and

354
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,460
you can still grow a little bit of

355
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,799
cannabis for yourself if you're

356
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,490
physically limited so this would be

357
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,049
useful for that sort of a situation also

358
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,820
these setups are customizable and

359
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,319
expandable everything I'm going to teach

360
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,420
you is just from my limited experience

361
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,820
building drip systems and commercial

362
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,829
grows and in-home grows don't think that

363
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,990
these are rules you can expand on this

364
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,509
any way you'd like you can customize

365
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,639
this any way you'd like I may be totally

366
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,230
wrong for your setup maybe I've sparked

367
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,639
some ideas maybe I've started an

368
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,470
argument I'm just trying to show you

369
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,569
what I'm doing and get you started and

370
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,790
then you can build it perfectly for your

371
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,300
grow it's honestly easier than you might

372
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,699
think

373
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,039
to build an auto watering or an assisted

374
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,839
watering system the first step to

375
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,838
building anything or upgrading anything

376
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,240
in your grow is to have a plan do you

377
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,089
have a solid plan can you put this plan

378
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,129
on paper if so write it down draw the

379
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,720
plan let's see what you're thinking so

380
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:24,730
that you can share it and we can work on

381
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,730
it together and we both know the goal so

382
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,370
have a plan have a goal and also have a

383
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,959
reason why are you doing this so what's

384
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,450
your what's your purpose why are you

385
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,588
trying to build a watering system now

386
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,240
you know why okay

387
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,620
what's your goal are you trying to make

388
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,959
it easier you're trying to be able to go

389
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,100
on vacation there we go now you know why

390
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,859
you're doing it and what your goal is

391
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,600
know let's build a plan on how to do it

392
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,550
let's think about how many plants you

393
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,290
want to water are you watering one light

394
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,909
do you have nine you have twelve you

395
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:53,439
have sixteen plants are you trying to

396
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,689
water a whole bunch of stuff do you have

397
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,180
a four by eight table with maybe 12 or

398
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,010
24 plants in there you have a whole row

399
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,539
of [ __ ] with a hundred and 25 plants

400
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:03,450
let's think about how many sites were

401
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:05,919
gonna need how many emitters do we need

402
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,420
let's also think about are we going to

403
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,189
use emitters or do we want to use a

404
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,539
water wand if you've got a small system

405
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,760
and you liked being interactive with the

406
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,559
plants a water wand is not a bad idea

407
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,299
it's always nice and personal if you're

408
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,519
going from hand watering to a water wand

409
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,838
you're still gonna save

410
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,278
and you're still gonna get that

411
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,360
interactive feeling with your plants

412
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,519
they're gonna be in there touching each

413
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,899
plant watering each plant we get near

414
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,278
each plant with the water wand you'll

415
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,409
have to move the leaves off the bottom

416
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,028
surface you can get to the soil then

417
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,259
you'll have to water you'll still get to

418
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,580
play with the plants if you use the wand

419
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,899
if you've got a small system that's a

420
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,550
great way to go if you've got a bigger

421
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,799
system I would definitely recommend

422
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,929
using the emitters so once you've made

423
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,208
your decision on the water wand or the

424
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:44,939
emitters then it's time to draw and

425
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:47,579
design and actually build your watering

426
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,700
system I'm gonna start with building a

427
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,040
watering wand and a can watering setup

428
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,200
this is real simple this is what I would

429
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,629
recommend for a small to medium-sized

430
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,870
home grow or a small commercial grow or

431
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,820
maybe a small or large veg room for a

432
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,000
commercial grow but this is how I would

433
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,980
do it for my reservoir I use a brute

434
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,019
trashcan from the hardware store it's a

435
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,990
brand new cleaned out trash can I think

436
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,879
it's a 25 or 32 gallon I think it's a 32

437
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,470
gallon it looks like a Rubbermaid trash

438
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,250
can it says brute right on the side of

439
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,620
it I measured out to where 10 15 20 and

440
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,299
25 gallons go so I know exactly how far

441
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,459
I'm filling it at the hardware store

442
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,139
right next to these big trash cans they

443
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,509
sell the little wheels that attach to

444
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,309
the bottom get those wheels now you can

445
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,480
fill your can up and you can roll it to

446
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,799
wherever you need it you can get it

447
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,539
closer to the plants or you can get it

448
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,099
over to the nutrients it's just much

449
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:41,039
easier to handle when you've got that

450
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,589
thing on wheels I found that sometimes

451
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,049
it can be hard to fill this big-ass

452
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:49,680
trash can because your bathtub

453
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,149
the [ __ ] what is it the bathtub water

454
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,439
comes out real low I don't know the word

455
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,139
for that thing or the bathtub water

456
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,910
comes out the past of water the [ __ ]

457
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,199
faucet there we go that thing is real

458
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:00,240
low right it's down there by the bathtub

459
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,040
so it could fill the bathtub then up top

460
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
the shower heads up real high and you

461
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,009
can only adjust the angle so much unless

462
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,930
you've got the kind that comes off and

463
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,879
you got the the master baiter showerhead

464
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,859
but otherwise you're gonna have a hard

465
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,860
time getting the water into this

466
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,528
reservoir at the hardware store I found

467
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,329
a thing that is used for washing your

468
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:22,860
dog it's a the dog washer screws in

469
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:24,689
where the shower head goes and then it

470
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,129
adds an extra port with a hose coming

471
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,720
off so you take off the shower head you

472
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,070
screw in the dog washer then you screw

473
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,269
the shower head right back on it only

474
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,770
adds about an inch worth

475
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,689
get on to it I don't even notice that

476
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,120
but then it's got a pork coming off the

477
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,640
side that's where this dog washer hose

478
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,230
comes off of this other dog washer hose

479
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,809
has a shower head on it with an on and

480
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,759
off switch so you basically turn on the

481
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,609
shower and then the water starts coming

482
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,129
out of this dog washer basically the dog

483
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,050
washer is just a shower head on on us on

484
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,250
a [ __ ] hose so that you can move it

485
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,990
you can drop that right into your

486
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,909
reservoir and you can fill it up it

487
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,570
makes it so much easier for me because

488
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,579
my shower

489
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,750
it wouldn't spray into the reservoir

490
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,150
without hitting the floor and the

491
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,559
bathtub want is way too low right now I

492
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,179
feel like I'm trying to describe

493
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,500
something crazy and I probably sound

494
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,359
like it but once you get to this point

495
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,190
you're gonna go oh that's what he meant

496
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
this one's eight feet off the ground and

497
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,850
this one's two feet off the ground and

498
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,370
my trashcan is about four feet tall so I

499
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,379
get it also I should mention this thing

500
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,779
didn't mess with my shower at all once

501
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,429
you pop off the hose for the dog washer

502
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,500
and your showers becomes a normal shower

503
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:28,019
it won't disrupt your shower setup at

504
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,820
all I do recommend that you remove the

505
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,500
dog washer attachment a little the whole

506
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,180
hose part just take it off up there at

507
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,070
the the port because if you leave it

508
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,719
hanging for too long that tension that

509
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,460
it creates just from gravity just swing

510
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,200
in there for so long after a while it

511
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,240
will develop a leak right there where it

512
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,710
connects so that's my advice you guys

513
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,450
it's gonna be so much easier to fill

514
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,860
your reservoir I also use this thing to

515
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,629
clean things because my showerhead and

516
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,399
that shower doesn't come off it's it's

517
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,960
attached to the wall it's affixed so I

518
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,309
needed one that I could pull off and I

519
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,660
just clean stuff with it I kind of use

520
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,949
it like a little dishwasher and I just

521
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:57,449
wash a bunch of [ __ ] I put a thing in

522
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,750
the bottom of that shower so nothing

523
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,750
goes down

524
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,670
I guess that's a random sidenote you

525
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,230
guys be versatile be a [ __ ] MacGyver

526
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,880
in your grow room you don't always have

527
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,870
to buy something that says grow room on

528
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,640
it you don't always have to buy

529
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,929
something from one of the grow companies

530
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,150
it doesn't always have to come from

531
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,360
Hydrofarm or Sun systems or something

532
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,220
like that you can reappropriation tight

533
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,500
um's I just used a dog washer to clean

534
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,600
my pots and fill my reservoir and guess

535
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,549
what I also did I cleaned the dog with

536
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,839
it all right I better stay focused

537
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:29,480
because I've got a lot of notes and I'm

538
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,879
only through the first page here let's

539
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,220
keep going the dog washer the next part

540
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,990
if you're using ro you'll need to get

541
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,910
the water into the reservoir that you

542
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,230
can drop your Maundy pump into we're

543
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,769
gonna talk about a Maundy pump here in

544
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,259
just a minute

545
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:44,930
but if you're using RO water for either

546
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:47,089
system the water wand or the emitter

547
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,610
system you're going to need a way to get

548
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:51,199
that water into your reservoir that

549
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,879
we're able to get a pump into that we

550
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
can mix the nutrients into and then feed

551
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,300
the plants from there so you may already

552
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,519
have it pumping into a large reservoir

553
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:59,809
I'm not sure what you've got setup I

554
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,160
have no idea what your girl looks like

555
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,019
now but you're gonna need to collect

556
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,880
that RO water if you choose to use RO

557
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,519
water you're gonna need to get that into

558
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,890
this big reservoir that will then feed

559
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,869
to the plants so think about that while

560
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,400
you're designing your set up getting the

561
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,369
source water to the reservoir is

562
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,410
something that is often overlooked by

563
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,149
grow room designers by contractors

564
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,740
everyone's like so then we run the water

565
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,150
from the res to the plants and then you

566
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,130
go where does that water come from they

567
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,870
go oh [ __ ] we never piped water into

568
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,580
here so I'm just trying to remind you

569
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:31,639
now think about how you're going to get

570
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:33,919
either your municipal water or your RO

571
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,690
water into your reservoir so that we can

572
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,970
mix it up and then finally get it to

573
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,430
these plants alright so we've got the

574
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,779
water to our trash can which is we're

575
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,279
gonna be calling that a reservoir now

576
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:45,500
that is now a reservoir maybe you're

577
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,819
using a fancy expensive reservoir that's

578
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
up to you whatever you want to budget

579
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,480
for whatever you can fit through the

580
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,309
door some of those reservoirs don't fit

581
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,930
through the door make sure it fits

582
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,429
through your doorway make sure you can

583
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,310
get it into your gross space so get your

584
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,620
res get it filled with water know how

585
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:02,389
much water is in there now this is how I

586
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,909
get the water to the plants I get a

587
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,620
small sump pump the growth stores carry

588
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,940
the pump called the Monte that I keep

589
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:10,219
talking about it's a Mon D half

590
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,620
horsepower sump pump those pumps are

591
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,819
great because they come with a 3/4 inch

592
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,159
garden hose

593
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,659
Gromit attached to it all you have to do

594
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,090
is screw on a garden hose and you're

595
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,470
ready to rock so I like those Maundy

596
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:23,599
pumps you've got a trash can on wheels

597
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,970
but the Maundy pump in it I attach a

598
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,039
standard garden hose based on the length

599
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,140
that you need to reach your plants I

600
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,670
remember the cans on wheels so we can

601
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,460
move it but also the pump needs to be

602
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,769
plugged in you may need an extension

603
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,120
cord you may need a longer hose this is

604
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:40,369
where you've got to do thinking on your

605
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,839
own are you gonna roll that can down the

606
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:43,549
aisle with you or are you gonna have a

607
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,470
whole bunch of hose to coil up and drag

608
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,940
that hose all over the place where is

609
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,200
your electricity for the pump coming

610
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,210
from those are things to keep in mind

611
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,250
right now so you got a rolling can

612
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,710
that's marked for volume so you know how

613
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,900
much water is in it you've got a Maundy

614
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,549
pump it's the half horsepower Maundy

615
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,080
pump they're yellow they're really

616
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,470
common at the gross part if you search

617
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,569
Maundy sump pump half horsepower you'll

618
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,920
find it pops up on Amazon it's all over

619
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,569
the internet it's at every gross store

620
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,640
these are easy to find so you got your

621
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:11,689
rolling can mark for volume you got your

622
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,280
pump in there you've got your regular

623
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,350
garden hose coming off of there

624
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,149
now you need some way to control the

625
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,889
flow and direct the water because once

626
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,480
you plug in that pump the water is just

627
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,009
gonna shoot out of the hose there's

628
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,809
gonna be no control of it you can't turn

629
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,700
it off you can't stop it you can crimp

630
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,769
the hose but other than that it's just

631
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,620
gonna keep flowing so we need some way

632
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:33,230
to control this water this part is where

633
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:34,669
we get the water wand it's basically the

634
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,720
thing at the end of the hose remember

635
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,519
when your old man would be out there

636
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,110
water in the lawn at the beer in one

637
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,920
hand cigarette and the other and that

638
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,779
sprayer

639
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,700
just water in the lawn just spraying the

640
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,289
one was wet he's just not there sporanox

641
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,789
he didn't want to be around everybody

642
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,409
he just got their water remember that

643
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:51,259
thing that he had to water the lawn with

644
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,509
it's basically that thing but longer

645
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:55,789
it's got a longer nozzle on it that you

646
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:57,259
used to aim the water and control it to

647
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,909
get into the pot so that you're not just

648
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:00,559
spraying randomly it directs it into the

649
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,690
pots it's got an adjustable head or an

650
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,789
adjustable shower head on it you could

651
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,769
put it on a fan you can put it on shower

652
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,119
there's mist there's always flood

653
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,619
there's just a bunch of different

654
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,719
settings on it I usually like the shower

655
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:13,819
version if you want it to go faster

656
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,259
take off that unscrew the cover that

657
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,089
changes the settings and it'll just come

658
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,829
out real hard and we call that the dump

659
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,689
truck just let it just flow just cut

660
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:22,369
down the flow it's still useful because

661
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,049
use that water want as an off-and-on

662
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,879
switch and it reaches into the plants

663
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,779
it's got a nice extended arm so that's

664
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,350
what that's for

665
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:32,329
so use that thing the water wand

666
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,949
basically you can get them on Amazon you

667
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:36,349
can get them at the gross store you can

668
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,000
get them at the hardware store excuse me

669
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,439
for the throat clearing you can get

670
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,409
these water wands in a lot of different

671
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,240
styles one thing I think is you really

672
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,250
get what you pay for when it comes to a

673
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,589
water wand if you get a cheapo it's

674
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,538
gonna fall apart the off and on trigger

675
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:52,849
is gonna break on you really quickly if

676
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,140
you get a good expensive one you'll feel

677
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:55,759
the difference in the quality in the

678
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,559
trigger and the off and on switch and

679
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,700
the overall construction you'll just be

680
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,470
able to tell it's better made and it

681
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,210
will last you longer keep in mind that

682
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,710
some of them are adjustable a lot of

683
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,720
times where they're adjustable they like

684
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,490
to become lis Keable some of them are

685
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,079
too short some of them are too long I

686
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,579
like the kind that you can pivot the

687
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,569
head or not pivot but at least change

688
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,569
the angle of the head

689
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:21,470
some of them are kind of hard to squeeze

690
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,210
now that I think about it so if you

691
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,069
don't have a good squeeze power if

692
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,480
you're not uh if you're not in a

693
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,740
squeezing a hard trigger you might want

694
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,019
to find one that takes a little less

695
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,880
squeeze power I kind of like the one

696
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,470
that's got the lever you pull it up and

697
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,510
then it's on and then you'd push it down

698
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,400
and it goes off you adjust the flow by

699
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:39,529
using that lever how high up and down

700
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,910
you go it's not just a trigger I turn it

701
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:43,369
on to about three-quarters of the way

702
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,590
and I can get excuse me I can get from

703
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,029
this pot to this pot quickly enough for

704
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:48,470
I don't even have to turn it off for I

705
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,420
don't feel like I spilled enough water

706
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,220
on the floor anywhere to actually be a

707
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,900
problem so I've got it set to about

708
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,970
three quarters and I'm just water this

709
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,200
plant give it as long as it needs and

710
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,430
there just jump right over to this one

711
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,170
without even turning it off but then

712
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,490
when I'm ready to go when I'm done and I

713
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,990
want to carry the wand back to the hose

714
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,910
I just hit that off switch all the way

715
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,680
and I'm not spraying water on the floor

716
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,269
or if I've got to do some work on a

717
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,470
plant if I decide to defoliate that

718
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,240
plant while I'm looking at it or

719
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,779
reposition I can just turn it off real

720
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,309
easily

721
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,569
the water ones are really handy you guys

722
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,879
that's my point there are a lot of

723
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,500
different varieties available go to the

724
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,750
gross store go to the hardware store

725
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,269
look at the one you like or order the

726
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:26,750
one that looks the best to you on Amazon

727
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:29,059
so basically my auto watering system

728
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,950
with this water wand is I've got a trash

729
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,889
can on wheels I've marked it for volume

730
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:37,670
I fill it up to my desired level I add

731
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:41,000
and mix my nutrients I pH my solution

732
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,730
that means I adjust the pH to about 6-4

733
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,619
6-3 depending on what I'm feeding what

734
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,990
plants are getting fed I adjust my pH I

735
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,609
assemble the pump and my wand which

736
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,319
means I've got a pump I've got a hose

737
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:52,609
and I've got a water wand if you want to

738
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,230
put a little bit of plumber's tape in

739
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,089
there anywhere on any of those threads

740
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,819
to make sure they seal up real well feel

741
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,349
free to do that then drop that pump into

742
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,599
the water and plug it in and you can

743
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:05,179
water your plants in half the time I may

744
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,159
suggest that before you drop that pump

745
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,900
into your reservoir that you're gonna

746
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,790
water plants with maybe you put it in

747
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,830
another container and run water through

748
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,019
it just one time just to see if there's

749
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:16,369
any oils or anything left over I don't

750
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:18,019
know maybe there's something in there

751
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:19,250
from the manufacturing process that you

752
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:21,650
don't want getting into your plants

753
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,180
maybe clean it off one time I kind of

754
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,890
recommend cleaning [ __ ] out one time

755
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,320
before you use it in your grow anyway so

756
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,640
run some clean water through it just

757
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,809
make sure it's not gonna get oil or

758
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,430
anything in there I've seen one of these

759
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,589
pumps not a Maundy it was a different

760
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,029
and I saw it burn up in a reservoir and

761
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:36,319
a bunch of oil came out of it we saw it

762
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:37,910
all float to the top of the water

763
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,429
if Brian and I weren't paying attention

764
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,340
we may have fed that water to the plants

765
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,920
could have [ __ ] up an entire crop so

766
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:47,629
just a good idea to rinse that pump I'm

767
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,300
not saying it's got something on it but

768
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,980
it could so put everything together drop

769
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:54,409
that pump into the water and plug it in

770
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,940
now you can water your plants by picking

771
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,740
up that water wand and squeezing the

772
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,390
trigger and pointing it right into the

773
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,039
pot of the plant now you don't have to

774
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,390
go back to the reservoir between every

775
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,730
plant you don't have to carry a pitcher

776
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,590
of water from the reservoir to the plant

777
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,390
every time which is trips back and forth

778
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,859
which is you spilling water which is

779
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,690
inconsistent watering which is you

780
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,719
getting in a rush which is where a lot

781
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,710
of problems can go wrong you guys excuse

782
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,940
me for all the throat clearing I'm

783
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,740
trying not to do a lot of pausing and

784
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,880
editing on this show but my throat is

785
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,170
kind of burning so we're gonna take a

786
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,270
break here in a second take a drink and

787
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,860
a dad and we'll come back but I've been

788
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,839
talking a lot about consistency with

789
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:29,869
Auto watering here is a way to dial this

790
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,339
in with your water wand what were you

791
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:33,019
watering with before were you using a

792
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:34,490
pitcher we're using a jar we're using

793
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,920
one of those fancy watering cans from

794
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,440
Target ah whatever you were using get

795
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,259
your watering wand set that container on

796
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,610
a table and set a timer or a count just

797
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:44,930
count because you're gonna be doing this

798
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,009
hero on your own and your head anyway

799
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,660
when you're out in the grill when you're

800
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,589
when you get away from all the stuff and

801
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,140
you got your ear buds and you're gonna

802
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:53,389
be doing in your head so get that

803
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,740
container and use your water wand and

804
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,210
just start filling it and count how long

805
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,470
it takes count at your own pace but

806
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,620
count it the same pace all the time

807
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,660
you're not if you count it 1 2 3 4 5

808
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:05,029
make sure you always count like that but

809
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,170
if you count it 1 2 you can count it on

810
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,460
pace right now you're just measuring at

811
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,470
your own thing to make sure you count

812
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,289
the same all the time so see how long it

813
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,329
takes to fill it up 1 2 maybe it'll take

814
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:16,009
45 seconds to fill up that container if

815
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,779
that's the container you were using to

816
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,849
water your plants now you know it takes

817
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,500
the count of 45 to water your plants

818
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:26,449
with that water once you got to go stand

819
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,799
there for 45 1 2 3 but make sure you're

820
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,509
moving that water wander around the

821
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,299
plants the whole time so that your

822
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,879
moistening all of the medium the old

823
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,559
container needs to be evenly watered so

824
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,600
that's a good way to dial in how much

825
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,359
water you're giving per plant with the

826
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,750
water wand system so our basic shopping

827
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,819
list

828
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,869
to set up this trash can water wand

829
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:49,009
system

830
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:52,459
is a trash can wheels a Maundy pump a

831
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:54,910
good hose and a solid water wand you

832
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,410
should be able to set this up for around

833
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,509
$200 depending on where you find the

834
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,970
pump how long of a hose you get the

835
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:04,490
quality of the water wand and do you

836
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,190
need the dog washer attachment to get

837
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,900
that water to your reservoir so for

838
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,360
right around 200 bucks you can be

839
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,740
watering your plants with much more

840
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,779
efficiency you guys

841
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,730
my throat is mad at me I'm gonna press

842
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,589
pause for a couple of seconds I'm gonna

843
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,480
take a couple gigantic dabs at this Ken

844
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,039
brulee sauce I'm gonna get some water

845
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,200
and then I'll be back to talk about

846
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:28,420
building a reservoir and emitter style

847
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,420
drip system for your grow

848
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,969
[Music]

849
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:58,608
[Music]

850
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,108
[Music]

851
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,509
all right podcast world I am back let's

852
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,970
talk about building an auto watering

853
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:29,160
system in a commercial facility we try

854
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,980
to automate as much as possible to allow

855
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,840
for more canopy work defoliation bug

856
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,849
scouting whatever else needs to be done

857
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,769
that day a lot of cleaning and whatever

858
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:39,959
else we come up with on the daily to-do

859
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,389
list we'd like to have time to get all

860
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,700
of that stuff done so I use a water wand

861
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,370
and it can set up for our veg and moms

862
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,590
in a large but once we move into the

863
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:54,058
flower rooms every plant has an emitter

864
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:55,829
or two for automated watering designing

865
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:58,170
your watering system is going to vary

866
00:28:55,829 --> 00:29:00,359
greatly depending on your current Gro

867
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,210
setup and your ultimate goals remember

868
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,678
earlier we talked about having goals

869
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,380
this setup should give you a good idea

870
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,110
of how to start your design you will

871
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,940
need to modify and adjust and adapt to

872
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:13,289
your situation I don't know what your

873
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,880
grow room looks like I don't know what

874
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:16,829
your room is shaped like I don't know

875
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,740
how many plants you've got you may need

876
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:21,240
to make some decisions on the fly

877
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,400
because your grow rooms and the hardware

878
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,660
store are going to be different than

879
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,009
mine I don't know what's available at

880
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,110
your hardware store maybe you're not

881
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,970
shopping on Amazon I don't know what

882
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:31,558
you've got access to that day maybe you

883
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,539
live somewhere that ace is the place and

884
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,920
you can't go to Lowe's or Home Depot and

885
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,509
they've got different stuff than what I

886
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,519
recommend you may need to do some

887
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:42,240
adjusting so this is just going to be a

888
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,279
good guideline in my opinion now let's

889
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,529
start with a little bit of a plan how

890
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,690
many plants do you plan on watering and

891
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:52,940
how often to those plants need to be

892
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:54,048
watered how much water will that require

893
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,239
and now we need to start with a

894
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,308
reservoir large enough to water the

895
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:59,569
garden the amount of times so let's say

896
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:01,848
you're going on vacation let's just

897
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:03,378
hypothetically say your goal is to get

898
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:05,388
this through a week you're leaving

899
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:06,678
Monday you'll be back Friday you need

900
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:08,898
the plants to survive through the week

901
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,210
how much water will that take how many

902
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:14,268
times are your plants going to be

903
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,489
requiring water to last Monday Tuesday

904
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,960
Wednesday Thursday Friday and you're

905
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:19,460
probably not gonna get to him until

906
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,858
Saturday right so you get to water him

907
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,509
Sunday you got five full days how many

908
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,439
gallons of water do you need for those

909
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:26,690
plants to survive

910
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,330
make sure your reservoir that you select

911
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,210
is large enough to handle that much

912
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,158
water if that is your goal if you plan

913
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,720
on filling your reservoir everyday and

914
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,909
mixing nutrients and just feeding your

915
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,399
daily feed make sure it's big enough for

916
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:41,778
one or two feeds and you should be just

917
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,878
fine but if you plan on leaving town

918
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:45,829
you're gonna want a big reservoir so

919
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:47,689
that's why I'm talking about it now so

920
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,808
think about the reservoir size that you

921
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,720
need maybe a small brute trashcan is

922
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:55,308
enough maybe you want 50 to 100 gallons

923
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,839
that's up to you also keep in mind it's

924
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:58,668
got to fit through the door it's got to

925
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,709
go somewhere in the house it's got to

926
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:02,389
get into your facility somehow so make

927
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,879
sure you've got room for a big-ass

928
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:06,168
reservoir those 250 s of square 250 s

929
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:07,969
they don't fit through a standard door

930
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,960
so you need a rollup door or something

931
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,038
to get that [ __ ] in the facility so

932
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,139
keep in mind also that you're gonna need

933
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,638
to get water to this reservoir and like

934
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:18,888
I mentioned earlier sometimes that's not

935
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,898
as easy as it sounds now if you've got a

936
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:22,519
250 gallon reservoir that may end up in

937
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:24,798
the garage that may end up in an easier

938
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,298
place to access and the girl may be down

939
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,769
in the opposite into the house and the

940
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:29,898
basement they're gonna have to get that

941
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:31,220
water you're gonna have to get water to

942
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,538
the reservoir then you have to get it

943
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,819
all the way back to the basement just

944
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:36,618
think about these things so it all

945
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:39,138
starts with a reservoir and a way to get

946
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:40,848
water into our rez now you may need to

947
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:42,709
heat or to cool that rez depending on

948
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:43,848
where it is stored if it's out in the

949
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,200
garage the temperatures are gonna

950
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:46,548
fluctuate it's been a hundred and

951
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,080
something degrees here that water would

952
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:50,089
have been really hot we would have

953
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,058
wanted to cool it down in the winter

954
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,918
here [ __ ] in the indoor facilities here

955
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:56,509
I'm heating water it gets so cold

956
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,299
outside that the water that comes in

957
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:01,460
through the pipes is ridiculously cold

958
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:03,288
it comes in at like 50 degrees stick

959
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,970
your hand in that 50 degree water no

960
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,499
thank you it's so cold at almost [ __ ]

961
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,710
Hertz we got to heat it up we gotta get

962
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,899
that

963
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,399
water around 70 75 degrees before we

964
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:12,048
feed it to the plants that makes them

965
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,489
much happier if you're using a hydro

966
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:14,509
system yes you do want your water cooler

967
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,009
don't correct me there we're just

968
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:17,778
talking about this drip system for today

969
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:19,099
so we want to get the water to the right

970
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,538
temperature you may need to heat or

971
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:22,278
chill it get yourself a chiller or a

972
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,319
water heater and be careful with those

973
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:27,798
things dial them in to the temperature

974
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,329
that you do desire also you may need a

975
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:31,250
smaller pump inside of your large

976
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:32,808
reservoir to help keep your nutrient

977
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,970
solution mixed properly and to prevent

978
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:36,440
that water from getting stagnant just

979
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,429
put a little like a fish tank pump or

980
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,558
something in there just to keep the

981
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:40,909
water moving around a little bit all

982
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,769
right so now we've got a reservoir that

983
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:44,870
we can mix our nutrients into we can

984
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:46,908
fill up with either RO water or

985
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,069
municipal water we can get water to it

986
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:51,770
now that's the first part is having a

987
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:55,428
reservoir filled with water our next

988
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:57,349
step once again we need a pump your pump

989
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,990
size is going to depend on the amount of

990
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:02,119
plants the amount of emitters and how

991
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,519
far your water needs to travel to get to

992
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,709
those plants if you're going up if you

993
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,990
have to pump uphill straight up you need

994
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,659
a much stronger pump than if you're just

995
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,370
pumping horizontal if you're pumping

996
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,409
vertical you need a stronger pump it

997
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:17,269
takes a lot of pressure to push water up

998
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:19,970
but if you're just going horizontal or

999
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:22,788
down you can use a less powerful pump

1000
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,829
your pump is going to depend on like I

1001
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:27,079
said the distance and the amount of

1002
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:29,089
plants so do you more emitters you're

1003
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,668
gonna need a stronger pump longer travel

1004
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:33,319
stronger pump vertical climb much

1005
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:34,460
stronger pump you're gonna have to think

1006
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,558
about this when you're designing your

1007
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,220
room do a little research on horsepowers

1008
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,950
of pumps

1009
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,169
it's better to have too much pressure as

1010
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,028
opposed to too little pressure low

1011
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,890
pressure won't work at all too little

1012
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:47,329
pressure those emitters basically

1013
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,470
regulate themselves unless you're going

1014
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:50,449
crazy then you're gonna blow it apart

1015
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,919
but just a little bit too much pressure

1016
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,630
and those little emitters will regulate

1017
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,899
your cell themselves and you'll be just

1018
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,539
fine

1019
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:58,668
so so far it's pretty basic you've got a

1020
00:33:56,538 --> 00:34:00,950
pump and you've got a reservoir and make

1021
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,149
sure that reservoir is fillable maybe if

1022
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,220
you've got a way to clean that would be

1023
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:06,558
a good idea also just keep that sort of

1024
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,329
stuff in mind from the beginning so this

1025
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:12,409
is where it starts getting into some

1026
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:16,069
work I would run PVC from that

1027
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,570
submersible pump to an inline filter so

1028
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,169
most of the time this is how I do it

1029
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,570
I run PVC coming up directly up appa off

1030
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:26,539
of the pump then you use two 90 degrees

1031
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,919
to make it go back down it comes up and

1032
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:29,869
then it goes around to the edge of the

1033
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,819
reservoir the trash can and then it goes

1034
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,079
just straight back down now you may need

1035
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,149
to add some distance here if your

1036
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:36,588
reservoir is wide or if your pump is in

1037
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:38,509
the middle and then it comes up and then

1038
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:40,099
you go a 90 degree and then you may have

1039
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,450
to go a couple feet to get off the edge

1040
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,250
of that reservoir and then you do

1041
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,539
another 90 to go down toward the ground

1042
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,829
and then on your way to the ground

1043
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:48,398
that's where you're going to put that

1044
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,398
filter that filters

1045
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,320
so that shine or whatever sediment

1046
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,789
you've got coming through the line the

1047
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,350
thick stuff will get caught by the

1048
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,759
inline filter and it will make it down

1049
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,429
to your emitters and clog up your

1050
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,900
emitters so now the line the PVC line

1051
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:08,639
that was coming to that filter was

1052
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,470
running down toward the ground just keep

1053
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,659
running back to the ground until you get

1054
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:15,029
to the floor and then use a 90 to point

1055
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,559
it whichever direction you need it or if

1056
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,570
you've got a long way to go or if you're

1057
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,519
going into another room just simply use

1058
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,620
PVC to route it to where you need it

1059
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,719
just do some plumbing work build

1060
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,759
yourself a little a water line to

1061
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,559
wherever you need it use 90 degrees 45

1062
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,720
degree angles just make sure you prime

1063
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,130
and glue every spot carefully so that

1064
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,899
you don't get any leaks so just build

1065
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,630
yourself a little pathway to get that

1066
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,420
water to where you need it now this PVC

1067
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,970
I'm talking about can vary in size based

1068
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,680
on your watering needs anywhere from one

1069
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:46,319
inch to one and a half inch to three

1070
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,000
inch PVC could be used depending on the

1071
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,160
size of your garden and how much water

1072
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,349
flow you need if you're using a large

1073
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,690
facility you may be pumping this water a

1074
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,819
long distance just from your reservoir

1075
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,010
all the way down the hallway all the way

1076
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,780
to the grow room around the corner out

1077
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,220
to where it gets dispersed and then down

1078
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,230
to each table you're gonna need a

1079
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,239
stronger pump for that so make sure your

1080
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,429
pump is equipped for how much water

1081
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,319
you're moving and the distance that it

1082
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:12,509
has to go if you're going to set up

1083
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,300
different rooms with the same pump just

1084
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:17,670
use ball valves so that you can turn off

1085
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,160
so you'll have a it'll come from the

1086
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,170
pump up to one valve and then you'll

1087
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,670
have three on and off switches and you

1088
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,050
just turn the ones off where you don't

1089
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,280
want the water to flow and the water off

1090
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,470
where you want it to go so you can

1091
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,960
select which room so just use ball

1092
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:32,789
valves to control the flow to each room

1093
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,010
use tees and ball valves that way you

1094
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:36,509
can have one pump that you can water

1095
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,300
every room from but you'll have to do

1096
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,850
one room at a time all right so we've

1097
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:46,110
got a big reservoir we have got a pump

1098
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:50,579
inside that pump has hose coming off of

1099
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:51,900
it that gets us to a filter that filter

1100
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,069
will save your life in the future by the

1101
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,660
way it's gonna save you so much trouble

1102
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,490
so you got a res with the pump leading

1103
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,519
to a filter from the filter we've got

1104
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:01,799
PVC leading us to the plant area now

1105
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,659
this description is how I do tables we

1106
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,610
can talk about building the tables and

1107
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,440
adjusting this to a floor plan or other

1108
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,099
options once we get the general idea

1109
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,470
down

1110
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,449
but this is how I do it using greenhouse

1111
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,549
style irrigation tables the plants are

1112
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:16,109
in three gallon pots they're in Cocoa

1113
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,390
they're sitting on tables the tables are

1114
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,130
slightly slanted toward the water runs

1115
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:23,389
down to one end and it drains out of the

1116
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,390
end so I never have water city

1117
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,019
so we've talked about getting the pump

1118
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:33,879
pumping water into the room usually I've

1119
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,800
got the water coming into the room about

1120
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,510
seven feet high so it's above my head

1121
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,120
I've got a pipe running horizontally

1122
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,100
across a lot of the facility just

1123
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,019
running water all over the place seven

1124
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,460
eight feet high then it comes into the

1125
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:47,440
grow room about seven or eight feet high

1126
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,000
this is just for my set up I'm telling

1127
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,210
you how we do it in a commercial

1128
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,619
facility about eight feet high the water

1129
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,720
there's a water line you could just see

1130
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,920
it a PVC tube this is a thick PVC tube

1131
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,929
because we're running a lot of water

1132
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,510
yours doesn't need to be this big then

1133
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:04,599
for each table there's a tea coming off

1134
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:07,210
of that main line so what tea comes off

1135
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,980
and off of that tea I use flex hose that

1136
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,699
fits off of that intersection and that

1137
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,170
flex hose arches from the eight foot

1138
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:17,379
seven or eight foot spot above my head

1139
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:20,110
it creates an arch down to the end of

1140
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,760
the table now that is out of my way I

1141
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,230
can walk under that because it goes

1142
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,610
right at the end of the table it just

1143
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,829
bends perfect like I'm just walking

1144
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,120
under a little bridge it's perfectly so

1145
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:29,380
it's seven or eight feet above me and

1146
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,809
then it is arches to the end of the

1147
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,349
table where it comes to another tea

1148
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,349
section

1149
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,449
you

1150
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,350
that piece of flex hose then reaches

1151
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,630
another t-intersection where I have

1152
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:54,029
about a three foot section of PVC that

1153
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,130
lays on my table my table is five or six

1154
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,830
feet wide I use about a three three and

1155
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,950
a half foot section to start building my

1156
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,900
table watering system there is a tee and

1157
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:07,669
the very center of this three-foot

1158
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,670
section of PVC where my

1159
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,300
so that PVC just rests freely on the

1160
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,890
table it basically sits centered it's

1161
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,450
not the width of the table but it's

1162
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:18,730
close the table is five or six feet long

1163
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:20,349
this piece of PVC would be about three

1164
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,240
three and a half feet long and it would

1165
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:23,799
sit the width of the table and that is

1166
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,689
basically the start of my water

1167
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,430
distribution now if you're doing

1168
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:31,929
multiple tables here is an important

1169
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:33,909
detail between the Flex hose and that

1170
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:36,190
t-intersection where do you meet the PVC

1171
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:38,409
give yourself a ball valve to turn that

1172
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,119
off and on so if you're gonna water more

1173
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,469
than if you've got two or three tables

1174
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,900
in there maybe you only want a water

1175
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:46,359
table one or table two or table three if

1176
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,130
you've got ball valves to each table you

1177
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,960
can turn off each table and you won't

1178
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,640
have to worry about watering the wrong

1179
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,720
table with the wrong nutrients so that

1180
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,150
will come to your advantage

1181
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,819
wherever you can put a ball valve to

1182
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,250
control water why not do it wherever you

1183
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,809
can put a little union like a if you

1184
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,130
when you start building PVC stuff you'll

1185
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:05,230
you'll learn what unions are wherever

1186
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,880
you can put a union why not do it to

1187
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,070
save yourself some time in the future so

1188
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,420
think about ball valves and unions those

1189
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,740
will come into mind once you built a

1190
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,510
couple of these systems if you've done

1191
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:15,309
some PVC building that already rings

1192
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,450
stuff to you but it's just advanced

1193
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:18,449
stuff that's gonna help you out so

1194
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,670
you

1195
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:16,469
so now I've got my intersection where my

1196
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:17,969
water feeds it leads into my table I've

1197
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:19,318
got my ball valve so I could turn it off

1198
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:21,358
and on let's not forget that like I

1199
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:24,528
almost did it branches off a foot and a

1200
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,528
half maybe two feet on you

1201
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,849
you

1202
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:43,659
now onto that you're going to

1203
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,920
you

1204
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,329
I know it sounds a little sketchy to

1205
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,400
start but once you see how it works it

1206
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:03,819
totally makes a lot of sense so you need

1207
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,820
poly tubing depending on the size of

1208
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:10,240
your grow the PVC and the poly tubing

1209
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,280
you use may vary anywhere from a half of

1210
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,839
an inch to one and a half inches you're

1211
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,360
just gonna have to think about how much

1212
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:20,050
water you need to move and how big of a

1213
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,849
pump you want to use in your setup so to

1214
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,100
get back where we were we've got our

1215
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:25,659
line coming off the wall we've got our

1216
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,670
t-intersection then we've got our 90

1217
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,960
degrees with our little inserts glued

1218
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,579
into there and everything is glued

1219
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,690
everything has been primed and glued all

1220
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,219
the way back to the wall we're doing

1221
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,960
this as we go so we don't get any leaks

1222
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:36,069
everything is primed and glued we've got

1223
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,849
our 90-degree angles

1224
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,850
pointing down

1225
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,570
you

1226
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,530
right down between the pots just so

1227
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,609
right I'm gonna run mine down the length

1228
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,750
of the table because that's what I'm

1229
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,550
doing I'm gonna get it down the table

1230
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,409
then I'm gonna put two more of those

1231
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,700
90-degree angles at the end you use the

1232
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:16,289
90-degree angle you have to put an

1233
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,149
insert in one end of it prime it and

1234
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:19,559
glue it then that pops into your poly

1235
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,240
tubing you can either prime and glue

1236
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,500
that or put a hose clamp on there I do

1237
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,849
both because that's where it's gonna

1238
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,110
come undone when two different kind of

1239
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,239
materials meet that's where the glue

1240
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,880
likes to fail so I Prime and glue it I

1241
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,709
put a hose clamp on there then I just do

1242
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,940
another piece of PVC across the same

1243
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,280
length is the one I used at the other

1244
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,139
end probably three feet long do another

1245
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,910
one and then do repeat my 90 degree

1246
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:40,799
angle again and then I roll my poly

1247
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,170
tubing out to match so now I've built a

1248
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,030
square so now basically I've got water

1249
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,039
coming from the reservoir it comes along

1250
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,900
the wall comes into the room comes from

1251
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,210
eight feet above me branches off the

1252
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,889
wall goes down the Flex tubing goes to

1253
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,309
the ball valve that I can turn off and

1254
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:58,589
on then it goes to the T section of PVC

1255
00:43:56,309 --> 00:44:00,630
then it runs down the length of my table

1256
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:02,039
then it goes back and meets itself at

1257
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,050
that square because it cuts off there's

1258
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,329
nowhere for the water to go now this

1259
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,010
helps create pressure instead of just

1260
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:09,960
having one line running down the middle

1261
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,790
with lines coming off of it we've got a

1262
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,079
little bit of equalized pressure and

1263
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,699
this will help spread the water out

1264
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,710
amongst the plants a little more evenly

1265
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,989
also since we've got such a long table

1266
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:20,280
we'd rather have two lines coming off so

1267
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,199
that we can have emitters off of two

1268
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,240
different lines and not have really long

1269
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:27,379
spaghetti lines we've just got two mains

1270
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,379
to pipe off of

1271
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,529
you

1272
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,630
here is where having a solid plan will

1273
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,099
come in handy hopefully you drew all

1274
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,500
this out before we started building

1275
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:56,179
hopefully you measured twice cut once

1276
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,860
before we lay it out all the tubing

1277
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:59,869
hopefully everything went well with that

1278
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,030
but now you really need to think about

1279
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:04,069
where you're going to place your plants

1280
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,500
if you need to place the plants now

1281
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,510
before you start making your punctures

1282
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,190
to insert your emitters it may be a wise

1283
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,050
move to have the plants in place if

1284
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:14,389
you've done this before if you know how

1285
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,100
many plants fit and how much space then

1286
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:17,989
you can probably do the math on that but

1287
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:19,699
I would set the plants in place if

1288
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:22,579
you've got a table I know that this

1289
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:24,529
section this I think it's a six by now

1290
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,329
it's got to be 8 by 6 section I think I

1291
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,190
can fit 15 to 18 plants in there

1292
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,230
depending on the strain so I would think

1293
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,970
about I need to get 15 emitters in here

1294
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:35,059
where am I gonna put these plants I

1295
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:37,369
would put 3 rows of 5 right so I'm going

1296
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:39,820
to need 15 minutes I do 7 coming off of

1297
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,819
this side

1298
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:48,349
so before you go puncturing think about

1299
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,660
how many plants on each side and think

1300
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:52,250
about how far apart they're gonna be if

1301
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:54,019
you do make punctures you decide you

1302
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,969
don't need they do sell little caps that

1303
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,590
just pop right into those holes or you

1304
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:58,819
can just run spaghetti Lyon off of it

1305
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,950
and then crimp it and put a hose clamp

1306
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,860
around it you'll be just fine but it's

1307
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:05,139
easier to not punch extra holes so the

1308
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,950
emitters are gonna be coming off of

1309
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:08,839
quarter inch tubing there are little

1310
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:10,609
sprinklers those come off of quarter

1311
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,610
inch tubing that quarter inch tubing is

1312
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:15,710
attached to our mainline that line

1313
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:19,960
you've got running down the table that

1314
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,960
poly line the emitters come out of there

1315
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,059
you

1316
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:04,449
and the steak you need to insert it into

1317
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:04,450
the plant all preassembled

1318
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,340
you

1319
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,019
pretty close to the same length that way

1320
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,730
you can keep all the water pressure the

1321
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:19,440
same everywhere you don't get any weird

1322
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:21,420
over or under watering because you've

1323
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,920
got some lines that are too long all

1324
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,750
right I got way sidetracked let's try to

1325
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,760
get back to where I was we've got the

1326
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,889
the poly tubing we're gonna puncture a

1327
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,300
little hole and that poly tubing with

1328
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:32,699
the tool that they sell it's really easy

1329
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,810
you just smack the little you can set it

1330
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:35,250
right on the tubing and hit it with your

1331
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,989
other hand if you want to to make a go

1332
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,579
through or just push it right on through

1333
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:40,409
it takes a little bit of strength but

1334
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:43,319
you should be able to get it so you

1335
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:44,909
puncture the tubing then you basically

1336
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,410
insert the Barb it takes a little

1337
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:48,420
pressure it might hurt your thumbs they

1338
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:50,639
do sell a tool you can use pliers get

1339
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,740
that little barb in there determine how

1340
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,049
long you need your tubing and cut it to

1341
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:57,299
length try to cut them all similarly

1342
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:59,850
like I said or buy pre-cut that's always

1343
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,550
more convenient then insert your chosen

1344
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,110
emitter onto the end of that tubing that

1345
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,210
emitter like I said a minute ago is

1346
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,490
going to need a steak or some sort of

1347
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,130
platform to be inserted into your soil

1348
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:12,779
or cocoa or medium of choice to keep it

1349
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,030
in place it's not just gonna stay there

1350
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,710
by itself a sprinkler head on a tube it

1351
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,320
needs some sort of a support or some

1352
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,820
sort of placer so all this stuff is in

1353
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,580
the irrigation section at whichever

1354
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,140
hardware store you choose but let's talk

1355
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,090
about the emitters to get because there

1356
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:29,460
are a ton of confusing options and I'll

1357
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:32,670
tell you exactly what I buy and then

1358
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:36,510
this may help you out I like the maxi

1359
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:56,000
jet Maxx cone fan 360s and those are

1360
00:48:36,510 --> 00:49:01,230
available at www.att.com/biz em a b-36

1361
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,420
d1 so I guess major alpha Bravo 36 Delta

1362
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:05,280
one just to make that super clear

1363
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,930
because I do speak with the weird tone

1364
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,390
sometimes but that's the part number you

1365
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:11,429
need there is a riser recommended on the

1366
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:13,170
same page that matches that emitter I

1367
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:15,419
would recommend that that's what you

1368
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,990
need to insert your emitter into the

1369
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:20,190
soil

1370
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:21,809
there are similar emitters on Amazon but

1371
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,929
they are blue and they are twelve

1372
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:26,139
limiters for 1995 I think those are the

1373
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:28,268
same thing but the discreet

1374
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:30,548
doesn't give me as many details as the

1375
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:32,078
others I recommended from Maxie jet so

1376
00:49:30,548 --> 00:49:33,400
maybe that'll help you out if you don't

1377
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,990
want to buy as many as they sell on

1378
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,818
Maxie jet I think you have to buy fifty

1379
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:38,858
or a hundred from their Amazon you can

1380
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:41,558
get twelve of them that should work for

1381
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:43,210
you the Maxie jet are the emitters I

1382
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,099
recommend but there are tons of other

1383
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,460
options that may work better for you

1384
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:50,440
they do sell kits that you can buy to

1385
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,119
irrigate your garden the little kits

1386
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,920
that they sell to irrigate your outdoor

1387
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,390
flower garden those are work in your pot

1388
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,010
garden at home if you have a small

1389
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:58,538
garden and you want to experiment with

1390
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,069
something like this you don't have to

1391
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:01,750
build everything this is kind of a fun

1392
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:03,190
way to do it this is what we would do in

1393
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,349
a commercial facility those little kits

1394
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,568
they sell that wouldn't work for me in a

1395
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:09,190
long 45 foot table that may work for you

1396
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:10,960
and your small home grow look at those

1397
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,429
before you go building all this they're

1398
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,139
gonna be right next to all this stuff

1399
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,730
that I'm telling you to buy anyway so

1400
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:18,038
you'll be in that department anyway

1401
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:19,719
let's get back to where I was emitters

1402
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,250
there are several emitter options I told

1403
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:23,709
you what I like I told you what I buy I

1404
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,358
told you what I use like I said earlier

1405
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,889
this is all customizable if you like

1406
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,588
something different I encourage you to

1407
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:31,989
use what you like maybe you want to

1408
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:34,028
experiment with emitters maybe once you

1409
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:35,739
get your whole system set up before you

1410
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:37,659
start puncturing a bunch of holes

1411
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:39,939
maybe you just puncture one hole and you

1412
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,429
have one grommet or one nipple

1413
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,599
with one line coming off of it where you

1414
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:45,518
just try a whole bunch of different

1415
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,019
emitter style you can just put one on

1416
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:49,000
turn on the water and see what it's like

1417
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:50,649
see if you like it or not turn the water

1418
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,849
off pop another one on let's just start

1419
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,740
comparing see which one you like the

1420
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:56,019
best know when you're doing that keep in

1421
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:58,479
mind that when you add multiple emitters

1422
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:59,768
and multiple punctures you're gonna lose

1423
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,269
water pressure because you got pressure

1424
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:03,639
coming out of more spots but you should

1425
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:06,879
get a general idea of what the emitters

1426
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,078
are going to do so figure out what kind

1427
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,490
you're gonna use before you start punk

1428
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,009
puncturing a bunch of holes in your in

1429
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:13,598
your poly tubing and once you've found

1430
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:14,500
and selected the appropriate emitters

1431
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,420
that you like and that you're

1432
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,730
comfortable with and confident in find

1433
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,369
the appropriate risers or stakes insert

1434
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:23,679
those emitters into your plants I insert

1435
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,480
one emitter per plant when I'm using a

1436
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,129
three gallon pot and I usually need to

1437
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,809
water once or twice a day and I grow

1438
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,180
pretty large plants in a commercial

1439
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:32,950
facility under double-ended Gavita

1440
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:35,710
lights so that's a lot of light there's

1441
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:37,598
a lot of action one emitter is usually

1442
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:39,470
enough for me now let's talk about

1443
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,450
placing the emitter we want to

1444
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:43,459
the entire pot we don't just want to

1445
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:45,289
water the left side or the right side so

1446
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,030
try to stick that emitter as close to

1447
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:48,590
the center of the plant as you can get

1448
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,150
try to get it right next to the stock I

1449
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,230
know that may be hard you don't want to

1450
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,730
puncture the roots you don't want to

1451
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,409
tear up the roots a whole lot but you

1452
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,880
want to get that stake right in there

1453
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:57,289
close to the center of the plant so when

1454
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,450
you turn on the sprinklers it waters

1455
00:51:57,289 --> 00:52:00,800
that whole pot as much as you can think

1456
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,389
about that when you're placing them if

1457
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,160
you've got a crew if you've got a staff

1458
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:06,559
out there replacing sprinklers try to

1459
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,839
train them on placing them near the

1460
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,489
center that's important all right I feel

1461
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,650
like we've covered most of building a

1462
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:13,909
drip system or an auto watering system

1463
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,490
we've gotten all the way to placing the

1464
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:18,559
sprinklers right near the stock of the

1465
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:21,139
plants let's recap a little bit and then

1466
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,549
we will dial this system in before we

1467
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:24,589
start like I said measure everything

1468
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,119
multiple times before you cut anything

1469
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,349
if you've got tables make sure you cut

1470
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,119
your tubing to the right length if

1471
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:30,289
you're growing along the floor make sure

1472
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,050
you cut your tubing to the right length

1473
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:35,090
measure twice cut once then you'll have

1474
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,500
to buy the supplies one time how many

1475
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,670
times if you cut something too short and

1476
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,010
had to go back to the store and buy a

1477
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,690
new [ __ ] don't do that to yourself maybe

1478
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,400
dry yourself a good plan before you get

1479
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,869
started if you've got a helper go over

1480
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,150
the plan with them so you both know the

1481
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:48,680
goal once you're confident measure cut

1482
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,750
and assemble your system make sure you

1483
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,730
glue everything if you're confident

1484
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,500
everything is primed and glued and all

1485
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,789
your hose clamps are secure and that

1486
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,858
you've got all your emitters in place

1487
00:52:55,789 --> 00:53:02,750
properly then it's time to test your

1488
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:04,549
system ah fill up your reservoir plug in

1489
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,369
your pump and then go run down to the

1490
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,050
grower room and see if the water is

1491
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:10,400
coming out of the emitters check for

1492
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,859
leaks all along the way

1493
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,389
start at the pump work your way all the

1494
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:17,059
way down and see if anything is leaking

1495
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:19,460
look for water on the floor look for

1496
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:21,380
spraying listen you'll know if it's

1497
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,880
leaking pay attention then go pay

1498
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,400
attention to every emitter make sure the

1499
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,920
water is coming out of every emitter now

1500
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,720
is the time to identify and correct your

1501
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,280
problems if you haven't already put the

1502
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,539
plants in the room to judge your spacing

1503
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
now is the time to put the plants in the

1504
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:36,619
room and start sticking those emitters

1505
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,780
in the plants and now you have basically

1506
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:40,670
completed setting up an auto water

1507
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,440
system let's talk about a couple of

1508
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,570
different things now do you want this

1509
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,460
system to water at a certain time in the

1510
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:48,500
morning without you there you can have

1511
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,599
this just when the lights come on you

1512
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,489
can make this water or do you want to be

1513
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,220
there when this happens to make this

1514
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:55,949
happen when you're

1515
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,899
there is really easy makes up your

1516
00:53:55,949 --> 00:54:00,269
reservoir with the desired nutrients

1517
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,309
have your pH and your ppm say how you

1518
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:03,750
want to have a mix pump in there so that

1519
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:05,400
[ __ ] keeps stirring through the night so

1520
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,250
nothing gets settled so that it just

1521
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,889
stays stays cycled up all the time then

1522
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:14,070
have a timer on your pump your light

1523
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:16,049
comes on at 9:00 and 9 o'clock have that

1524
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,090
pump trigger - and now it'll just run

1525
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,440
that water and it'll water your plants

1526
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,090
for you while you're at work while

1527
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,920
you're on vacation while you're sleeping

1528
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,559
right through it now the thing you're

1529
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,150
gonna have to do is dial in how long you

1530
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,858
run that pump because if you just turn

1531
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,780
it on and let it run it will run until

1532
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:32,549
it's out of water if you've got 20

1533
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,200
gallons in there and it only takes 10

1534
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,320
gallons to water your room you're gonna

1535
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:39,299
overflow so here's what you got to do

1536
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,760
start keeping a timer every time you

1537
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:46,550
water your plants get those emitters in

1538
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,550
there set a little timer hit go on the

1539
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:53,130
you

1540
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,140
now sometimes your emitters are going to

1541
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,210
get clogged we do have that filter down

1542
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:45,289
at the end sometimes little [ __ ] passes

1543
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,970
through there and it builds up in that

1544
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,829
emitter that's not a big deal

1545
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,750
simply turn off the water take off that

1546
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:52,219
emitter get something a little tiny and

1547
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,929
just poke it out you just put a little

1548
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,929
pokey in there just something like a

1549
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:59,419
wire brush bristle just poke it out

1550
00:55:55,929 --> 00:56:00,980
oftentimes I buy them in bulk so I just

1551
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,900
have another emitter ready to go I pop

1552
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,699
one out pop a fresh one in I put those

1553
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,260
dirty ones in a pile when somebody

1554
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,399
doesn't have something to do that's when

1555
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,230
they go along and just clean all that

1556
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,970
kind of stuff maybe just throw that in a

1557
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,380
bucket with some fisa and some water let

1558
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:14,029
it kind of clean up for you while you're

1559
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,110
not even there go back and give them a

1560
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,880
rinse and they're clean you can use

1561
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,349
those as your replacement emitters next

1562
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,780
time so those are gonna have to be

1563
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:22,460
replaced to pay attention every day to

1564
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,960
clogged emitters because your plant will

1565
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,519
not get watered if that emitter is

1566
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,519
clogged also pave

1567
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:34,130
- a clogged emitter over all your plants

1568
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:35,568
should really love an automated watering

1569
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,490
system it's going to be more consistent

1570
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:39,199
it's gonna be more even the plants are

1571
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:40,429
gonna get the right amount of water you

1572
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,048
should like it because you're gonna save

1573
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:42,858
time you're gonna save energy you're

1574
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:44,989
gonna save water

1575
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:47,058
you'll probably save nutrients you'll

1576
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:48,108
see an increase in production and your

1577
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:49,790
plants you'll see an increase in

1578
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:51,949
performance and your plants and you'll

1579
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:53,389
have time to do some of those details I

1580
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:55,338
tell you about that you say when am I

1581
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:57,170
gonna ever do that you're gonna do that

1582
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:59,679
right after you get this drip system

1583
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,680
dialed in

1584
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:06,989
you

1585
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:04,710
you can set up as many of those in a row

1586
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:07,250
as you want you can set them up as many

1587
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:09,900
wide as you want just a basic 4 by 8

1588
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,309
botanic air flood tray on cinder blocks

1589
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
the cinder blocks are a little bit

1590
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:14,099
taller than a five-gallon bucket so you

1591
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,809
could slide the bucket under there to

1592
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,430
catch the runoff and then you can just

1593
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:18,839
run your poly tubing right down these

1594
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,519
four by eight tables like I was talking

1595
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,469
about earlier you guys you can make

1596
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:23,940
these as ghetto or as fancy as you'd

1597
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:26,129
like and they're still gonna do the same

1598
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,809
thing if it works for you that's what

1599
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:30,450
matters you can build a trellis system

1600
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:32,280
around it by putting PVC pipes in a

1601
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:34,019
five-gallon bucket fill that five-gallon

1602
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,300
bucket up with cement just go get some

1603
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:37,650
quikrete from Lowe's or Home Depot pour

1604
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,150
it right into the bucket I just let it

1605
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,250
harden right in the bucket there with a

1606
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:42,838
pole a PVC pole six or eight feet tall

1607
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,789
sticking right out of it and now you've

1608
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:46,500
got a steady pole put those in each

1609
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:47,009
corner and then just run your trellising

1610
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,539
on there

1611
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,369
and that's a really affordable way to

1612
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:52,588
make yourself a greenhouse style flood

1613
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:53,490
table with an auto watering system and

1614
00:58:52,588 --> 00:58:55,619
then you can go ahead and throw

1615
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:57,629
trellising bars up on there and it's

1616
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:59,400
really affordable and it'll work for you

1617
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,619
it doesn't have to look super fancy it

1618
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,660
will get the job done all right you guys

1619
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,369
don't be afraid to adjust adapt and

1620
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:07,588
customize any of the things that I said

1621
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:09,329
in this episode you might need longer or

1622
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:11,759
shorter tubing you may need thicker or

1623
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:13,170
skinnier tubing you may need more

1624
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,940
emitters you may like different

1625
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,619
sprinklers than me this is just a good

1626
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,409
idea of how to get it started do what

1627
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:21,869
works for you experiment and have fun

1628
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:23,460
this does sound a lot like a lot of work

1629
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,780
and it does sound kind of intimidating

1630
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,429
but I promise that once you go to the

1631
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,839
hardware store and you get started and

1632
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:29,548
you get that pump in your hand and

1633
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,980
you're like I've got the start then it's

1634
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:33,809
all going to come together so easily and

1635
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,789
it will be a fun project for you and a

1636
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:38,069
friend I hope so don't let a little work

1637
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:39,599
scare you away from automation it's

1638
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:42,119
really not that hard and it will pay off

1639
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,440
huge in the long run are you guys I've

1640
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:45,119
