20 so thank you for all of that feedback

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,280
all of those responses i did get a lot

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
of questions about reversing a male

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
plant a previous episode was about

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,400
pollinating a male plant with another

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
meal plant i did explain that that

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,959
simply isn't possible that is a sword

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,719
fight i also did get a lot of messages

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
saying maybe you could reverse a male

59
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,239
i'm going to talk about that in the

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
future i did add that to my notes that

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400
is upcoming in the future so stay tuned

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,479
there will be an episode with a little

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
bit of talk about reversing a male plant

64
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,119
to see maybe what it might look like as

65
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,719
a female plant now before i get any

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,879
where was i i was talking about strain

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,199
names i'm trying to name some new

132
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,879
strains and i've uh started doing a

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,319
thing when i make a new line of crosses

134
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,478
i'll take a male plant and pollinate

135
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,719
multiple females then that batch of

136
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,120
seeds will all get named kind of by the

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,639
same sort of a theme i've got some femme

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,478
seeds that will be coming out very soon

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,560
they are all kind of loosely named after

140
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
fish songs i'm sure you noticed a lot of

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
the grateful dead femme maybe you didn't

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,399
notice a lot of my grateful dead a

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
grateful dog feminized crosses were

144
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,239
named after reggae artists so i tried to

145
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,839
kind of bulk them into a group that

146
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,079
helps me remember what they are it helps

147
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,679
me identify what they are uh also it

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,240
helps other people associate with them

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,199
there was also the tmnt line we had

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,879
raphael donatello leonardo michelangelo

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
there was shredder bebop rocksteady it

152
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,959
made it really easy to just say is the

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,959
tmnt line sold out you knew that that

154
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,120
was all the reversed blueberries cross

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,879
now all of the fish stuff is actually a

156
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,959
reversed afterglow cross i took the

157
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,399
afterglow uh reversed that pollinated a

158
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,560
bunch of stuff all the things from there

159
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,239
got named or are being named loosely

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
named after fish

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
songs or fish associations we'll talk

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
about that in the future

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,439
some people will understand what the

164
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,758
rhombus is and some people simply will

165
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,199
not i am rambling my point is thank you

166
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,038
for the help in naming strain names i

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
feel like a lot of the good [ __ ] is

168
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,318
taken and when people try to give me

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
strain name suggestions they say things

170
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,960
that are already completely taken

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
because we're running out of all the

172
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,000
cool [ __ ] i do appreciate the help i

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,560
feel that naming a strain can almost

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,478
make or break that strain if a really

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,319
killer strain a really good cross has um

176
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,800
a bad name or an unappealing or a

177
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
non-desirable name people just don't buy

178
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199
it as much as they would across with a

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
really cool name sometimes i think i've

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,680
got the greatest name ideas and it just

181
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,680
doesn't work ah soccer souffle in the

182
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,478
machine for example those are those were

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,319
made together in the same run um and

184
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,318
they are both kind of named after

185
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
tributes to two of my favorite comedians

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,960
saka souffle of course is a joke from

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
tom segura and larry king and then the

188
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
machine as burke crusher's puts one of

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
his most popular jokes ever that's where

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,639
those names came from the machine sells

191
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,638
very well people don't know what the

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,038
hell saka souffle means so they just

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
don't buy those seeds both crosses are

194
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,159
equally

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,240
equally powerful equally as potent

196
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
equally they're both bad ass crosses i'm

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
equally proud of both of them but since

198
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
i named one saka souffle i've got a lot

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
of seeds of that one since i named one

200
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,598
the machine i don't have as many seeds

201
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,399
of that left so that is a good example

202
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,439
of how a strain name can make or break a

203
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,839
cross

204
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,598
strawberry starburst sells real well sun

205
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,519
kiss doesn't sell as well i think

206
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,279
they're equally potent equally powerful

207
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,000
plants and seeds but because of the

208
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,318
names they simply don't sell as much

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,918
scarlet begonias that's a grateful dead

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
song i named that after a grateful dead

211
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,598
song it doesn't sell as well as some

212
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,120
other things and it is i think it was

213
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,639
really missed i think it was slept on

214
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
that one should have been more popular

215
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,759
people didn't buy it i think because of

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,439
the name of the strain so um naming a

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,120
strain can be difficult naming a strain

218
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,959
can make or break the strain in my

219
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,959
opinion some people i had a strain

220
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,159
called bounty killer a long time ago and

221
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,439
a friend of mine didn't want to grow it

222
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
because she said the name was too

223
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,719
aggressive and she didn't want to tell

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
people she was growing bounty killer i

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
named that after a reggae artist named

226
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,038
bounty killer

227
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,519
and i called it bounty killer because

228
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,519
they gave me gigantic buds the bounty

229
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,439
was beautiful it was a bounty killer

230
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,918
also reggae artist influence name and

231
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,000
there that's where that came from anyway

232
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,839
my main point was thanks for the strain

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
name recommendations i do appreciate

234
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,239
that i will post more of that stuff to

235
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,439
social media more to the discord also if

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,038
i do ask for strain name recommendations

237
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,360
and i can find the person who gave me

238
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,519
the name that i use i will probably send

239
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
you a pack of scenes also

240
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,478
i usually don't do this this is

241
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
something i should start doing

242
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,318
i've got a name that was given to me i

243
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,158
posted one cross i said hey i've got

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
this cross it needs a name somebody

245
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,838
shouted out a name i was like oh i'm

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,038
going to save that for another cross i'm

247
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,800
not going to use it on the one they were

248
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,879
talking about but it did get curbed and

249
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,319
shelved and actually i think i put it on

250
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,599
another one already if that is now

251
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,839
another cross i know what it's named

252
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,440
that goes on another pack um you'll get

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
points for that also when i do put that

254
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
cross out i'll try to remember who said

255
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
that if you remember i'll send you a

256
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
pack of those seeds that makes it super

257
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
easy that way people get treated they

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,480
get a prize they get rewarded for their

259
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,759
creative content all right i'm rambling

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
about strain names but that's what's

261
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,039
been on my brain all day i've been

262
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,639
trying to name a few things i got a lot

263
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,399
of great fun stuff coming out make sure

264
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,399
you join the discord that's where they

265
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
see it first all right i did say i was

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
going to read an email about stretchy

267
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
plants i don't want to ramble too long

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,399
maybe too late for that if you notice me

269
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,159
playing with the microphone i did wobble

270
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
here i apologize if i look distracted

271
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,319
might be time to replace this mic or mic

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,559
stand anyway let's get right to this

273
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,519
email here this one came from

274
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,119
our friend it does not have a name on it

275
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
so we're not going to say their name it

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,159
goes a lot like this it says what am i

277
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,399
doing that makes my plants stretch so

278
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,159
much that is a common problem a common

279
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
issue it could be a lot of things we'll

280
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,639
diagnose that here based on the evidence

281
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,720
we are given it see it it says they seem

282
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,958
to grow the most in week three for me

283
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
yeah that is very common um when you put

284
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,119
your plants into flower i call it the 21

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
day stretch the first three weeks

286
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,639
they're really going to take off then

287
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,559
about the start of week four they kind

288
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,000
of calm down and start building buds

289
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,919
they're just trying to develop space

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
they're getting going uh that is a very

291
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,159
common thing but there are things we can

292
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
do to prevent that to minimize that and

293
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,319
to keep you on track from growing those

294
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,360
plants up into the freaking lights it

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
says i start them uh day one at 10 to 12

296
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,159
inches tall and they always end up

297
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,639
around 36 inches or sometimes taller

298
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,159
this week this is week four my photos

299
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,600
were taken today he did include a couple

300
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,879
of photos or they did include a couple

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,720
of photos

302
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,240
it says i kept the 600 watt hps 18

303
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,639
inches from the canopy to try and keep

304
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,959
the plant short but it made the outside

305
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,879
edges stretch worse i think yes by

306
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,319
looking at the photo i would agree that

307
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,240
the plants on the outer edge of this

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
room did stretch worse they did not stay

309
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
compact like you would have hoped uh and

310
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,480
i know why we'll talk about that it says

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,959
it is a seed run that may account for

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,360
for some variation but it's wedding cake

313
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,759
not a tall plant by any means

314
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,120
um so you say right here that you did

315
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,559
raise the light from the canopy uh that

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,159
is why they're stretching that is not

317
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,599
enough light for that amount of space

318
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,480
they would prefer more light if you had

319
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,240
a thousand watt in there or maybe even a

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
an led light with the appropriate

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,879
spectrum they would not stretch as much

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,879
so a lot of the issue is light they want

323
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,399
more light i see that you have got the

324
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,159
kind of light that has got the wing that

325
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,639
you can bend and flex you've got it bent

326
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,559
down to create a very tight arc from

327
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,240
that shield that is a reflector is what

328
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,759
that piece is called

329
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
the umbrella piece that is making the

330
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,679
light stay inside of that reflector and

331
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
reflect around if you can bend that out

332
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,879
more and spread that out to get the

333
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,879
light you'll watch it happen as if as

334
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,639
you lift the sides of those wings up the

335
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,320
light will come out to the side more and

336
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,759
those plants on the side will receive

337
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
more light that will be the first thing

338
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,000
i would do then i would lower that light

339
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,759
i would start with lowering it about six

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
inches and if it didn't do anything good

341
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,120
i'd go about six more i'd watch until

342
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,200
those plants start to look like they're

343
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,519
almost mad then i'd go up a little bit

344
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,360
but i drop it down six inches right away

345
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,959
so spread that wing a little bit drop

346
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
the plants down six inches now you're

347
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,078
gonna spread that light more and you're

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,159
gonna penetrate a little more deeper

349
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,519
into that canopy the main problem is

350
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,120
those lights those plants are not

351
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,399
getting enough light that is the main

352
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,519
issue about those plants that i can see

353
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,958
um

354
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
now basically plants are going to

355
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,319
stretch that is what's going to happen

356
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
you can minimize that by giving them

357
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
more light you can minimize that by

358
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
using a trellis net to hold them down

359
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,319
pull them down you can use a tomato cage

360
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,439
you could pull them into the tomato cage

361
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
and spread them underneath there and

362
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
then when they grow up you pull them

363
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
under the next level of the tomato cage

364
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
kind of weave them in

365
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,679
you could drill holes in the top of your

366
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,278
buckets and you could put a

367
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,638
string on the branch and you can pull it

368
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,480
down and then tie it to the bottom of

369
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,759
the bucket i've seen that done

370
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,240
now people are making 3d printed plant

371
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,240
light stress or low stress technique

372
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,600
clips so you basically pop the plant a

373
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,278
little bit and put this clip on it and

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
it will hold the plant at a 90 degree or

375
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,120
a 45 degree they sell a couple different

376
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,639
styles it'll just bend that plant right

377
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
over for you the plant will start to

378
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,919
grow horizontal over a couple of days

379
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
it'll go straight back up then you grab

380
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,879
it a little further down and do it again

381
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
you can manipulate the plants to keep

382
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,720
them low that is something that you'll

383
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,879
have to learn to do as a gardener once

384
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
you find the phenotype which you want to

385
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,799
work with that's another thing that i do

386
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,559
want to talk about here in this room uh

387
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,799
we'll get to that another thing we could

388
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,719
do we can pop and twist these plants a

389
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,399
little bit something i really like to do

390
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,240
as soon as i put the plants in flower

391
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
day one i move them to the flower room

392
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
clean up the legs do a lollipop do a

393
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,679
little defoliation do a little uh

394
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,278
shaving the legs some popping and

395
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,439
twisting is the next thing i do i talk

396
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,439
about this a lot i simply grab the plant

397
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
with two hands and i twist different

398
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
directions to where you achieve like a

399
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,240
knuckle popping sound i'll do it

400
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,599
i don't have any knuckles to pop i'm

401
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
there we go you'll get that sort of a

402
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
sound when the plants make that sort of

403
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,399
sound you have now broken the cellulose

404
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,078
fiber of that plant

405
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
don't bend it sideways don't bend it

406
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,599
over just twist it and you'll pop it now

407
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
what's going to happen is that plant is

408
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
going to spend a lot of its energy

409
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,639
refocusing on that little popped and

410
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,319
twisted part it's going to heal that

411
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
it's going to make a knuckle

412
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,160
a knurled spot if you will that little

413
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,559
section will be stronger than it ever

414
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
was before also it's going to support

415
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,759
the buds better than it would have

416
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
without that but also what you're doing

417
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,519
you're slowing down the stretch because

418
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,278
now the plan is spending energy

419
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,480
repairing all of those pops and twists

420
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,919
because i'm going to do it i'm going to

421
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
start at the main stock i'm going to go

422
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,879
all the way up the main stock then i'm

423
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
going to go each branch all the way up

424
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,600
and pop and twist as much as i possibly

425
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
can and cause a lot of it's low stress

426
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
training to this plant just by popping

427
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,198
and twisting it now it's going to spend

428
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
a lot of energy repairing and recouping

429
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,799
all the damage that we just did instead

430
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,319
of growing tall it's going to just go i

431
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,399
can't grow tall i got to fix all my

432
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
broken arms and my broken knuckles we

433
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
didn't do a lot of serious damage to the

434
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,399
plant but we did enough to refocus the

435
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
energy on repairing instead of growing

436
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,799
tall now we're not going to damage any

437
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,559
buds any weed any flower development

438
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,639
because that's not even happening yet

439
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,239
the plants are still transitioning into

440
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,159
their flowering hormones that's why

441
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,759
they're starting to take off so rapidly

442
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,519
there are nutrients we can feed our

443
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,600
plants which will mitigate that stretch

444
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,679
maybe if you reduce the nitrogen that

445
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,680
will slow down that stretch i like to

446
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,439
give my plants shine right at the start

447
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,958
of flower and i notice that that does

448
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
reduce the stretch a little bit there

449
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,838
are a lot of products out there that

450
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,360
will claim to reduce stretch

451
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,519
do some reading do some research but

452
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,720
the main thing i would think about is

453
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,720
this is plant and phenotype specific

454
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
this is your first run with these plants

455
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,040
these came from seed

456
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,560
i would have flowered these much sooner

457
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,838
i've seen your grow space and it is a

458
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,119
little packed in there the plants are a

459
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,079
little stretched out they're a little

460
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
tall

461
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,319
and we don't even know if we've got

462
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,879
males or females or intersex plants or

463
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
mutants or keepers at this point

464
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,039
and you've been vegging for

465
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
at least 30 probably 45 days based on

466
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,399
the photos that i've seen

467
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,599
so you're already 45 days into these

468
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,879
plants and we don't know if they're

469
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
going to be keepers we don't know if

470
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,799
they're total trash or if they're gold

471
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,240
they could be either or you said you

472
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,319
have got some i think you said wedding

473
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
cake that could turn out to be a hundred

474
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
percent intersex plants or that could

475
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,479
turn out to be hot hot fire i'm not sure

476
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,159
what you've got either are you we don't

477
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,920
know until you flour them out finish

478
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,958
them dry them cure them smoke them and

479
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,559
approve them or reject them so what i

480
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,799
would have done is i would have grown

481
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,359
these much much smaller and then

482
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,120
flowered them much earlier my plants

483
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,278
would have been about the size of your

484
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,839
plants when they are finished my test

485
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,000
run of plants would be as big as yours

486
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,759
are now when they are done i would be

487
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
done already those would have been into

488
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
flower i would have sex them i would

489
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,039
have pulled out the males i would have

490
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,399
had them finished already we'd be drying

491
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,000
curing them and smoking them while

492
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,639
you're still vegging not really you're

493
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
only like 45 days in but i'd already be

494
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,320
a few days into flower with plants that

495
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,278
are brand new i wouldn't spend that much

496
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
time

497
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,759
lights energy electricity water soil

498
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,360
nutrient space i wouldn't have given

499
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
them all of that without knowing if they

500
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
were keeper plants so

501
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,799
one of the things i would have done

502
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,399
i would have put those plants into small

503
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,240
pots i would have grown them out until

504
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,839
they were six or eight inches tall then

505
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,519
i would have put them into flower until

506
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
i can identify the males and females i

507
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,399
would have pulled the males out of the

508
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,000
room immediately then you have a

509
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,078
decision to make do you want to re-veg

510
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,919
or do you want to cut clones i would get

511
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,599
a clone or i would dedicate to re-veging

512
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,439
at this time right now i'm limited on

513
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,519
numbers i would go with the re-veg

514
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
situation so we just move forward you

515
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,078
can either

516
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
keep flowering these plants or you can

517
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,918
veg them until they get a little bit

518
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
bigger and then flower them out but once

519
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,280
those boys are out of the room at this

520
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
point i would probably just keep

521
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,678
flowering keep flowering them out then

522
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
find the good females out of that batch

523
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,959
there's going to be a shitty one there's

524
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,240
going to be an amazing one there's going

525
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,919
to be one that tastes good there's going

526
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,599
to be one that harvest heavy you've got

527
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
to find the plant out of that batch that

528
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,599
works best for you do you want that tall

529
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,519
stretchy phenotype do you want that

530
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,119
short squat phenotype do you want the

531
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,319
one that makes the super dense buds and

532
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,759
tastes real good do you want the one

533
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,519
that makes a little fluffier buds but

534
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,440
gets you super high there's going to be

535
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,038
different phenotypes to select for in

536
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,080
there and i would have done the phenol

537
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,359
hunt before i did the big dedicated grow

538
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,119
which is kind of what it looks like you

539
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,879
did then we could have found out does

540
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,798
this one get tall does it get stretchy

541
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
what does it do then you can dial in

542
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,319
your environment for the specific plant

543
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
right now you got a big jungle uh some

544
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,240
plants are 18 inches tall some are 36

545
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,279
inches tall by the time you get midway

546
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
through flowers some are going to be

547
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,000
touching the light you're going to have

548
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,679
to get some and bend them down you're

549
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,599
going to have a lot of work to do so in

550
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
the future i would recommend flowering

551
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,159
smaller test plants don't waste a lot of

552
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,000
time space energy money and investment

553
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,720
on something you don't know is going to

554
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,319
pay off the return on investment is very

555
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
important especially nowadays the

556
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,639
cannabis is losing value electricity is

557
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,880
going up everything costs more we've got

558
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
to pay more attention to the return on

559
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
investment so i think the thing to take

560
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
away from this piece is to set yourself

561
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,038
up for success before you fill that room

562
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,639
or even your outdoor this does apply to

563
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,119
outdoors i've done a full episode on

564
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,559
this on outdoor growing before you fill

565
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,000
your room with giant plants and grow

566
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,918
them real big and give them a lot of

567
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,759
time and love let's find out are they

568
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,200
males are they females are they intersex

569
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,038
are they mutants or do you have the

570
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,960
plant that you want to work with let's

571
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,960
do a proper phenol hunt let's find the

572
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,440
plants we need then let's repeatedly

573
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
grow those let's be real careful this

574
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,798
year not to put

575
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,319
male plants outdoors and ruin other

576
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,639
people's gardens let's be real careful

577
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,720
not to put intersex plants outdoors this

578
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
year and ruin other people's gardens

579
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
let's be more selective let's be more

580
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
careful let's put plants outdoors that

581
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
we're going to enjoy smoking all season

582
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,759
because if you do it right you're going

583
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,199
to grow a bunch of it let's not put some

584
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,960
b-grade [ __ ] out there that somebody

585
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
else selected that they didn't really

586
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,079
want that they gave to you because it

587
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,519
was extras in their grow let's put some

588
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,678
good [ __ ] out there let's be more

589
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,400
selective let's pay attention set

590
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,798
yourself up for success if you have the

591
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
option to run that seat indoors and find

592
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,480
if it's a male or a female find the

593
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,160
keepers find the best plants that is the

594
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
ideal way to do it the first time you

595
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,440
run these plants is just the first day

596
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
don't expect uh the amazing outcome from

597
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
the first eight that's not going to be a

598
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,319
cash crop that's not going to be a

599
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,000
profitable crop you can definitely

600
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,918
you'll have medicine you'll have product

601
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
from that first run but this is your

602
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,480
inaugural test crop this is how a farmer

603
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
finds the plant that works for them the

604
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
first one is an audition the casting

605
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,759
couch this is tinder this is your

606
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,440
swiping right now you got to go on that

607
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,919
first date you got to find the one you

608
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,840
like then pamper that one once you find

609
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
the one that works best for you all

610
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,599
right i think i've made my point on that

611
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,038
part um don't put some random seed or

612
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
clone outdoors it could be a male it

613
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,158
could be trash don't waste your time

614
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,918
don't ruin yours or your neighbor's

615
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
garden my friend that sent me this

616
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,840
message i hope i did help answer some of

617
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,678
your questions i would spread that wing

618
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,279
up i would lower the light then i would

619
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
probably start popping and twisting and

620
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,960
bending those plants down now because in

621
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,439
the future they are definitely going to

622
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,038
get way out of control um if you're

623
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
looking for the keeper out of that pack

624
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,640
i don't know that this run was an

625
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
official solid test run because some of

626
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
those plants are super stretchy because

627
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
of their location in the room

628
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,319
next time maybe rotate the plants around

629
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,679
a little bit so that you get some on the

630
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,519
edge some in the middle and then just

631
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
move them just do like a rotation so

632
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,960
they all get a little bit of that prime

633
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,559
light and then they all spin a day in

634
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,919
the week light just move them around

635
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,639
that way you don't get super stretchy

636
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,480
super squat plants all in the same room

637
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
my dude thank you for the great question

638
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679

big shout out to my buddy seth the

651
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,080
question goes a lot like this it says

live batter from some friends in uh we

658
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
can't even talk about where they are

659
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
because

660
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
then you guys will bother them and they

661
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,559

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,480
some machine

667
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,919
checking on me it says at one point in

668
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,000
my life i was a high school biology

669
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
teacher and while while teaching things

670
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
like mandalay and genetics and plant

671
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,558
biology i was i would always try to tell

672
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,038
my students pay attention now because

673
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,879
it's free if you wait till later in life

674
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,480
someone will make you pay for this type

675
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,919
of information

676
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,159
most of the time that is true but it

677
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,320
goes on it says thank you for proving me

678
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,000
wrong i love how you are providing all

679
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,918
of this free knowledge so that we can

680
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
all learn from our hearts i appreciate

681
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
that thank you for noticing i do try to

682
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,159
keep the show free of course there is

683
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,759
the patreon it's where if people do want

684
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,679
to contribute they can so i do

685
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,200
appreciate you noticing but i do put all

686
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,440
of this content out here without

687
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,038
charging you a penny for it all right it

688
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,558
does go on it says i have a grow

689
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,440
question which is great because that's

690
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,918
what i am here for it says i currently

691
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,159
grow organically in soil with an hlg

692
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,240
600r spec and then it talks about the

693
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,400
grow a little bit it says i'm finishing

694
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,640
a run of strawberry glue from th seeds

695
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,640
which is a 7 to eight week flowering

696
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,799
strain that i had planned on taking out

697
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,600
the full eight weeks which would mean

698
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,440
harvest is in two days all right it goes

699
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,678
on it says i heard on your podcast that

700
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,240
for the last seven to ten days you

701
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,120
switch back to an 18 6 light cycle and

702
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,319
i've decided to give that a try yes many

703
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,399
people have said that i'm completely

704
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,399
crazy for doing so but the people have

705
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,038
that have tried this have given me great

706
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,200
praise when i am finishing my plants

707
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,000
when i'm flushing i turn my lights back

708
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,480
to 18 hours on and six hours off yes

709
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
that is uh not normally what people do

710
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
but i get great results i notice my

711
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,319
plants get beefier and chunkier and they

712
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,240
finish a little more quickly so that is

713
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,279
something i've implemented it into my

714
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,120
grow i do not do this on the very first

715
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,279
run i do this after i know the plants

716
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,879
after i know how long they flower how

717
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,798
long i need to flush them when they are

718
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,039
done that is when i start doing cool

719
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,839
fancy [ __ ] to them not on the first run

720
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,558
keep that in mind so let's keep going

721
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,158
there's more it says uh the problem is

722
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,240
that in two days i don't think the

723
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,600
trichomes will be ready i thought they

724
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,120
would have been ready but this morning

725
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,240
they're probably only two to five

726
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,479
percent amber and mostly cloudy but some

727
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,319
trichomes are even still clear that is

728
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,079
uh they will speed up quite quickly

729
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,798
they'll never be completely even

730
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,879
completely the same it says i feel i

731
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,200
definitely have to take the 18 6 light

732
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,000
cycle out to the full 10 days which

733
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,759
would be a tuesday harvest date my

734
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,679
concern all right this is where we get

735
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,839
to the concerns is that what if the

736
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,919
trichomes are not ready on tuesday which

737
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,798
would be the full 10 days of switching

738
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,679
back to the 18 6. i think you'll be just

739
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,400
fine going 14 full days with 6 light

740
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,400
cycle maybe even up to 17 days i've gone

741
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
and have not had problems

742
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,919
this is why i always say this is why i

743
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,480
say two things

744
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,240
ah always go always plan to go longer on

745
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
your inaugural run with the pack of

746
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,079
seeds when you said at the beginning

747
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
that this was supposed to be a 78 week

748
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,038
flowering cycle strain i was already

749
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
skeptical i would already plan to go

750
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,079
nine weeks with that i definitely

751
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,200
wouldn't go eight weeks i would go nine

752
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,399
just to see

753
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,640
then the other thing that i would

754
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,320
definitely not do is do the 18-6 on the

755
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,759
first run so that you don't run into

756
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,960
this type of issue

757
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,879
if you would have ran it and i'm not

758
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
trying to to criticize you or scold you

759
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,919
or anything i'm just saying if we would

760
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,278
have done a run with these plants first

761
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
we would have known they definitely

762
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,480
don't finish in eight weeks then we

763
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,159
would have known not to start the timer

764
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,159
too early so then we would have figured

765
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,600
that out but i don't think you're gonna

766
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,120
have too much of a problem they're going

767
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,719
to finish up on time you've still got a

768
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,278
couple of days to go plus you've got a

769
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,120
couple of added extra days always go

770
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,798
longer in my opinion than the original

771
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,639
breeder's recommended time um go 5 10 a

772
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,000
few extra days just to see what the

773
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,840
plants might do you don't even know what

774
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,679
they would do if you don't go that extra

775
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,879
time and they're not definitely not

776
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
going to be done if you would have done

777
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,200
the light cycle the regular cycle with

778
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
the breeder recommended so your concern

779
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
is that the trichomes are not ready on

780
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
tuesday which would be 10 full days of

781
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,798
switching back to the 18 6 light cycle

782
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,278
if i let the plants go even longer to

783
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,839
get 20 to 30 percent amber trichomes do

784
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,079
i run the risk of re-veging these plants

785
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,879
if i have to go longer than 10 days

786
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,519
18-6 should i switch back to 12-12 no do

787
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,278
not switch back to 12-12 that will freak

788
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,798
them out more than anything you've

789
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,880
already given them a hormone shift in

790
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,720
the i said hormone shift i apologize if

791
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
you caught that both times i said it

792
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,200
you've already confused them that will

793
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,038
just make them even more confused

794
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
they'll start doing wonky [ __ ] leave it

795
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,839
on the 18-6

796
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,360
let them finish out if you see any signs

797
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,639
of revenge you'll know what it looks

798
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,319
like at the tips of the buds they'll

799
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,120
start doing weird [ __ ] cut it down right

800
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,119
then begin flushing now be prepared to

801
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,639
cut right away but i think your plants

802
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,399
are going to finish up on time in the

803
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,000
next few days you'll notice that over

804
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,919
the next few days they'll just finish up

805
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,278
for you they're done and they're on that

806
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,038
light cycle that makes them go more

807
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,839
quickly they will finish up if you've

808
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,440
got to cut down before they are 20 to 30

809
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,240
amber that will not be a big deal you

810
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,600
will still have quality potent smoke i

811
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,480
don't think it's going to ruin the crop

812
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,558
for you so pay attention uh see if they

813
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
start looking like they're re-vegging as

814
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,158
soon as you see reveg cut them also pay

815
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,120
attention to the trichomes i would go

816
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,039
about 15 to 20 amber then i would cut at

817
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,359
that point but i do not think you should

818
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,960
switch back to the 12 12. now there is a

819
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,519
second half to this question it does go

820
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,600
on it says my next question is about

821
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,519
breeding these are my favorite questions

822
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,918
it says i'm about to become an amateur

823
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,839
pollen chucker and i just germinated

824
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,919
four of your firefly seeds with the

825
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,599
paper towel method for the record i

826
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,440
tried to germinate six and all six

827
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,439
showed a taproot coming out and i

828
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,000
planted them uh it talks about that and

829
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,278
then uh 100 germination rate it looks

830
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,599
like a couple of diet and i'm not sure

831
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,200
why we don't cover that i says my plan

832
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,798
is to get a cutting of another strain

833
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,798
from a friend and cross it with the

834
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,038
firefly with the dual goals of making

835
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,278
firefly a little bit shorter and to

836
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,720
really push the skunk nodes i know that

837
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,558
you always seem to give permission to

838
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
breed with your gear but i at least

839
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,240
wanted to ask permission and show you

840
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,440
respect you deserve not to mention i

841
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,038
wanted to make sure that you did not

842
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,880
have any plans to do the same cross

843
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,398
being that you are a professional and

844
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
this is your business and i'm doing it

845
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:40,959
for fun

846
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,879
dude

847
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,480
you have got my full blessing everybody

848
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,080
out there if you're listening or

849
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,319
watching or if somebody's reading this

850
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,879
to you or whatever you've got my full

851
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,639
permission to breed with my seeds and my

852
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,000
strains i did not invent cannabis i

853
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
don't own weed

854
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,599
i don't have a copyright on seed

855
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,759
breeding that is not me that's not my

856
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,359
way i make seeds just like all the other

857
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,079
breeders make seeds just like you're

858
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,839
gonna make seeds i didn't

859
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,599
sneeze some seeds out of my ass one day

860
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,678
and create a strain i had to get seeds

861
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,119
from other breeders you see me honor the

862
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,798
breeders that i work with that's all

863
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,959
that i ask you to do when you do breed

864
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,960
with my stuff if you post a picture say

865
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,798
this was whatever across the roster

866
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,480
jeff's firefly or firefly cross to

867
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,240
whatever give me some credit i would

868
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,839
love that that's all you've got to do

869

873
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,918
breeding um find the plants that work

874
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
best for you grow them a couple of times

875
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,679
uh understand why i have a good goal it

876
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,119
seems like you do and then do your

877
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,679
breeding bro grow from your heart breed

878

with love and show me pictures of the

879
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
results it says if this email makes it

880
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,359
to the show please don't read this

881
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,038
sentence all right

882
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,038
um no i don't plan on working with the

883
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,960
cross that you're working with and i uh

884
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,558
i'm not even a fan of that plant no

885
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,079
offense to it that's just not my thing

886
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,038
so you're gonna do something totally

887
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,359
different than what i would do enjoy

888
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,200
then it says finally do you have an

889
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,038
application to become a seed tester i

890
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,600
could not find one on the website i'm

891
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,278
not an expert grower but i am not a noob

892
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,959
either obviously any seeds that you sent

893
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,798
me would automatically refrain from

894
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,720
doing any pollen chucking

895
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,480
or anything else for that matter other

896
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,880
than testing them i do appreciate that

897
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,720
thank you there is not an official

898
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,200
tester application i have put out an

899
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,519
episode about testing seeds i basically

900
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,038
ask you to watch that episode send me an

901
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,558
email then if you want to be a tester

902
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,879
you will be required to join the new

903
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,359
discord server and post all of your test

904
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,440
photos on the new discord server in the

905
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,278
tester section that is what i would like

906
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,440
if you're qualified and able to do that

907
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,119
send me a message maybe send me a few

908
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
pictures of your grow just say hey these

909
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,479

910
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,240
what i can do uh let me know that you're

911
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,159
uh detail oriented let me know your

912
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,319
skill level and then i will consider you

913
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,399
as a tester so send me that email

914
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,158
i will do my best to get test seeds out

915
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,319
and i do appreciate that you know better

916
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
than to breed with my test seeds that is

917
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,519
always frowned upon in the tester

918
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,798
community i don't know that those seeds

919
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,879
are any good i don't know the future of

920
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,398
my new cross i hate it when people breed

921
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
with [ __ ] that i send them as testers

922
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,319
that's not cool let me do what i'm gonna

923
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,919
do with it before other people get out

924
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,918
there and do their thing with it uh

925
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,440

926
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,960
anyway um

927
