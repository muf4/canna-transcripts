00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,488
in this episode I'm going to read a few

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,379
more listener emails let's not waste a

20
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,899
lot of time let's jump right into this

21
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,718
first email this first message goes like

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,450
this hello Jeff first off thank you so

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,010
much for all of your work on the podcast

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,868
especially with the grow lessons because

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,659
they have for the most part gone hand in

26
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,219
hand with my very first room and that

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,049
puts a smile on my face every time I

28
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,150
hear it it feels like my grow lessons

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,700
were perfectly timed up with a lot of

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,290
people's very first grow and that puts a

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,359
smile on my face I'm glad I was able to

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,909
help so many people out I hope I made

33
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,129
your grow experience Oz less stressful I

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,079
hope I made it more fun and overall more

35
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,879
enjoyable so man I'm glad I was able to

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,219
help you out with that now the message

37
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,618
goes on to say I am using cocoa for my

38
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,810
medium along with success nutrients

39
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,640
success has recommended that I add their

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,670
product called sugar all the way through

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,978
the final flush my question is is it

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,409
necessary to do so during the final

43
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,030
flush because I've heard conflicting

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,359
views on it from those I get information

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,579
from locally one person even stated that

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,530
cocoa needs something in the water for

47
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,959
the plant to grab ahold of in order to

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,968
drink properly thank you again for your

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,129
time and I'll for sure give my mom a hug

50
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,500
for you since she is in town on her

51
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,269
vacation hey bro I hope you and your mom

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,789
had a great time during her vacation

53
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,730
let's talk a little bit about success

54
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,699
nutrients and flushing with

55
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:18,649
Cocco now I generally don't find it

56
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,658
necessary to use any nutrients or

57
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,489
products during the flush phase our goal

58
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:23,989
is to clean out the medium so the plants

59
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,340
will stop eating so that we can clean

60
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,530
them up so that when we dry and cure

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,598
them the buds taste delicious and they

62
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,310
burn nice and smoothly now there has

63
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,169
been a lot of controversy or a lot of

64
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,209
conversation around the subject of

65
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,889
flushing is it necessary does it do

66
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,689
anything are we wasting our time could

67
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,699
we be improving our plants a little by

68
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,829
feeding longer I'm learning a lot there

69
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,479
is still a lot of debate going on once I

70
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,640
have made a decision on how I feel I

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,399
will share more information with you on

72
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,589
the show for this podcast let's talk

73
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,989
about the standard 2-week flush phase

74
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,939
that most growers are familiar with like

75
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,370
I said a moment ago I generally don't

76
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,930
find it necessary to add any nutrients

77
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,420
during the flush phase unless you've had

78
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,519
problems during the grow or unless you

79
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,530
know you were feeding excessively I

80
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,450
really push my plants to the limits

81
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,519
sometimes during the flush phase I'll

82
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,649
use an enzyme just to help clean up that

83
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,289
soil but most of the time I'm just

84
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,569
adding water just clean water sometimes

85
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:19,400
i pH sometimes I don't that will be a

86
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:21,379
part of the conversation I have in the

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,329
future when I talk about my new ideas

88
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,098
about flushing again I'm still learning

89
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,439
I don't want to teach anything until I

90
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:29,629
have a solid grasp on my new learnings

91
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,189
so when we're flushing we're trying to

92
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,930
clean out the medium we don't want the

93
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,090
plants to eat anything that is our main

94
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,950
goal we want to starve them just before

95
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,379
harvest now the product that was

96
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:41,238
recommended is called sugar which in my

97
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:43,189
mind automatically led me to believe

98
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,259
that this was some sort of a sweetener

99
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,000
product which I could understand why a

100
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,729
company would recommend a sweetener

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,439
product toward the end of flour but I

102
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,629
did some research I went to the success

103
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,939
nutrients website and I did research on

104
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,878
their product called sugar and sugar is

105
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:01,878
actually not sugars sugar is actually

106
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,858
high in sulfur and magnesium now if you

107
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,120
understand plant biology you understand

108
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,620
why these elements are good for the

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,259
plants and why they may be recommended

110
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,530
ly in flower but they are not necessary

111
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:14,929
at this stage of the game I don't find

112
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,238
it necessary to feed high amounts of

113
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,910
sulfur and magnesium this lay in flour

114
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,668
but it won't be detrimental it wouldn't

115
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,439
cause a problem if you did unless you're

116
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:26,299
really overdosing these products I don't

117
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,430
think you're going to notice it in the

118
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,100
flavour of the fine

119
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,990
product it may increase trichomes it may

120
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,199
increase resin production it may

121
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,660
increase that final bulk but also it may

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,030
not do much at all this could be just

123
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,189
simply a sales tactic for a nutrient

124
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,228
company to sell you a little bit more of

125
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:46,360
a product I did not look at the price of

126
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:48,038
this product by the description by the

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,759
look of the website I assume this is a

128
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:54,219
pretty pricey product so is it necessary

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,139
no it is not necessary to add anything

130
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,720
to your flush when you were flushing

131
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,848
your plants for the last week 10 days 2

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,250
weeks however you decide to do it it is

133
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,199
not necessary to add any product to the

134
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,779
flush and Coco you can flush with just

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,240
plain water and it is optional if you

136
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:12,369
even pH that water during your flush

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,340
phase now if you have already purchased

138
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,810
this product called sugar and you've got

139
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:18,638
more than one plant and you're not

140
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,038
running a hydro system if you were able

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,500
to feed your plants different nutrient

142
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,779
regimens here is a suggestion to have a

143
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,410
little fun with this product and this

144
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:31,359
product line what I would recommend is

145
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,099
select one plant or maybe select half of

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,780
your plants choose however many you want

147
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,189
this is your grow you need to do this

148
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:38,859
experiment to where it works best for

149
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:41,860
you but select at least one plant and

150
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,509
feed it the recommended amount of this

151
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,460
product all the way through the flush

152
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,589
phase write it on that plant I am

153
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,000
feeding this plant sugar all the way

154
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,609
through write it down

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,529
mark that plant then take another plant

156
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,300
and don't feed it sugar through the

157
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,038
flush phase and mark it this one did not

158
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,569
get fed sugar through the flush phase

159
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,009
make sure they're clearly marked and

160
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,569
don't [ __ ] it up during the last two

161
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,120
weeks of bloom they'll feed one the

162
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,918
wrong mix so feed the one sugar for the

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,069
last two weeks don't feed the one sugar

164
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,658
for the last two weeks cut them down

165
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,430
make sure that tag stays with them so

166
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:13,959
you know which is which make that tag

167
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,939
stay with them all the way up until the

168
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,310
moment you smoke them so you want to cut

169
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,319
them down dry them yoram trim them out

170
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,060
the way you normally do treat them just

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,038
like you normally would both of them

172
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,870
need to be treated exactly the same if

173
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,959
you want this experiment to be valid at

174
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,269
all so don't feed the product to one B

175
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,829
the product to another harvest them the

176
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,990
way you normally do process them than

177
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:37,329
what you normally do then consume them

178
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,310
the way you normally do and take note do

179
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:41,019
you notice any difference some things

180
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,240
you may want to compare are Harv

181
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,889
wait does the one you fed the sugar is

182
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,879
it a little heavier toward the end

183
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,590
because you've been giving it more

184
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,509
product maybe it packed on a little bit

185
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,948
more weight you're paying for something

186
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,900
in that bottle they say that there is

187
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,250
sulfur and magnesium in there so that's

188
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,138
sulfur and magnesium better be

189
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,720
converting to something tangible

190
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,009
something quantifiable on that plant

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,960
something you should be able to see or

192
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:04,000
measure in some sort of way because that

193
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,500
product is costing you money so is it

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,870
doing something in the end that's what

195
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,449
we want to see do you have more harvest

196
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,978
weight or do you have more trichome

197
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,680
density that is something we could all

198
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:16,930
desire is more trichome density did you

199
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,478
get frosty or buds by using the product

200
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,069
for the last two weeks a flower maybe

201
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,079
something else to pay attention to is

202
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,729
how does it look visually did your

203
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,680
plants burn did they start to look like

204
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,228
[ __ ] did they look really healthy all

205
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,430
the way through did they show you any

206
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,598
visible differences that's something

207
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,180
that you can pay attention to as a

208
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,009
grower something you can learn from the

209
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,348
next test we get to do is the best test

210
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,939
it is the smoke test you have properly

211
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,250
dried and cured and processed your

212
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:44,500
product you handled both batches exactly

213
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,449
the same now let's roll one up or let's

214
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,250
pack up a bowl however you do it again

215
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,169
please don't put this sample batch and a

216
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,819
blunt wrap you can't get a scientific

217
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,620
result from smoking it out of a toilet

218
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,569
paper tube it's not gonna work for you

219
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,668
let's use something glass or a thin

220
00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:00,218
paper let's be scientific about it

221
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:02,318
anyway let's roll one up let's pack up a

222
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:04,360
bowl and see how it burns that one that

223
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,189
you fed for the extra two weeks does it

224
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,199
burn funky does it taste different as

225
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,848
the ash chunky is it gross to you does

226
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,129
it burn your throat is it burn your lips

227
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:14,348
does the high give you a headache is it

228
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,060
different in any way is that product

229
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,978
that you flushed for two weeks is it

230
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,478
nice and smooth does it make you choke

231
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:21,430
does it make you cough is the hai

232
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,278
different than the other one in any way

233
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,098
compare the two maybe smoke one the

234
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:28,870
first smoke today try one of them then

235
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:30,339
your first smoke tomorrow try one of

236
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,078
them and then just alternate for a

237
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,578
couple of days maybe stick with one for

238
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,588
a whole day stick with another one for a

239
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:38,078
whole day so you can actually get a real

240
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,270
result from your product that's the only

241
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:41,799
way you can tell if they are just trying

242
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,569
to sell you something so that you spend

243
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,458
more money or if it is actually going to

244
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,950
make a difference in your grow in your

245
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,539
environment in your situation so the

246
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,028
short answer is no it is not necessary

247
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:53,559
to apply that product late in Flour but

248
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,580
the fun answer is since you've already

249
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,528
got it let's

250
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,089
to some plants and not others let's do a

251
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,649
little bit of an experiment and let's

252
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,839
find out for ourselves what we're

253
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,458
getting out of this product and honestly

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,019
that's really the only fair way to judge

255
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,518
a product you can't judge it just by

256
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,200
reading a label you can't judge it by

257
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,299
what you hear this is the best way to

258
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,550
make a real decision a real judgment on

259
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,500
any product is to experiment with it do

260
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:16,088
a controlled experiment and find out for

261
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,610
yourself what you think about that

262
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,350
product in your grow some things that

263
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,028
work for your bros aren't gonna work for

264
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,430
you and some things that work for you

265
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,379
aren't going to work for your bros very

266
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:28,958
small differences in a grow environment

267
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,328
will make large differences in the final

268
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,979
outcome every little spoke will make a

269
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:35,139
difference in the way that wheel rolls

270
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,000
in the final product so again the only

271
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,100
way you can give a fair assessment a

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,620
fair judgment is to run the trial on

273
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,230
your own as for the person who said that

274
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,970
Coco needs something in the water for

275
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,009
the plant to grab ahold of the water to

276
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,528
drink properly I would like to know more

277
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,659
information about what they are saying

278
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:54,338
there because when there are roots

279
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,838
exposed to water and the plant is

280
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,810
thirsty it will drink

281
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,839
I have flushed countless plants in cocoa

282
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,909
in large facilities without anything in

283
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,040
the water and they flushed just fine

284
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:07,958
I've got great lab results the product

285
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,208
tastes great I've got huge harvest

286
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,109
weights and everybody is satisfied with

287
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,149
the final product

288
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,730
and again there was just water in that

289
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,110
final flush for 10 days so to wrap that

290
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,850
one up I encourage you to run the

291
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,190
experiment and when you do I look

292
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,290
forward to the report from the results

293
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,730
of that experiment all right I want to

294
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,009
thank you for the great email I'm going

295
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,539
to move right into the next message this

296
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,838
one's a little shorter and it goes like

297
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,179
this

298
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,890
hello sir how formal of you thank you

299
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,838
for the great reading it says first and

300
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,338
foremost dude we went from Sirte dude

301
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,440
really quickly here this just got

302
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,940
comfortable thank you very much for the

303
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,320
knowledge you share dude you were very

304
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,459
welcome thank you for the hilarious

305
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,528
email I'm having fun with this one

306
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,939
already he goes on to say I can't begin

307
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,850
to tell you the difference and before I

308
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,050
started listening and after that means a

309
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,850
lot that you're learning stuff from me

310
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,099
it makes it worth my time and energy so

311
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,720
thank you for that now the question is I

312
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,339
also wanted to ask you a question do you

313
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,269
put your plants into a dark period

314
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:03,130
before harvest and if so how long so

315
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,860
this question is asking if I give my

316
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:08,470
plants a dark period before harvest it

317
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,810
is not uncommon for a lot of growers to

318
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,629
leave their plants in the dark for 24 or

319
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:15,609
maybe 48 or I've even heard 72 hours in

320
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,549
the dark before harvesting their plants

321
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,009
in a small personal grow environment yes

322
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:23,189
I do practice the dark cycle before

323
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:25,629
harvest this has several benefits

324
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,550
unfortunately it is not feasible in many

325
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,289
commercial environments in a lot of

326
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:31,959
commercial environments I've got a very

327
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,969
large room with multiple lights in there

328
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,220
sometimes a hundred lights in one room

329
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,379
sometimes 200 lights in one room there's

330
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,600
one building we work in that has 500

331
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,769
lights in one room and instead of having

332
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,990
separate sections

333
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,659
we just load tables with plants one

334
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,370
table every two weeks gets cycled out so

335
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,259
there is not the opportunity to change

336
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,450
the lights in that room because we've

337
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,909
got more plants in there that rely on

338
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,500
the schedule so we can't manipulate the

339
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:58,719
light cycle in some of the larger

340
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,600
facilities but like I said in a small

341
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,110
personal grow yes I do implement the

342
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,750
dark cycle before harvest this has many

343
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,340
benefits first it's great for your

344
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,440
electrical bill you're saving

345
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,360
electricity that's a whole day you're

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,640
not running the gear that's 12 hours at

347
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,830
least of electricity you're not paying

348
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,539
for that's also 12 hours on your bulb

349
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,610
that your bulb is going to live it's

350
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:24,069
also 12 hours on your ballast that your

351
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,019
ballast will live it's possibly also 12

352
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,990
more hours on a couple of blowers and

353
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,819
air conditioners now I know that just

354
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,680
sounds like 12 hours of electricity but

355
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,560
over a year or two and in a couple of

356
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,919
rooms with multiple lights at 12 hours

357
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,859
over 2 or 3 days will add up in today's

358
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:45,549
cannabis market black market or legal

359
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,870
prices are dropping so every dollar will

360
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,179
count at this point

361
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,789
so our first advantage is we are saving

362
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:53,739
electricity now let's talk about the

363
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:55,599
plants while they are in the dark the

364
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,220
plants are just swelling up a little bit

365
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,960
the plants are just grow and they grow

366
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,910
in the dark and they absorb light energy

367
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,259
during the day they suck in all that

368
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,610
light during the day and when they go to

369
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,840
sleep that's when they grow they're just

370
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,970
like a little kid they grow in their

371
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,250
sleep so we're gonna give them a nice

372
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,810
long nap so that they can bulk out and

373
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,539
they can grow a little bit in their

374
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,279
sleep also the trichomes kind of seemed

375
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,289
to mature a little bit in that dark

376
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,819
period so I think they'll ripen up a

377
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:21,069
little bit more if we leave them in that

378
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,120
dark period they also feel like they get

379
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,300
a little more

380
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,938
in that final dark period now I should

381
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:30,849
add that sometimes that is

382
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:33,818
strain-specific more tropical skinny

383
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,430
leaf sativa cultivars may not enjoy that

384
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:38,289
dark period as much as your chunky thick

385
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,870
indica dominant white leaf type

386
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:43,480
varietals so if you do choose to stick

387
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,870
some plants in the dark for a 24 36 48

388
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,730
72 hour period I suggest you check on

389
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,100
them don't be afraid just to open the

390
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,569
door long enough to inspect your plants

391
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,399
give them a look if you've got a scope

392
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:55,838
go check out the trichomes you might

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,129
want to give them a little squeeze see

394
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,389
how they feel on density you don't go

395
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,680
touching them all over is that's just

396
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,509
gonna ruin the point we want to get the

397
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,039
trichomes nice and mature don't go

398
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,600
rupture the trichomes with your fingers

399
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,308
don't go steal all the essential oils

400
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,019
with your fingers just touch them in one

401
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:10,480
spot give them a squeeze see how they

402
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,220
feel give them a visual look are they

403
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,019
getting funky from being in the dark too

404
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,699
long did you water them and then move

405
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,990
them to the dark and close them up in a

406
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:19,269
room that doesn't have enough airflow

407
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,759
and now you've got mildew happening pay

408
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,528
attention to stuff like that smell your

409
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,300
fingers after you squeeze the buds see

410
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:28,178
if it still smells good is the smell

411
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,588
getting better or worse are you happy

412
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:31,360
with what is happening while those

413
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,040
plants are left in the dark if you're

414
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,899
happy with what's happening leave them

415
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,578
in there also keep it kind of cool in

416
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,188
that dark room because that's going to

417
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:41,229
lead to my next part another big

418
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:43,688
advantage to keeping our plants in the

419
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,289
dark for several hours before harvest is

420
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:50,078
the light degrades terpenes light and

421
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,490
heat starts cooking off our terpenes so

422
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,708
if we've got them in the dark in the

423
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,289
cool we can develop more turps in our

424
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:58,748
plants right before harvest the dark and

425
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,730
the cool are best for trichomes and

426
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:02,558
terpenes and that's what we are after we

427
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,120
want essential oils we want those

428
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:06,519
terpenes we want the best quality

429
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,620
product we can get and the dark is the

430
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,230
best environment for that preservation

431
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,659
the dark cool environment is the best

432
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,778
warm and moist starts ruining our

433
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:19,958
product so yes the short answer is yes I

434
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:22,328
do like a dark period before harvest the

435
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,789
how long kind of depends on how much

436
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:26,828
space I've got do I have a space I can

437
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:29,409
utilize for this dark period do I have

438
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:31,688
more plants coming along also what type

439
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,909
of plant am i growing some of this is

440
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:36,069
going to be a trial and error sort of a

441
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:39,279
thing like I said earlier

442
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,200
weiter leaf more beefy chunky more dense

443
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,360
indica varieties are gonna like this a

444
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,970
little bit more the tropical sativas may

445
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,710
not respond as well to this what I would

446
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,149
suggest is you take the strain you were

447
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,150
working with and if you've got multiple

448
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,069
plants put one in the dark for 24 hours

449
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,899
get another one put it in the dark for

450
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,270
48 hours get another one

451
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,199
put it in the dark for 72 hours I guess

452
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,789
you're gonna have to do that backwards

453
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,280
because the longer one's got to go in

454
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:04,779
first but you get my point put three

455
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,329
plants in the dark four different

456
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,649
intervals and see if there are any

457
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,259
noticeable differences in your final

458
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,090
product you may see differences did the

459
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:14,740
trichomes develop a little more density

460
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,139
on that one you left in the dark longer

461
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,570
did one get more dense then one smell

462
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:21,639
better did one start to get funky did

463
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,980
one just start to die did one degrade

464
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,269
too quickly in the dark pay attention to

465
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,830
the plants pay attention to the

466
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:29,169
trichomes pay attention to the leaves

467
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,450
again give them a squeeze smell your

468
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,849
fingers smell the buds up close use a

469
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,009
scope if you've got one do a little

470
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,379
personal science experiment to find out

471
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:40,539
what works best for you and your

472
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:42,100
specific cultivar I would like to be

473
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:44,289
able to give you more guidance on things

474
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,930
like this but sometimes a lot of times

475
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:49,179
these things are very plant specific

476
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:51,459
very strange specific very cultivar

477
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,319
specific and a lot of times so it's hard

478
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,210
to tell you exactly what to do because

479
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,950
I'm not sure where your plant is from

480
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,900
I'm not sure how your plant is going to

481
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,450
react there are a lot of variables that

482
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,220
could happen in the grow so to wrap that

483
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,709
one up yes I do like a dark period

484
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,660
somewhere between 24 and 72 hours

485
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,019
depending on the availability of space

486
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,660
also plant dependent strain dependent

487
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:15,250
another thing to think about is

488
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,570
environment in your darkroom if you're

489
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,609
just throwing those plants in a closet

490
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,588
like some people do you need some sort

491
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,479
of airflow in there imagine you just

492
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,980
watered your plants you lock them in a

493
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,449
closet you close the door all that

494
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,279
humidity and moisture has to go

495
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,410
somewhere you've got big fat chunky buds

496
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,839
in there you're going to create mold on

497
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,850
your finished buds it's the last 48

498
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,039
hours and you just ruined it have some

499
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:38,679
airflow in there don't set yourself up

500
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,019
for failure at the end of the grow and

501
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,570
another thing to keep in mind is these

502
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:46,210
plants are going to be stinky at this

503
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:49,269
point in time wherever you trap them for

504
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,490
this 24 48 or 72 hour dark period

505
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:54,460
when you open it up it is going to be

506
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,069
pungent maybe be prepared for some type

507
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,350
of odor control maybe don't do this on a

508
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:00,700
time when you're expecting company maybe

509
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,069
if you live really close to your

510
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,920
neighbors have some sort of odor control

511
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:07,809
odor prevention in place before this

512
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,450
harvest time comes

513
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,519
harvest is the stinkiest part of the

514
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,799
entire grow process and it is about to

515
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,559
start when you put these plants into the

516
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,539
dark phase alright so that is my rant on

517
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,579
putting plants into the dark before

518
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,829
harvest I want to thank you again for

519
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:25,899
the great email now let's move on to one

520
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:28,599
more email before we start wrapping up

521
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,090
this podcast this email goes like this

522
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,039
hey Jeff my name is and I'm gonna skip

523
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,349
his name but then it continues I'm from

524
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,839
Albuquerque New Mexico and I follow your

525
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:40,299
podcast and Instagram I've been growing

526
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,369
with my ppl now for about two and a half

527
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,230
years and that's a personal production

528
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,059
license if I remember correctly down

529
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,710
there in New Mexico you have to get a

530
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,809
personal production license you have to

531
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,160
get allowed by your landlord are there a

532
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,169
lot of steps to be able to have a home

533
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,400
grow in New Mexico so big shout out to

534
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,140
this guy for making the steps and

535
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,820
getting it done he continues to say

536
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,290
you're doing an awesome job with your

537
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,819
podcast hey thank you a lot bro that

538
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,589
means a lot to me he says I like

539
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:04,089
listening in the morning before work and

540
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:06,490
on the way to work with very good

541
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:08,470
information I still have some Rafael

542
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,960
seeds I need to pop I have a question

543
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,819
about vegging my plants what is too long

544
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,309
to veg your plants is eight to nine

545
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:18,009
weeks too long to veg I'm trying to get

546
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:19,779
my plants a big for a nice yield I know

547
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,119
the older the plants get the more prone

548
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:24,069
they are to pests and diseases my veg

549
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,079
tent is pretty small about four feet

550
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:28,359
tall and my flower tent is about six

551
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,299
feet tall thank you in advance and keep

552
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,619
rocking the podcasts they do thanks for

553
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,450
all the great compliments in there and

554
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:37,809
thanks for listening to the show let's

555
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,789
talk a little bit about veg times you

556
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,919
can veg your plants as long as you want

557
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:43,389
as long as works for you you did say in

558
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,610
the message that you know older plants

559
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,110
get more prone to pests and diseases you

560
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,299
know as long as you take care of the

561
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:51,609
plants they aren't very prone to pests

562
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,919
or diseases a lot of the new strains are

563
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,479
bred with resistant genetics so

564
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,190
hopefully you've got some stuff that's

565
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,049
been bred by a reputable breeder that

566
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,019
isn't really prone to getting pests and

567
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:03,190
diseases the reason we talk about

568
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,869
vegging quickly and flowering

569
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,019
early to get away from the pests and

570
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:09,729
diseases is because people simply bring

571
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,619
problems to the grow it's not that the

572
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,240
plants themselves are prone to getting a

573
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:15,129
disease it's that we just want to

574
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,160
minimize the time for a new grower

575
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,350
having a garden to minimize the risk of

576
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,660
any trouble if it's law enforcement if

577
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:24,429
it's past if it's a plant disease we

578
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,440
want the quickness just to prevent a

579
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,509
problem because the grower usually

580
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,340
brings the problems himself now I'm

581
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,109
going to give you some respect as a

582
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,879
grower and say that you were on top of

583
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:35,679
your integrated pest management system

584
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,870
and you will not be bringing pests and

585
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,759
pathogens into your grow so you should

586
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:42,309
be able to veg your plants as long as

587
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:45,460
you need to without any problems now you

588
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,409
do go on to say that your veg space is 4

589
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,960
feet tall and your flower tent is about

590
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,550
6 feet tall keep in mind that when you

591
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,220
put your plants in to flower they do

592
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,769
have the potential to double in size you

593
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,920
said you wanted to veg are you asked if

594
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,720
8 or 9 weeks was too long to veg you

595
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,850
were probably going to have quite tall

596
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,269
plants by the end of eight weeks of veg

597
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:09,639
that's about 60 days I generally veg a

598
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:11,440
smaller plant in a tent for about 30

599
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,009
days before I put it into flour

600
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,690
maybe maybe 45 days at the most because

601
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,670
they tend to get a little tall in the

602
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,080
grow tents especially if you need to

603
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,490
leave room for the light I'm not sure

604
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,470
what type of light you're running but we

605
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,849
do need a gap between the light and the

606
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,620
tops of the buds because we don't want

607
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:28,179
to burn them and that optimal white

608
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,000
space is just a little distance away

609
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,009
from the actual bulbs so keep that in

610
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,619
mind when you were vegging now if you're

611
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:39,069
going outdoors you can veg those plants

612
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:41,409
as big as you want or need them to be it

613
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:44,710
is not uncommon for people to start

614
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:47,320
cracking seeds in January or December or

615
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,789
even earlier than that for a California

616
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,769
outdoor style grow you'll crack your

617
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:52,659
seeds around Thanksgiving you'll run a

618
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,460
little crop from those seeds find your

619
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,470
females out of there then you will take

620
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,329
clones of those good females and you'll

621
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,279
start vegging them in January

622
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:02,259
you'll veg them all through February

623
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,180
edge them through March under lights

624
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,549
indoors under a thousand watt lights

625
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,220
indoors so we're getting giant beefy

626
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:11,049
plants veg them through April top them a

627
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,089
bunch of times then in May and

628
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,279
California the end of May you can put

629
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,879
them outdoors and they get gigantic

630
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,888
that's how you see those big

631
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,590
and 20-foot tall cannabis plants as they

632
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:23,778
were veg indoors for several months

633
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:25,490
before they were put outside so in

634
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:27,859
theory as long as you are not restricted

635
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,630
by space you can veg those plants to be

636
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:31,579
monsters if you've got a big enough pot

637
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,230
to sustain your root ball if you're able

638
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:35,359
to have enough ceiling space if you're

639
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,490
outdoors you can veg those plants

640
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,528
unlimited as long as you are able to

641
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,808
sustain their root ball and the plant

642
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:44,000
health in an indoor environment you're

643
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:45,408
basically limited by light height or

644
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,109
ceiling height or whatever type of

645
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,639
height or width or size restrictions

646
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:51,168
you've got indoors you can veg a plant

647
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:53,869
if you've got a trellis you could

648
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:55,519
probably fill a 25 by 25 room with one

649
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,048
plant if you were a super patient I

650
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,730
wouldn't recommend it but it is a

651
00:22:57,048 --> 00:23:01,099
possibility it's something you could do

652
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,500
if you wanted to do so I think you could

653
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,240
veg infinitely if you can maintain the

654
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,190
root ball and if you can keep the plant

655
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,558
healthy and if you can keep the bugs and

656
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,240
problems away like I said earlier we are

657
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,369
the ones that bring the problems most of

658
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,589
the time so in theory you should be able

659
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,898
to veg a cannabis plant infinitely if

660
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:20,509
you have got the proper ceiling and

661
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,949
light and light height eventually the

662
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:23,750
plants will get so tall that if you were

663
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,669
in an indoor environment you won't be

664
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,798
able to get any light penetration but

665
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,090
outdoors the Sun penetrates all the way

666
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:30,710
through you get a lot of light

667
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,839
penetration from the Sun but

668
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,370
unfortunately with the Sun we do run out

669
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:36,888
of season so the plants will go into

670
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:39,918
flower once the Sun tells them that it

671
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:42,589
is time so that is my long rant about

672
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,480
veg x just make sure that when you've

673
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,369
add your plants indoors for your tent

674
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,750
that you don't go too long because you

675
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:50,359
don't want to grow up into the lights

676
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,000
again keep in mind that some cultivars

677
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,859
will double in height by the time they

678
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,929
are done flowering so if you were doing

679
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:59,359
a phenol hunt I recommend flowering

680
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,129
early for your first run just to find

681
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,558
out if you've got a phenotype that gets

682
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:05,959
ridiculously tall I just did a phenol

683
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,759
hunt and I found one plant it grew twice

684
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,440
as tall as all of the other plants

685
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,240
within the first 30 days I had to move

686
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,190
it to a different room most of the

687
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,620
plants are up to my knee this plant goes

688
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,450
up to my mid chest it is in the same

689
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:19,008
environment same condition I don't know

690
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,509
what went on with this thing it may not

691
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,509
even get to finish because it is going

692
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:25,250
out of control but for that first run I

693
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:26,929
recommend flowering a little bit early

694
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,730
to find out what you've got know what to

695
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,259
expect and then in your subsequent runs

696
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,058
you can adjust accordingly

697
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,769
you can set your veg time you will be

698
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:35,058
able to dial in your veg time perfectly

699
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,319
you'll know that when they're this tall

700
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,389
I need to flower because they're gonna

701
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,250
finish at this height once you develop a

702
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,730
relationship with that specific cultivar

703
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,140
you'll know exactly how long to veg

704
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,640
