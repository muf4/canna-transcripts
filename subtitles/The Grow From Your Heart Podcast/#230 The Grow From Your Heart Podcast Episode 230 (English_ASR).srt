00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,618
a new application called periscope

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,899

48
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:51,219
if I've got five live viewers I'm

49
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,629
recording they can hear everything I'm

50
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,709
saying they could not hear the pod card

51
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,989
the theme song but they could hear

52
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:58,000
everything else they're able to send

53
00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:00,219
comments that I can see on the bottom of

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,629
the screen I'm not gonna pay attention

55
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,399
to the comments on periscope while I

56
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:06,060
record the podcast today but if this

57
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,500
goes well in a future episode

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,199
this may open up the doors for a

59
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,879
questions and answer segment you'll be

60
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,259

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,389
them live on periscope

62
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,939
as I record the podcast and then in the

63
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,139
future it won't be any more than I'll do

64
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,359
it I'll try to get it up as quickly as

65
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,889
possible right after the live Q&amp;A I'll

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,180
go ahead and throw the podcast up into

67
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,000
iTunes and stitcher and then you guys

68
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,989

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,098

70

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,990
show moving dude a couple of nights ago

113
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,379
my good buddy client got me a ticket

114
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,820
I drove we took along Clint's a little

115
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,530
brother Chris and then we met up with

116
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,969
our good buddy Joe who will be on a

117
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,280
future episode of the podcast we've

118
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,680
talked about that but we went up to

119
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,219
Denver to comedy works and we saw Joey

120
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,980
Coco Diez and that [ __ ] blew the

121
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:13,599
roof off of Comedy Works that dude

122
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,250
ripped it up that's one of the best

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,620
comedy shows I've seen in quite a while

124
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,500
I know I say that about every comedy

125
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,850
show when I come on this show but it was

126
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,240
one of the best shows I've seen in quite

127
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,890
a long time it totally kicked ass for

128
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,199
the first six or seven minutes of the

129
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,209
show he came out and he told the joke

130
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,399
right and he kept telling jokes but he

131
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,019
told it was like he hit me and then I'd

132
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,159
start laughing and as soon as I felt

133
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,719
like I was gonna catch my breath he'd

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,580
hit me harder so I'd laugh even harder

135
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,320
and lose my breath and every time I feel

136
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,199
like I was coming around he'd hit me and

137
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,939
I was starting to get a pleasant to pain

138
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,949
in my cheeks and stomach from laughing

139
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,930
so hard and then I got this weird

140
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,819
headache toward the back of my head from

141
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,560
laughing so [ __ ] hard I was like Joey

142
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,779
stop for a minute bro I need a little

143
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,970
bit of oxygen because I cannot breathe

144
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,709
and I cannot keep up with this I'm

145
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,790
moving the periscope camera right now so

146
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,019
they can see me a little bit better I

147
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,720
think I've got everything I need on the

148
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:09,459
screen so Joey Coco Diaz is definitely

149
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,870
one of my favorite comedians Joe Rogan

150
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,529
says he's the best comedian on the

151
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,629
planet right now

152
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:15,219
I could almost agree with that if you're

153
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,439
into that style I can listen to Joey

154
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,490
talk all day I listen to his podcast the

155
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,120
Church of what's happening now it's

156
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,060
[ __ ]

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,220
so Big Shot at the Joey Coco Diez for

158
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,530

159
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,020

160
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:31,359

204
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,418
podcast he said he was gonna check it

205
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:02,918

206
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:05,250
after we spoke bro so I hope you were

207

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,089
we're gonna keep the show moving we are

209
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,129
going to get on to the main topic of the

210
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:13,629
show the main topic of the show you guys

211
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,740
is going to be Fino hunting and

212
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,449
selecting mother plants

213
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,220
I didn't take a lot of notes because I

214
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,439
feel like I can pull that episode off

215
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,789
without a lot of preparation I mean I've

216
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,160
got all the preparation in my head I've

217
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:27,978
done this a thousand times so I think I

218
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,030
can pull it off but let's see I got one

219
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:31,038
or two more things I want to talk about

220
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,019

221
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,110

00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:39,339
really really cool so a very long time

223
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,340
ago I was scrolling through Instagram

224
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,550
drink caffeine and throat goes to [ __ ]

225
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,129
scrolling through Instagram and he came

226
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,800
across an Instagram page of a lovely

227
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,509
lady called dude it's damsel and I've

228
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,949
been following damsel she's a suicide

229
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,150
girl she's tattooed up she's got

230
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,610
dreadlocks and she's [ __ ] beautiful

231
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,348
she's an amazing woman I've been

232
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,120
following damsel on Instagram for quite

233
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:03,949
a while and then a good friend of mine

234
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,889
our friend hunt the grimy Gatsby

235
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,720
introduced me to damsel and also my

236
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,668
friend Julia I got to give shots to

237
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,220
Julie what's up Jules Missy boo

238
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:15,609
she is partly responsible for

239
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,169
introducing me to damsel so I introduced

240
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,879
the damsel we've talked we've spoken a

241
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:24,468
few times and I am proud to announce

242
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:26,870
that I am working on a strain for dude

243
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:29,718
its damsel The Suicide Girl it will be a

244
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,389
strain specifically selected for her and

245
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,360
the screen will represent damsel it will

246
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:37,370
be colorful it will be sexy it will

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,320
stand out from the crowd it will be

248
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,750
something you want to look at it will

249
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,300
smell beautiful and will taste amazing

250
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,179
and her idea is that when she smokes it

251
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:49,849
she wants a nice giggly sativa head high

252
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:52,129
so I'm working on that strain I've got

253
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,690
several the seeds are ready here's

254
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:57,588
here's where I am the seeds are ready

255
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:00,440
and I have several crosses that I think

256
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,120
would make damsel happy but instead of

257
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,040
just running one cross I'm going to run

258
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,009
three or four crosses that I've made and

259
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,899
we're going to see if one of those gives

260
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:10,049
us a phenotype that dandle completely

261
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,558
loves

262
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:16,318
so that is a great segue to get into the

263
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:18,328
main meat of this podcast the main topic

264
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:20,308
of this podcast is Fino hunting and

265
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:22,438
selecting a mother plant for the future

266
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,789
we're definitely gonna focus on Fino

267
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:28,498
hunting cuz I've already gone about ten

268
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:30,058

291
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,548

00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,579
and Angela has picked her favorite

293
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:28,740
phenotypes or phenotype the strain

294
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:31,588
should be available for purchase in

295
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,720
flower format green and healthy cannabis

296
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,089
and Colorado Springs and also the spot

297
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,678
dispensary in Pueblo West Colorado so

298
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,369
that'll be a long time coming but once

299
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:42,419
it's available we will let you guys know

300
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:44,490
so to get that far

301
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,678
I'm going to have to do a phyno hunt

302
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,990
which is actually the main topic of this

303
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:50,188
show

304
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,558
feels like a good place to start would

305
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:54,958
be to define the word phenotype so I'm

306
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:58,980
headed over to Google and Wikipedia says

307
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,778
a phenotype is the set of observable

308
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,730
characteristics of an individual

309
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,850
resulting from the interaction of its

310
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,528
genotype with the environment so kind of

311
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,418
what that says is if we have a bunch of

312
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:11,188
seeds and we grow them out and they are

313
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,749
all the same genotype which means they

314
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:15,599
came from the same parents the same

315
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,399
batch of seeds if we grow those out we

316
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,040
will see what is called Fino typical

317
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,480
expressions which means some of those

318
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,799
plants are going to show characteristics

319
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,420
of its mother

320
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,789
some are going to show characteristics

321
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:29,219
of its father some are going to show

322
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:31,078
characteristics of grandparents that we

323
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,329
didn't even see in the parent plants and

324
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,789
then some of them are going to show

325
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:37,438
perfect traits of fifty-fifty

326
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,688
combinations of each and then you're

327
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:41,399
gonna see variations in between

328
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:43,678
depending on which finial generation

329
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,078
you're working with so one way to kind

330
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:47,970
of put that is if you have a brother or

331
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,758
a sister you probably don't look exactly

332
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,629
alike because you're from the same

333
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:57,659
parents but you are different phenotypes

334
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,860
basically maybe maybe your brother is a

335
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,178
little taller than you or a little

336
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,188
fatter than you or something that's just

337
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:04,558
FINA caffeine Oh typical expression of

338
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,969
the same genotype basically so when

339
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,769
we're working with plants when we're

340
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,980
looking for phenotypes the purpose of a

341
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:13,438
Fino hunt is to find the plant that you

342
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,600
want from that 10 pack of seeds now you

343
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:18,149
have a couple of decisions to make do

344
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,189
you want um do you want the plant that

345
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,688
represents the one that's on the picture

346
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:23,428
of the package of seeds the one that you

347
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:25,259
read about do you want the one that

348
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:26,610
grows a little bit shorter for your grow

349
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,199
room do you want the one that's a little

350
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,999
more indica dominant the one that's a

351
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,558
little more sativa dominant that's

352
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,778
something to think about when you are

353
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:36,749
starting a Fino huh the purpose of the

354
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:38,308
phenol huh is to run through see I would

355
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:40,319
recommend at least ten seeds as a

356
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:43,499
breeder I do anywhere from 25 to a

357
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:45,688
hundred seeds of the same strain so the

358
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:48,298
ideal thing is to run as many of these

359
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:50,698
seeds seedlings as you can underneath

360
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:53,009
the same conditions to find the one that

361
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:54,539
you want that is the stellar keeper out

362
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:56,579
of all of the plants that you're working

363
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,578
with a lot of times I see people

364
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,828
purchase a package of seeds and they

365
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,719
will run two of those seeds and then

366
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:06,479
they'll say hey look I've got Sour

367
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,048
Diesel or hey look I've got super Lemon

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,639
Haze and you might have a decent super

369
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,168
Lemon Haze but you don't have that super

370
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,459
phenotype because you haven't gone

371
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,379
through and done the work you haven't

372
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,508
female hunted out the one that is

373
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,428
stellar that is worth keeping that's

374
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,438
gonna blow everybody else's mind so a

375
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:24,480
phenyl hunt is where you're gonna find a

376
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:26,129
lot of good [ __ ] and you could have

377
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,720
gotten that Stiller keeper out of just a

378
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,489
couple but I mean if you do a large

379
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,470
phenol hunt the chances of finding what

380
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:33,019
you want and that still are keeper just

381
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,790
it's even better

382
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,559
all right so let's talk about a couple

383
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,870
of really popular phenotypes while we're

384
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,059
on this subject before we get into me

385
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,549
explaining how I do my fee no typical

386
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,859
fee no hunts I'm sure you guys have

387
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:48,199
heard me talk about Jillybean there is a

388
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,940
really popular phenotype of Jillybean

389
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,830
known as the candy store phenotype

390
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,090
there's also another phenotype known as

391
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,580
the orange phenotype the candy store

392
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,810
phenotype smells like when you walk into

393
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,710
the candy store in the mall it's got

394
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:02,809
that sweet

395
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,519
it's like those candy hearts you buy at

396
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,769
Holloway at Valentines Day it all smells

397
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,720
real sugary and sweet animation by quani

398
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,100
candy that's what the candy store

399
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,509
phenotype smells like that's of course

400
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,700
why it's called candy store the orange

401
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,500
phenotype smells like a basket of

402
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,690
[ __ ] oranges it's so delicious and

403
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,429
those are known phenotypes so when you

404
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,200
hear people talking about yeah I got the

405
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,569
orange phenotype or I got the Julie Fino

406
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,220
that's what they're talking about I

407
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,400
breed a stream called heart of gold and

408
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,620
there is the chunky girl phenotype which

409
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,179
just grows big fat fee nose and then

410
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,759
there's the mean girl which looks a

411
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,409
little she's real jagged and the way

412
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,450
that her buds drove a real spiky and

413
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,579
pointy so I call her the mean girl just

414
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,050
cuz she looks angry when she grows it's

415
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,670
a really great plant but it looks like

416
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,859
ferocious it's like an intimidating

417
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:48,379
plant for some reason and then there's

418
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,820
also the the other Fino which is the non

419
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,470
desirable Fino it's the one that's more

420
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,030
golden goat leaning I don't keep that

421
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,200
fee no when I grow heart of gold I'll

422
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,209
toss that one out right away when I

423
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,700
identify it but that's more of an

424
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,139
advanced thing so when you hear us

425
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,790
talking about like I've gotten though

426
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,259
whatever fee no that's what we're saying

427
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:06,199
that we drew out a pack of seeds that we

428
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,059
found the pheno that was known that's

429
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,040
been talked about a lot or that the

430
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,929
breeder told you to look for like I know

431
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:15,049
that there are fee knows of black cherry

432
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,639
Kim that I told guys my friends I'm like

433
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,839
if you see that I wouldn't even keep

434
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,699
that one I'd just get rid of that right

435
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,840
away they're like if you see this that's

436
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,730
kind of the one you want to keep so if

437
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,860
your girl black cherry Kim the one that

438
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,139
shows dark dark purple right away like a

439
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,060
plum purple right away I don't think

440
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:31,669
that's a keeper it grows little tiny

441
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,829
popcorn balls of bright dark dark purple

442
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,269
buds and I don't find that to be a

443
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,620
keeper so as a female hunter I know to

444
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,970
throw that away and I only know that

445
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,889
because I've grown it out so many times

446
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,330
I feel like I'm drifting a little bit

447
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:43,309
away from the topic but it's all useful

448
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,200
information here all right I should

449
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,679
probably get into explaining a little

450
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,660
bit how I do

451
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,028
fino hunt or how I would recommend you

452
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,620
doing a Fino hunt as a kind of a new

453
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:55,649
grower without a lot of space and a lot

454
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,049
of money to spend on seeds um so the way

455
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,789
to do it I would get a ten pack of seeds

456
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:01,259
or a twelve pack if you can get at some

457
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:02,819
some folks are still in twelves get

458
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,049
about ten seeds if you can tens enough

459
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,600
you know if you want to run a Fino hunt

460
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:08,639
for yourself ten is enough seeds I would

461
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,250
get seeds from a reputable company from

462
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,159
a reputable vendor I would recommend

463
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,730
stuff like gage Green Genetics La Plata

464
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,139
labs I read genetics of course Sin City

465
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,620
seeds has shown me some great [ __ ]

466
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,379
lately

467
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,940
the sour seed company has a great lineup

468
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,769
and a lot of great things to offer there

469
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,180
are a lot of great DNA genetics is

470
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,799
somebody who I would recommend rare

471
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,919
dankness as somebody who I would

472
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,969
recommend Crockett family farms there

473
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,289
are a lot of seed breeders out there you

474
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,899
guys try to do some research get a

475
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,399
reputable brand give yourself a chance

476
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,950
get some good seeds and give yourself a

477
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,929
chance so get a good ten pack of seeds

478
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,240
feminized or regulars that's up to you

479
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:48,509
so what we're gonna do we're going to

480
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,250
germinate all ten seeds and we're going

481
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,230
to treat them all the same we're going

482
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,600
to do everything exactly the same to all

483
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,420
ten of these seeds for almost all of

484
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,850
their lives until kind of mid flower if

485
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,799
we see that they need more water or more

486
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,899
nitrogen or more something in late

487
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,209
flower we'll make a note of that and

488
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,009
then we will keep that in mind when we

489
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,110
select our keepers in the future so

490
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,730
we're gonna germinate ten seeds we're

491
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,129
gonna get we're gonna pay attention to

492
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,449
them from day one because you just want

493
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,089
to keep notes if you've got a seed

494
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,529
that's a straggler make a note of one

495
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:22,859
that's a straggler if you can label your

496
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,338
seed somehow like seed 1 C 2 C 3 make a

497
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,289
note of that

498
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:27,240
so germinate these seeds get them into

499
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,849
cups Grom take some pictures if you can

500
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,440
about once a week if you can then what

501
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,269
we want to do is pay attention to them

502
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,160
really closely veg them out a little bit

503
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,240
then you want to take a clone of them as

504
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,519
soon as they're big enough to take

505
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,319
clones so now you've got these little

506
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,509
plants that are probably in like 1 to 3

507
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,710
gallon pots and you've probably taken a

508
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:46,379
couple of clones off of them hopefully

509
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,620
right so now you've got a decision to

510
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,750
make

511
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,639
do you want to flour out the original

512
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,650
seed that you started or do you want to

513
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,840
keep that seedling as a mother plant or

514
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,030
do you want to keep one of the clones as

515
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,558
a mother and flour out that plant that's

516
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,149
already large

517
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,410
it's kind of a toss-up it depends on how

518
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,410
much space you have in what you want to

519
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,230
do what I have learned is I like that

520
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,960
seeded the seedling mother to stay as my

521
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,120
mom for some reason it has more vigor it

522
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,269
seems to be a good idea to keep that one

523
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,009
as your mother that's just my opinion a

524
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,569
lot of people say that that one's

525
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,509
already grown and already big why not

526
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:23,069
flower it out lately from watching

527
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,660
clones grow and watching seed plants

528
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,279
grow I prefer to have my mother plant

529
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,279
come from seed that's something I have

530
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,808
learned I may be hypocritical because

531
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,668
sometimes time doesn't always allow that

532
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,619
sometimes I need the space in the room

533
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,290
to bloom so I bloom out the large plant

534
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,839
that's already going but from now on I

535
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:43,678
will try to keep that seed plant as my

536
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,879
original mother so you got these plants

537
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,040
that are big enough to take a claw off

538
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
of you take a couple clones and then you

539
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,069
decide which one you want a flower so if

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,440
you're gonna flower that original mom

541
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:54,418
you put all ten of those original seed

542
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,250
bombs into a flowering room and you

543
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,530
treat them all the exact same and you

544
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,970
flower all of them if you choose to do

545
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,649
clones all you have to do is get the

546
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,419
clones into pots get them brewed and

547
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,070
everything get them healthy and then put

548
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,179
those into the flowering that'll catch

549
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:09,178
everything right up we're on the same

550
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,590
lesson now so now you're in flower now's

551
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,900
when you really have to start paying

552
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:14,579
attention and taking good notes if

553
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,950
you've got males you'll find out about

554
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,750
day ten get those out of there unless

555
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,569
you plan on breeding because those males

556
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,859
are going to start dropping pollen it'll

557
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,029
start causing you problems get the meals

558
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,159
out of there about day ten we talked

559
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,928
about that a lot if you're fina hunting

560
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,090
for males that'll be a whole nother

561
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,009
episode you guys you're I'm not even

562
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,209
ready to do that I'll write it down but

563
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,808
I'm not sure that that's gonna happen

564
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,308
for a long time you know hunting males

565
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,750
that's gonna be neat that's a really

566
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:42,029
advanced lesson that'll be way up there

567
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,308
like the way past episode 100 the whole

568
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,139
talk about it maybe so pull out the

569
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,629
males you want to take a lot of notes

570
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,710
because around week three week four is

571
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,190
when you're gonna start seeing a lot of

572
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,900
different [ __ ] if something perms you're

573
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,090
probably gonna see that around between

574
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,259
five and eight get rid of all of those

575
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:01,470
you don't want to keep their

576
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,730
hermaphrodites so if you got a ten pack

577
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,919
you're probably gonna get somewhere

578
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,509
between four and six boys out of there

579
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,860
right if you've got regular seeds so you

580
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,329
pull those out now you got like five

581
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,729
more to deal with if you've got FEM si

582
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:14,349
and probably you lost wondering germ you

583
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,880
only got nine so now you probably got

584
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:18,849
four or five plants to work with maybe

585
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,080
six if you're working with Femmes you

586
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:21,429
may still have ten of them

587
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,960
couple of them are gonna be run to you a

588
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,519
couple and be squatty or whatever it's

589
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,100
okay to pull the squatty plant if

590
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,990
there's shitty if it's healthy and not

591
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:31,119
looking like a run and a problem keep it

592
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,710
because when you run LA Confidential the

593
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,929
shitty looking plant is the one you want

594
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,430
to keep honestly it's the it's not the

595
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,710
run it's not crappy looking it's the

596
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,880
small slow growing one if your plant

597
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,279
looks like a runt you can go ahead get

598
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,140
rid of it so you want to watch them grow

599
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,700
some are gonna do stupid [ __ ]

600
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,770
pay attention to what you like the ones

601
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,450
that fall over a lot if the one if one

602
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,220
attracts bugs or one attracts mold

603
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,049
that's not the keeper

604
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,160
watch for nanners like I said around

605
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,789
week five or eight if you get a

606
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,710
hermaphrodite

607
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,680
get rid of that one so take a lot of

608
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,029
pictures smell em pay a lot attention to

609
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,890
how they grow then you're gonna have to

610
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:04,240
harvest all ten of these plants or

611
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,250
however many made it to the end I said

612
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,880
four to six right so harvest all four to

613
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,890
six of these trim them down cure them

614
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,470
properly listen to episode number 35

615
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,470
about drying and curing dry and cure

616
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,900
your medicine properly once all of your

617
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,759
finished plants are dried and cured it's

618
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,860
time to do a few smoke samples on every

619
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,990
phenotype that you've grown now if

620
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,939
you're growing it for just you you can

621
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,349
smoke it and you can decide which one

622
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
you like for yourself but if you're

623
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:32,409
gonna be selling it or giving it to

624
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,450
medical patients or sharing it with your

625
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,130
friends it's a good idea to pass out a

626
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,799
few buds of each one and I don't tell

627
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,360
anybody which is which I just label it a

628
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,430
or B and I'm like tell me which one you

629
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,109
like better and tell me why and then I

630
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,430
send it off to a couple of my patients

631
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:47,589
my buddy Doug what's up Doug I hope

632
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,320
you're listening every time I grow new

633
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:51,490
plants I don't label them and I remember

634
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,230
what they are I'll give them initials or

635
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,849
a code word or something and I'll take

636
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,990
it - Doug gonna be like smoke these tell

637
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,849
me which ones we need to keep and which

638
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,490
ones we should get rid of and since I'm

639
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:02,319
his medical provider his opinion is a

640
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,730
big influence on what I keep and then

641
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,240
also a white mic that's on the podcast

642
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:10,029
milky trichomes Nemo punk 15 he does a

643
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,839
lot of helping with my selection also if

644
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:15,309
you're the grower it's a lot up to you

645
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,289
50% of it is up to the grow if it grows

646
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,569
like [ __ ] if it grows 12 feet tall in

647
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,799
eight weeks and you're indoors and

648
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,839
you're under an eight-foot ceiling

649
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,960
that's not the phenotype for you you

650
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,579
know if it grows 32

651
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,200
feet wide in six weeks and you're in a

652
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:29,839
small room that's not the phenotype for

653
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,490
you if it grows super completely lanky

654
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,709
and falls over it needs a thousand

655
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,390
steaks and you're trying to get one bud

656
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,670
kind of scrog system that might not be

657
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,320
the one for you so look for the one that

658
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,779
grows the way that you want it to grow

659
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,750
hopefully that comes out to be the one

660
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,789
that smokes well also and typically this

661
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,470
is what I found is a grower drawing a 10

662
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,269
pack you're gonna end up with one that

663
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,920
is [ __ ] beautiful you're gonna end up

664
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,839
with one that is covered and resin and

665
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,190
has a lot of trichomes and then you'll

666
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,289
probably have one that tastes really

667
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,180
really good and he'll have one that

668
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,909
harvests really really heavy but if you

669
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,230
can find one that does all of those then

670
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,060
you're golden that's the one that you

671
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,440
want but if you can get two or three of

672
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,240
those if you can get the good high and

673
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,100
the good flavor that's awesome I would

674
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,870
sacrifice that for weight if you're a

675
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:13,789
cash proper maybe you want to sacrifice

676
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:15,019
the good flavor for the weight you know

677
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,129
just think about what you want if you

678
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,680
can find a strain that does it all for

679
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,440
you find that get clones of it and grow

680
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,180
it forever but a good fee no hunt you

681
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,350
have to take clones cuz if you don't

682
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,940
take clones of everything you grow

683
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,349
you're gonna end up having the best weed

684
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,059
on the planet one time and not have a

685
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,919
clone of it and be so pissed off at

686
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,389
yourself

687
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,490
alright guys that's the basics of a Fino

688
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,920
hunt basically keep in mind that not all

689
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,390
seeds are going to yield the exact same

690
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,490
plants you might not get the plants that

691
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,130
you saw in the package you might not get

692
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,019
the plants that were advertised but your

693
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,720
goal is actually to find the one that

694
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:48,829
you love and keep that one around and

695
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,089
turned it into a mother plant we're

696
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,589
going to talk about that in a second but

697
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:52,789
once you've got that one keeper you know

698
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:55,279
you can do next you got to do another

699
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,779
Fino hunt of ten more seeds and find

700
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,399
another keeper and if it's better than

701
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,899
the other one that you've got then toss

702
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,190
out that other one or do it until your

703
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,320
mother room is full just keep hunting

704
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,610
for keeper plants and more keeper plants

705
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,769
until you've got the most stellar

706
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,969
[ __ ] lineup of plants all right so

707
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,789
let's talk about keeping a mother plant

708
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,380
now you've grown this vino hunt you have

709
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,970
found the plant that you like you've got

710
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,230
the one that has the flavor you like it

711
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,870
gives you the high you like it grows

712
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,460
well for your room now you've got you

713
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:21,079
either took a clone of it or you've got

714
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,090
that remaining seed plant that you're

715
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,409
going to use as a mother so the trick to

716
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,359
keeping that plant is your mother plant

717
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,240
is to keep it under a vegetative light I

718
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,329
like to use a 19-5 cycle for my mother

719
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,009
plants a nineteen on a nineteen hours on

720
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,799
five hours off because I feel like this

721
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,549
gives my plants plenty of light to keep

722
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,980
them from

723
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:42,139
trying to auto flour some more tropical

724
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,870
strains will try to auto flour if you

725
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,390
let them go a little less light so the

726
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:49,449
19 5 5 hours to give them a little bit

727
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,800
of sleep cycle and let my equipment rest

728
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,360
every living thing likes to sleep so I

729
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,339
like to give my mother plants a little

730
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,519
bit of sleep time so you keep your

731
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,869
mother plant on a vegetative cycle a

732
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,629
vegetative light cycle to keep it alive

733
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:05,479
indefinitely anyway I would like to feed

734
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,770
it some sort of like just a basic veg

735
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,750
nutrient whatever you're feeding your

736
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,519
veg plants you can feed your mother

737
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,710
plants that just basic nitrogen keep the

738
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,089
roots happy if you want to keep them for

739
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,799
a long time you're going to have to

740
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:19,819
repot your mothers they will get root

741
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,069
bound so what I do my mother plants only

742
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:24,649
last me about 8 months to a year I'll

743
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:26,058
cut new mother plants okay a clone I'll

744
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,009
cut six or eight clones from my mother

745
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,269
plant right and I will run four or five

746
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:32,119
of those but I'll keep one of them

747
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,289
behind it'll go into a cup it'll go into

748
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,119
a pot and then I'll just put it into

749
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:36,619
that mother room and replace the old

750
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,089
mother plant because they start to get

751
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,669
ran out they start to get kind of lazy

752
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:42,259
and [ __ ] you take a bunch of cuts from 8

753
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,970
8 clones from it it's been sprayed for

754
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,529
bugs it's been manipulated under these

755
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,569
lights for eight months it starts to get

756
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:49,279
kind of kind of lazy so I feel like it's

757
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:51,409
a good idea to take a fresh cut from my

758
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,440
mother plant keep it under that 18

759
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,240
[ __ ] far that 19:5 light indefinitely

760
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,160
and then just keep it alive and then if

761
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,929
you prune it if you keep it free of bugs

762
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,820
if you keep it healthy that mother plant

763
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,290
will stick around and give you lots and

764
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:06,879
lots of clones and keep that strain

765
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:09,799
alive forever so I think that wraps up

766
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,960
fino hunting selecting a keeper and

767
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,940
using that keeper as a mother all within

768
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,500
we got that down here in 25 minutes and

769
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,330
30 seconds so I think that's gonna work

770
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,400
for you guys I really appreciate you

771
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:22,189
listening to the podcast I recorded this

772
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,550
in two sessions on a on a new app called

773
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,740
periscope I do plan on possibly doing a

774
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,659
podcast through periscope I will record

775
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,220
as normal I will also record on

776
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,900
periscope if you're participating on

777
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,029
periscope you will be able to ask me

778
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,530
questions live on the show and I will

779
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,029
answer them for you you'll only be able

780
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,889
to type in the text box but I'll be able

781
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,089
to read them answer the questions I'll

782
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,740
be able to help out the listeners live

783
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:44,869
on the show it'll be a little bit more

784
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,308
interactive we're gonna try it out once

785
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,869
and see how it goes I will try to

786
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:49,700
announce when it's gonna happen so that

787
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:51,199
people can participate and

788
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,819
we can get people on and then we'll try

789
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,319
to do regularly scheduled shows like

790
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,509
that every four or five episodes will be

791
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,189
a question episode a live Q&amp;A is what

792
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:59,119
I'm aiming for so guys I really

793
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,680
appreciate you listening to the show

794
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,599
everybody on periscope watching now

795
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,130
thanks for participating I'm sorry I've

796
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,589
been ignoring the chat on periscope I'm

797
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,720
more focused on the podcast in the

798
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,279
future I will participate with you guys

799
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,529
periscope is a new app you guys check it

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,539
out I login there you turn on the camera

801
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,670
and you talk it turns you into basically

802
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,230
your own reality show you guys can watch

about getting you into

being a cannabis activist or a lobbyist

958
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,799
or just getting your foot into the door

959
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:19,289
to help us support cannabis legalization

960
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,169
it might put together a little spiel on

961
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:24,000
the quick path to step it up and help

962

the following video shows a raid by

991
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,500

995
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,210

996
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,740
also were inserted by the attorneys to

997
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,929
explain what they believe was occurring

998
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,279
after reviewing the photo Santa Anas

999
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,859
police chief says he plans to

1000
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,390
investigate the officer's actions so I'm

1001
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,340
gonna hit play and I may have to adjust

1002
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,929
the volume a couple times oh I still got

1003
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,280
the reggae playing from the intro I'm

1004
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,809
gonna have to adjust the volume cuz it's

1005
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,400
a YouTube video and it gets choppy

1006
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:58,110
alright before you hit play man just a

1007
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,820
little background for the for everybody

1008
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,349
listening so the city in question here

1009
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:08,300
decided that they were gonna ban all

1010
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:11,400
dispensaries a at least for now and

1011
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,800
there were a several that have opened

1012
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,440
had opened up already or opened up in

1013
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,730
the face of the ban and continued to

1014
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,409
operate so I'm not exactly sure what

1015
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,920
steps were taken before the video starts

1016
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:26,190
playing

1017
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,930
city but yeah the videos nuts I'm not

1018
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,608
trying to defend anything in it just to

1019
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:31,558
give you guys a little heads up as to

1020
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:33,119
what led up to the video heading true

1021
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,180
starting all right so I'm gonna hit play

1022
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:42,210
now I apologize if the volume is walking

1023
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:44,909
you guys I'll be on it quickly alright

1024
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:48,960
so what's happening is that's the

1025
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:50,818
battering ram on the front door so talk

1026
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,679
about this they're battering battering

1027
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:54,750
ramming the front door they're busting

1028
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,940
in the front door right there hitting it

1029
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,619
with the battering ram inward it is an

1030
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,750
outward pulling door if the dude would

1031
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,068
have grabbed the handle and pulled right

1032
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,869
it would have opened it was unlocked

1033
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:05,940
there's a business that's open for

1034
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,130
business the view that we're seeing is

1035
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,960
coming from a hidden camera and security

1036
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,309
cameras the law enforcement tore down

1037
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,108
all the cameras during the raid but

1038
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:14,430
there were hidden cameras in here at the

1039
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:15,900
advice of the attorney so if you want a

1040
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:17,129
dispensary put up some hidden cameras so

1041
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,740
that you can catch this [ __ ] if it goes

1042
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,900
on but uh all they had to do was pulled

1043
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,489
that door open and walk in they weren't

1044
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,470
there slamming the door at the battering

1045
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:27,118
ram so all right then they finally

1046
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:39,358
realize oh we can pull they pulled the

1047
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:41,250
door open and they come in carrying

1048
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,848
assault rifles they're all in body armor

1049
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,679
most of them are wearing masks they bust

1050
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,960
opened the door of what would be the bud

1051
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,000
room and the noise is just so noisy in

1052
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,679
here but they start yelling get on the

1053
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,210
[ __ ] ground two people and all these

1054
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,009
people are just customers just shopping

1055
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,690
here and they look a little confused

1056
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,980
like wait we're shopping we're not doing

1057
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,838
anything wrong so I'm gonna play again

1058
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,579
and the volumes the sound is terrible on

1059
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:06,170
this video but it's just a security cam

1060
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,170
footage so that's what we get here we go

1061
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,820
so you here get on the [ __ ] ground

1062
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:13,769
they're telling everybody on the ground

1063
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,780
these cops got guns on everybody cops

1064
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:18,989

1066
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,129
[Music]

1067
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,989
they're telling the employees to turn

1068
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:29,369
off the music turn off that radio

1069
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:32,069
because the music is pretty loud in the

1070
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:35,159
shop I love it that all the giant guy

1071
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:38,960
cops are in masks and there's like a

1072
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:49,679
hundred and sixty pound female officer

1073
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:53,550
what's the mask for fellas but he's seen

1074
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,469
the video enough times a lady out who's

1075
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,300
in a wheelchair who I found out later

1076
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:59,579
after the video was posted she is blind

1077
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,539
she is blind and in a wheelchair and

1078
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:08,009
there was making them fall she has one

1079
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:12,059
leg and yeah she's just at the shop as a

1080
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,200
patient so then it gets worse here's

1081
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,849
what here's what they had to say about

1082
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,079
the lady with the amputated leg here's

1083
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,369
what the cops are saying about it and

1084
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,929
I've got some sound equipment trying to

1085
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,509
process it to make it sound better also

1086
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:26,779
and this is maybe 50 or 60 year old

1087
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,780
woman

1088
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:37,118
so the one cop asked did you punch that

1089
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,099
old benita and the lady cop replied I

1090
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,568
was about to kick her in her [ __ ] nub

1091
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,949
these are the people that we pay to

1092
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,150
protect and serve us these are the

1093
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:44,829
people that think they're doing this as

1094
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,418
serious in the land of the free and the

1095
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,099
home of the brave these are the people

1096
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:50,018
that are serving to protecting the

1097
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:53,919
community and they're talking about did

1098
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:55,298
you punch that old Benita this is like a

1099
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:58,239
six year old woman in a wheelchair with

1100
00:38:55,298 --> 00:39:01,208
one leg handicapped lady yeah why what

1101
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,009
law enforcement action would require you

1102
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,838
to ever physically assault a

1103
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:07,028
six-year-old woman in a wheelchair and

1104
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,159
why would she want to kick her in her

1105
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:10,929
[ __ ] nub that's not any sort of law

1106
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:12,998
enforcement tactic I'm not sure if we

1107
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:14,798
look up any law enforcement manual kick

1108
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,868
her and her [ __ ] nub is not in there

1109
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:19,438
ever no no all right I'm gonna hit play

1110
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:23,318
again we'll find more [ __ ] in this

1111
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:25,239
no it's just it's worse he keeps

1112
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:27,808
repeating it uh no these D playing from

1113
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,809
different angles

1114
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,719
so then the next part is the officer is

1115
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,250
climbing up onto the display cases ona

1116
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,859
first he's trying to pull it down with

1117
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,539
like his crowbar swinging at the cameras

1118
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,750
on the ceiling with a crowbar and stuff

1119
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,610
just smashing security equipment because

1120
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:52,550
they don't want what's about to take

1121
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,530
place to be recorded yeah exactly and

1122
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,240
they didn't realize that they were on a

1123
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,040
hidden camera but just funny this guy

1124
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,259
looked right into it one time I didn't

1125
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,380
realize it was a hidden camera Spencer

1126
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,410
he had two layers of cameras cops

1127
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,940
completely missed layer number two it's

1128
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,589
a nice looking shot too over this place

1129
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,300
well they had several jars it's a well

1130
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,829
setup place they got a nice-looking menu

1131
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,360
it's painted well nice hardwood floors

1132
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:16,099
they were killing it looks like a good

1133
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,570
job the lobby doesn't look totally

1134
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:21,679
different from the one I work in we

1135
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,140

1137
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:27,170
tearing down the cameras it's a seven

1138
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,700
minute video guys and we're probably

1139
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,829

1140
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:32,989
we talk about it now the cops are in the

1141
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:35,630
office is climbing up on top of the

1142
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:36,889
desks and the saves and and now they've

1143
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,240
got bolt cutters so they can cut the

1144
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:40,609
wires on all the [ __ ] and they pull the

1145
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,500
TV down and start cutting wires and then

1146
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,670
watching the monitor to see where the

1147
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,440
cameras are then they're sending the

1148
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,360
dudes to go cut it this dudes in like

1149
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,010
full-on he looks like [ __ ] GI Joe bro

1150
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,880
he's in full-on SWAT gear he's got a

1151
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,980
mask on

1152
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,780
he's got more guns than you need for a

1153
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,130
[ __ ] army these dudes went into a

1154
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,530
dispensary where people were shopping

1155
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,140
and doing business like and raided them

1156
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,550
like [ __ ] SWAT style yeah isn't there

1157
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:05,329
a crack house or somewhere that needed

1158
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,860
to be raided apparently not yeah at this

1159
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,380
point in the video all the furniture has

1160
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,450
been smashed desks are flipped over the

1161
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,250
display cases are all broken open

1162
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:14,929
they're carrying out the DVRs as

1163
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:19,760
evidence so now here's where the video

1164
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:21,859
gets funny guys they think they've

1165
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,350
broken all the cameras and disconnected

1166
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,769
the DVR so they don't think anybody can

1167
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:30,380
see them now so now all the masks come

1168
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:33,079
off yes nobody is masked they are

1169
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,300
opening each jar and smelling the jars

1170
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,799
one of the officers has the buds pressed

1171
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,730
up against his face just like you were I

1172
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,539
would do it and smelling it and then

1173
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,039
I gotta turn it down a little bit and

1174
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:48,139
then one of the offices that's one

1175
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,630

00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:39,259
showed this [ __ ] cop

1197
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,659

1198
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,550

00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:50,629
officers are on duty and they're

1202
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,940
consuming edibles and they're all

1203
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,579

1206
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,809
hanging out throwing darts the guy that

1207
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:05,059

1208
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:08,659
being high right now yet but I don't

1209
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:09,799
know how much time has passed and

1210
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:12,559

1211
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,789

00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:23,119

1216
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,789

their civil rights

1269
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:27,699
I used to run the only dispensary in

1270
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,740
Pueblo it's pretty much my shop for a

1271
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:31,179
little while and then Mike was my backup

1272
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:32,949

1273
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:35,079

1280
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:49,719
come in and close our medical marijuana

1281
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,340

1282
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,649
it was just a regular random police

1283
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,440
officer and then the city manager at the

1284
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,660
time

1285
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,450

1288
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,730

00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:15,380
the letter said we haven't passed

1294
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:18,319
regulations for dispensaries yet you

1295
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,000
have to close and that was the end of it

1296
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,150
nobody wanted to kick any old Bonita

1297
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,190
nope yeah no nothing was smashed they

1298
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,740
don't have to break out the SWAT team

1299
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,869
nobody needed to protect their identity

1300
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:31,429
while they destroyed property in a

1301
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:32,900
random business they didn't need to feel

1302
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:34,909
intimidating they didn't need to waste

1303
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,800
12 officers time they didn't need to

1304
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:38,779
[ __ ] up our days they came in and said

1305
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,760
you guys are fired basically yeah they

1306
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,500
walked in and said you're fired you need

1307
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,780
to find a new job soon is what they all

1308
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,789
walked in and said and that was the end

1309
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,370
of it I mean they didn't grate or smash

1310
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:51,500
or steal anything and yeah there's no

1311
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:53,269
absolutely no need for this on behalf of

1312
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,309
the city and now we've got dispensaries

1313
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,170
10 miles away every direction but not in

1314
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:59,630
our city right pretty stupid

1315
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,039
good move there so Santa Ana what the

1316
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,420
[ __ ] dude I want to see how this turns

1317
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,730
out don't let these cops get away with

1318
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,980
this those guys if you sent them there

1319
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,320
to take down this dispensary because

1320
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,360
cannabis is federally illegal by eating

1321
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:15,200
the evidence there they definitely

1322
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:17,809
committed a huge crime if I if you so

1323
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,049
you caught me destroying evidence on

1324
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:23,659
camera I'd be [ __ ] oh the the part of

1325
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,610
the video that really pissed me off and

1326
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:27,649
I knew I had to share it like everywhere

1327
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,960
I possibly could was right at the end of

1328
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,660
the video the Fire Department shows up

1329
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,210
and one of the cops shouts nice and loud

1330
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:38,239
and clear for the microphones fires here

1331
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,590
everybody watch your mouth it's the

1332
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,959
police department and a fire department

1333
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:44,630
they're essentially the like Batman and

1334
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,210
[ __ ] Robin right why why would the

1335
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,420
fire department seeing and hearing the

1336
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:52,460
police do doing police work or business

1337
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,750
be a bad thing why why would they have

1338
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,429
to watch their mouth around the fire

1339
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,739
department yep what's with that me

1340
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:59,779
there's because you're stealing is it

1341
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:02,089
because you're eating edibles on the job

1342
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,710
you can't drink on the job I'm pretty

1343
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,568
sure you can't consume cannabis on the

1344
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,849
job

1345
00:48:04,568 --> 00:48:08,978
if you're if you're a cop rating a place

1346
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,900
you shouldn't be consuming anything

1347
00:48:08,978 --> 00:48:13,838
there because then you're a Hippocratic

1348
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,489
prick well no it's theft oh yeah but

1349
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:16,838
then you're also a prick like if I push

1350
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:18,548
if I was like Mike you're an [ __ ] cuz

1351
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:20,018

00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,168

1355
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:30,278
they're like oh well I'm gonna take some

1356
00:48:29,168 --> 00:48:32,588
of the products that I just ruined your

1357
00:48:30,278 --> 00:48:35,139
life over right that's such a [ __ ]

1358
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:36,429
piece of [ __ ] person move I mean it

1359
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:38,679
doesn't matter what they're rating they

1360
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:41,168
can't take or eat anything they're yeah

1361
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:44,469
it's I mean no one's been convicted of a

1362
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:46,808
crime like they're just destroying stuff

1363
00:48:44,469 --> 00:48:49,749
for fun they're stealing for fun they're

1364
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:53,410
sitting there eating infused cannabis

dose Chiba juice don't went through the

1370
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,028
[ __ ] streets in full body armor with

1371
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:07,059

1372

please like that's the last thing anyone

1373
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:12,159
needs is a bunch of cops on edibles

1374
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:13,839
that's the truth all right we've got 20

1375
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,150
minutes right now so Mike put together

1376
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,009
some notes I've been asking him to do it

1377
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,889
I want to get more people involved in

1378
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:23,259
cannabis activism this video is a nice

1379
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:25,179
little spark if you're getting involved

1380
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:27,699
and you've kept your head down to this

1381
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:30,548
point I mean this is in California where

1382
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:32,588
weeds basically legal they're arresting

1383
00:49:30,548 --> 00:49:34,088
people threatened any kick an old woman

1384
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:35,858

1385
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:38,708
hustle the [ __ ] up fast enough I mean

1386
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:41,048

1387
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:43,239

1388
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:45,880

really dull a lot of you have a sick

1414
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,990
family member that you need to fight for

1415

1416

00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:04,929
I have people asking me about their pain

1419
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,640
all day or their ailments in what

1420
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:08,679
cannabis might do for them and so

1421
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,838
there's a lot of people out there that

1422
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:13,268
know it's all about a lot more than just

1423
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:15,068
getting I but even if it's just about

1424
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:17,588
getting high for you that's fine

1425
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:21,369
humans have enjoyed intoxicants since

1426
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:23,108
before we had like a society I mean even

1427
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,818
little kids been around in circles to

1428
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:26,500
break free of reality for a minute and

1429
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,989
enjoy it I mean it's just something

1430
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,329
humans like in cannabis is great for

1431
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:33,969
that it's the safest and toxic and known

1432
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:35,829
to man every other intoxicant causes a

1433
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:37,868
lot of harm to your body cannabis

1434
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:39,789
doesn't the feds have been looking for a

1435
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:41,890
long time folks when you start doing

1436
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:44,920
your research you're gonna learn that as

1437
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:47,018
far as intoxicants go I mean even just

1438
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,000
beer and alcohol cannabis is far far

1439
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:51,578
safer so if you just prefer it over

1440
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,409
alcohol that's still a great reason to

1441
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:55,539
stand up and say hey we need to legalize

1442
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:57,608
this in my hair you don't have to be

1443
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:58,990
super sick I'm gonna take a DAB cuz

1444
00:51:57,608 --> 00:52:00,730

1445
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:02,858

1447
00:52:02,858 --> 00:52:08,108

00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:12,400
start getting educated you need to start

1450
00:52:11,018 --> 00:52:15,758
learning a couple of different things

1451
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,460
one start researching cannabis it's got

1452
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:20,798
a long and interesting history it's good

1453
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:24,159
at this point in time the medical

1454
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:26,108
research and the research on safety for

1455
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,799
consumption even if you're smoking big

1456
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:29,779
ol fat joints all the time

1457
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,550
vaporizers are a lot healthier way to

1458
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,960
consume you get to skip that burning

1459
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,330
plant material but even if you're

1460
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,740
puffing J's old school you're not doing

1461
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:39,409
the kind of damage to your body that

1462
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:42,739
tobacco smoker is it's not a one-to-one

1463
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:44,389
comparison folks get get online and

1464
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:46,309
start learning everything you can about

1465
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:48,949
cannabis you don't have to sit down and

1466
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:51,440
do it all at once but I mean if you love

1467
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:52,969
cannabis learning a lot about it and

1468
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,950
knowing that you're not killing yourself

1469
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,959
because you enjoy it that's something

1470
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:58,719
that everybody should want to do alright

1471
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,980
so while you're learning about cannabis

1472
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:04,279
start learning about the laws in your

1473
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:06,730
area if you're in the United States the

1474
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,830
internet every local government

1475
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:12,170
regardless of how small a town or area

1476
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:14,509
you live in everything's online at this

1477
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:16,880
point find out when the meetings are

1478
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,680
happening how that government structured

1479
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,500
if it's a city council or if it's a

1480
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:23,509
Board of County Commissioners or whatnot

1481
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,309
figure out when they meet and just start

1482
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:28,250
going to meetings sit in the back and

1483
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:31,009
just observe how they play out one of

1484
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,019
the things that I laugh a lot about the

1485
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,520
anti pot groups down here never did this

1486
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:36,650
step they just started showing up to

1487
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,170
meetings and shouting [ __ ] and when you

1488
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:41,210
don't know how the meetings function you

1489
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,760
don't know where to put your effort it's

1490
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,320
sort of like I don't know an idiot

1491
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,970
showing up the first day on the job and

1492
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,769
just tackling random things in the store

1493
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:50,449
like it's not helpful no matter how much

1494
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,599
energy your passion you're throwing into

1495
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:55,399
it but if you take a couple of really

1496
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,869
long boring nights these meetings can go

1497
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,579
for two or three hours at a stand and

1498
00:53:56,869 --> 00:54:03,170
just see how they flow all of them allow

1499
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:05,389
Democratic participation any member of

1500
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,280
the public can show up and if they

1501
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:10,219
follow a couple of really simple easy

1502
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,930
rules like sign up and then speak during

1503
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:15,230
the appropriate time of the meeting I

1504
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:16,879
mean really simple [ __ ] you can get up

1505
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,260
and say whatever you want as long as

1506
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,760
you're not cussing at somebody or

1507
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,680
screaming and yelling at somebody on

1508
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,540
council they'll let you rant about

1509
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:26,239
whatever they give you five full minutes

1510
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:27,949
you get six you get five minutes at the

1511
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,689
beginning every meeting down here in pub

1512
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:33,079
well you just sign up they allow six

1513
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,760
people to sign up every meeting and you

1514
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:36,769
can rant about whatever and for the most

1515
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,180
part it's these three old guys that just

1516
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:40,239
show up and [ __ ] you're gonna say

1517
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:43,759
sometimes nobody signs up

1518
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:46,399
down here has thanked me for breaking up

1519
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,810
the tedium of people that speak they

1520
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,789
don't all agree with me but they

1521
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:53,269
appreciate me going and saying something

1522
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:54,739
coherent and they're down to hear

1523
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:56,929
whatever there are people that have come

1524
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:59,659
and spoken about roadside memorials I

1525
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:01,250
mean whatever issue interests you you

1526
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:03,619
can go down and speak about so if your

1527
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,960
issue is cannabis you can show up to

1528
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:07,400
your local Town Council and if you've

1529
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,869
done your homework a little bit you can

1530
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,940
point out how many millions of dollars

1531
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:14,329
they could make if cannabis was legal in

1532
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,920
their area if you take the time to pull

1533
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:18,289
the data coming out of Colorado in

1534
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,139
Washington State it's been 18 months

1535
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:23,210
since recreational stores were open

1536
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:25,549
their doors in Colorado we've got all

1537
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:28,610
the data we need to prove just how safe

1538
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:30,920
cannabis legalization is you can have

1539
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:33,110
stores that adults 21 years of age or

1540
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,869
older can walk into if you throw the

1541
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:37,910
[ __ ] and well label childproof packaging

1542
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:41,690
it's perfectly safe there's no harm

1543
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:44,329
cause there's no increase in any duis or

1544
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,250
teen access I mean there's so much

1545
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:48,440
cannabis out there anyway all the stores

1546
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:51,320
do is change who profits from the sale

1547
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,119
and where a whole bunch of adults choose

1548
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,800
to go to buy there we'd like

1549
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,139
legalization isn't a huge

1550
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,990
earth-shattering change it's just the

1551
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:02,299
end of a lot of stupidity yes and in

1552
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:03,829
Colorado we've been keeping tally in the

1553
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,360
numbers people have been watching very

1554
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:08,059
closely this was supposed to be a

1555
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,480
nightmare all of the predictions a year

1556
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:13,340
or two ago are laughable now the local

1557
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,789
paper the chieftain does a [ __ ] job

1558
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:19,160
regularly and miracle of miracles they

1559
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:21,619
did an amazing expose on what legal

1560
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:23,179
marijuana did to our County we sold

1561
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:25,069
seventeen million dollars worth of

1562
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:29,119
marijuana and the cops can't point to a

1563
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:30,380
firm problem it's just nuts seventeen

1564
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,779
million dollars

1565
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:36,110
there's only 150,000 people down here I

1566
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:38,690
mean do the math it's not like the black

1567
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:41,390
market died it's just a huge number of

1568
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,800
people prefer going to the stores buying

1569
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:44,449
weed on the black market can be a

1570
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,640
nightmare man

1571
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:48,078
we've so spoiled in Colorado it's kind

1572
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:52,069
of hard to think back to what it used to

1573
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,780
be like yeah but a lot of people have a

1574
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:56,059
hard core dealer that they've got to

1575
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,920
deal with they they operate under deal

1576
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:59,838
dealer rules like you meet in a parking

1577
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,849
lot it's a quick exchange you're not

1578
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,159
friends you get ripped off the bags

1579
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:07,970
light it's got other crap in it it's

1580
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:09,949
never the strain they say cops looking

1581
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:12,289
to arrest you for doing it I had some

1582
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:13,759
friends in from Wisconsin they're like

1583
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:16,099
friends of a friend my good friend had

1584
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,599
family in from Wisconsin and like we

1585
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:22,670
went to the dispensary over here and I

1586
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:25,730
was like oh you went there to see what

1587
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:31,250
it was like just the experience of going

1588
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:33,800
through the store so get educated learn

1589
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,780
the laws in your area how the public

1590
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:39,740
meetings work and when and how public

1591
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:41,690
comment is taken and then look up other

1592
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:44,838
legalization groups in your area guys

1593
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:47,030
there are a ton of groups out there in

1594
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:49,460
the 1970s we were really close to

1595
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,790
Marilyn marijuana being legal too and

1596
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:55,010
when that fell apart a number of groups

1597
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:58,130
started forming nationally normals the

1598
00:57:55,010 --> 00:58:00,109
big ones if you're not if you're not

1599
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,579
familiar with normal you really really

1600
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:03,170
need to start googling stuff about

1601
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,640
cannabis that's the National

1602
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,250
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana

1603
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,650
long yes it is there's also the

1604
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,300
Marijuana Policy Project they're doing

1605
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,800
national lobbying for legalization

1606
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,818
they've helped to write a number of the

1607
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,039
laws

1608
00:58:13,818 --> 00:58:19,190
I think they helped with Colorado's they

1609
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:20,659

the idea of prohibition in 15 minutes

1633
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:19,470
it's a great place to start guys and the

1634
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,909
last organization I'd say everybody

1635
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:23,939
needs to check out is a group called

1636
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:25,460
flex your rights if you're gonna go and

1637
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,619
start speaking up about marijuana

1638
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:30,750
legalization in an area where it's not

1639
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:33,210
already medically legal or there's not a

1640
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:35,670
number of other people doing that it can

1641
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,710
be terrifying and one of the things

1642
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:40,200
that's really gonna help you feel a lot

1643
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:42,090
more secure and doing that is knowing

1644
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:43,769
what your rights are as a citizen in the

1645
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,320
good old United States of America

1646
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:48,750
flex your Rights is an organization of

1647
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,480
defense attorneys that have put together

1648
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:54,360
a number of great videos and little

1649
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,760
training web pages on flexing your

1650
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,530
rights what rights do you have when the

1651

cop pounds on your doors is open up

1652
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:03,600

1653
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,070
watch that anyway everybody everyone's

1654
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,929

videos what are your rights when you get

1656
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:11,279
pulled over during a traffic stop

1657
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:12,869
I mean I'm if you get on YouTube and

1658
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,420
watch some of the same [ __ ] I do you've

1659
01:00:12,869 --> 01:00:17,880
seen people refused to roll their window

1660
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:20,550
down and just hand or put up IDs to the

1661
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,869
window and completely refuse what the

1662
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,580
cops saying and just do something

1663
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:25,500
different and the cops all look

1664
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,840
befuddled and then the important cop

1665
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,340
walks over tells the other cops they

1666
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,900
don't get to smash the window and they

1667
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,039
don't get to ruin this guy's night and

1668
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,250
the guys free to leave

1669
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,119
learn how to do that legally I know it's

1670
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,860
terrifying

1671
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,420
just stand up in front of the police

1672
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,400
chief because the police chief said a

1673
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,130
lot of these meetings the City Council's

1674
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,360
at these meetings the city attorney

1675
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:47,039
everyone's in a suit and tie there are

1676
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:50,370
cameras rolling and you're gonna stand

1677
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,190
up and encourage them to legalize

1678
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:55,349
marijuana or to push for legalization it

1679
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,240
can be really scary but if you know your

1680
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:59,489
rights and you've paid attention in the

1681
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:01,079
meetings and you know how they flow and

1682
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,209
you make your argument at the

1683
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,460
appropriate time at the appropriate way

1684
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:07,650
they're gonna hear you they're gonna be

1685
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,420
impressed and they're gonna want to know

1686
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,079
more and so if you've done your homework

1687
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,940
and you're

1688
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,739
educated when they come up you after the

1689
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,320
meeting and go I like what you said can

1690
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:19,259
we sit down later I want to hear about

1691
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:22,260
what pot legalization might do for our

1692
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:24,870
little town here in Kentucky you can go

1693
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:27,870
to lunch later and really explain okay

1694
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:30,239
in Colorado towns this size that allowed

1695
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:32,489
this many shops made this much in tax

1696
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,969
revenue this much in application fees

1697
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:37,739
spent this much in it enforcement and so

1698
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:40,319
they're able to spend an extra this much

1699
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:42,449
on their roads this year when you make

1700
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,970
that argument to someone in local

1701
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:48,299
government they're gonna just be

1702
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:50,159
astounded if the possibilities they're

1703
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,650
gonna have to look at this issue in a

1704
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,369
new way seventeen million dollars I mean

1705
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,010

1708
01:01:57,659 --> 01:02:04,469

was a little shocked too and yeah it's a

1713
01:02:12,389 --> 01:02:17,129
big city full of a lot of people and

1714
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,920
hard times so this industry's been huge

1715
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:23,369
the jobs yeah the local an investment in

1716
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,950
the city hop on the chieftain if you go

1717
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:27,509
to the chieftain calm and scroll all the

1718
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:29,759
way down to the bottom of the page on

1719
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,010
the right hand side they've got a couple

1720
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,350
of big expose days they've done and one

1721
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:35,400
of them's called the growing trade or I

1722
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:37,079
suppose you could just google the

1723
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,059
chieftain the growing trade it brings up

1724
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,639
a big series of reports and they break

1725
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:43,500
down what the police had to say after

1726
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:46,289
the county sold seventeen million in pot

1727
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,449
last year what the teachers had to say

1728
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:51,449
in the principals what the fire

1729
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:53,789
department had to say they had tallied

1730
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:55,649
up what the county spent on enforcement

1731
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:57,599
and going out and making sure that you

1732
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,010
met zoning that you were checking IDs

1733
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,710
and all of that they added up everything

1734
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,480
we could think of that was related to

1735
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:06,150
legal pot and they tallied it in one

1736
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:10,440
column and it was like 220 grand and

1737
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:13,170
they pulled in 1.7 million I mean that's

1738
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,630
a million and a half track he'd return

1739
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,099
on a small investment yeah I mean all

1740
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,420
they had to do is get out of the way and

1741
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:20,289
I also think that we're bringing more

1742
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,530
people here because

1743
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:25,809
where I know reversible Colorado's you

1744
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:27,910
know a flood of people come in it's

1745
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:29,590
almost like the gold rushes before I'm

1746
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:34,299
just moving but visiting they're coming

1747
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:35,890
to weed and go on a hike lots of people

1748
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,870
coming to visit and check it out and

1749
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:39,279
what I'm hoping they all take home is

1750
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:42,309
when they get home they need to tell

1751
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,440
everyone they know how sane and rational

1752
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:46,449
this decision was I mean a lot of people

1753
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,970
shuck oh my god you're gonna add another

1754
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:51,699
legal intoxicant to the mix it's gonna

1755
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:53,619
be terrible for society I mean marijuana

1756
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:55,029
has never killed anyone alcohol kills

1757
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:56,650
almost a hundred thousand people a year

1758
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,990
and that's before the car crashes

1759
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:02,340
tobacco kills almost half a million

1760
01:03:58,989 --> 01:04:04,779
people every year and that's from using

1761
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,680
getting diseases from using and dying

1762
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,690
police killed more people than cannabis

1763
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,029
500 already this year just as I know

1764
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:14,920
that's that off the top of my head yeah

1765
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:17,500
peanuts kill more people in cannabis

1766
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,990
every other lightning kills 52 Americans

1767
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,670
a year I was just had to look that [ __ ]

1768
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,809
up recently alright we're getting off

1769
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,519
track here keep going because you got

1770
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:26,679
quite a bit of [ __ ] about 36 minutes I

1771
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:29,110
want to make sure you get this in all

1772
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:31,210
right so we're passionate we're educated

1773
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:33,430
we've started attending meetings and

1774
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:37,090
figuring out how they work all right so

1775
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:39,039
you're gonna start speaking out this is

1776
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:41,950
the terrifying part like it's easy to

1777
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,860
sit at home and Google does cannabis

1778
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:47,500
cure cancer and then read what dr.

1779
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:49,300
Tashjian has to say about that or to

1780
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,889
Google the history of cannabis and spend

1781
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,269
the night reading about how the federal

1782
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:54,429
government's run a medical marijuana

1783
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:57,670
program every year I've [ __ ] been

1784
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:59,529
alive it started in 1982 people they

1785
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:01,360
mail people 11 ounces of weed how the

1786
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,820
[ __ ] did you not know about this google

1787
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,450
it right now but that's easy it's not

1788
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,940
scary

1789
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:09,849
no one's gonna follow you home from that

1790
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:12,309
but going down to City Council and

1791
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:14,139
standing up at the podium and swearing

1792
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:16,750
in giving your name and address and then

1793
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:19,239
speaking out for legalization can be

1794
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:21,070
scary but if you do it right you're

1795
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:23,829
gonna succeed people are gonna hear you

1796
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:25,590
no one's gonna follow you home like it's

1797
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:27,789
even like an extra layer of protection

1798
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:29,500
because if the cops are gonna screw with

1799
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:32,519
the person that's going to City Council

1800
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,920
and making a stink it's gonna be press

1801
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:36,960
into the cops want press they're gonna

1802
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,420
bring you know of the district attorney

1803
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,190
and God know you any press right no they

1804
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,409
don't want any of that so they pretty

1805
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,730
much leave you alone I've never had an

1806
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:48,089
issue and I've been doing this for like

1807
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:50,369
six years now so what you got to do is

1808
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:53,640
figure out what you want to say and how

1809
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:55,860
you want to say it are you talking about

1810
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:58,679
medical access are you talking about

1811
01:05:55,860 --> 01:06:02,760
full-blown legalization take a few

1812
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:05,159
minutes and really pen out what you want

1813
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,080
to say make a couple of bullet point

1814
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:09,089
notes of the points you want to hit and

1815
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:11,639
then practice it a couple of times at

1816
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,410
home get yourself familiar with it

1817
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:15,719
because it can be really nerve-racking I

1818
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:17,250
hate public speaking here on the podcast

1819
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:19,139
and I love it in your kitchen

1820
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,670
you'll get shaky the first time but I

1821
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:22,230
hear a lot of people get shaky and City

1822
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,920
Council knows they look like it's

1823
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:28,079
alright and if you're struggling they'll

1824
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,639
even like it's okay you can say whatever

1825
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,079
you want you can't get in trouble here

1826
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:32,609
like they try to reassure you a little

1827
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,690
bit even if they disagree with you if

1828
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:37,230
they see that you're nervous they're

1829
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:38,670
really nice about it but plan out what

1830
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:40,980
you want to say practice it a couple of

1831
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:44,280
times at home and then go down to the

1832
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:45,929
meeting or just throw on clean clothes

1833
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,390
like that's the key people you don't

1834
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:54,690
have to dress way up I go in jeans and a

1835
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:57,480
button-down shirt if you've got dreads

1836
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:59,639
time back neat if you've got a big beard

1837
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,858
maybe clean it up a little bit but just

1838
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:03,599
clean clothes look nice you don't have

1839
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,190
to go buy a suit or anything honestly

1840
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,900
there are some guys that come in there

1841
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:08,970
looking like they just and they're

1842
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,769
wearing their work uniform you depth and

1843
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:12,389
they're like hey I'm part of this Union

1844
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:14,130
and you're like oh I could tell don't

1845
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:16,139
feel like and we feel this way and I

1846
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,579
think that shows that they're a working

1847
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:19,230
[ __ ] man and that they're speaking

1848
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:20,940
about what they've got to do you know

1849
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,469
what I mean right if you're coming

1850
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,030
straight from work it's perfectly

1851
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:25,858
appropriate to show up and whatever you

1852
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,910
were wearing that day people do that all

1853
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:28,500
the time because most of these meetings

1854
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,000
are like six o'clock at night and that's

1855
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,909
pretty much when everybody's headed home

1856
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,320
we've got a normal job so just throw on

1857
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:36,089
something clean if you can get yourself

1858
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,039
cleaned up a little bit practice what

1859
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:41,010
you're gonna say then go down sign up

1860
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:43,349
and say it so uh yeah throw on a clean

1861
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:46,080
shirt go down and go down sign up and

1862
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:48,089
speak be polite

1863
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,869
I like to start off with good evening

1864
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:54,840
Council I think going like gentlemen and

1865
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:56,339
lady makes you sound like a dick so if

1866
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,930
there's you know men and women on the

1867
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,910
council you can just skip all of that

1868
01:07:57,929 --> 01:08:01,710
nonsense with good evening Council or

1869
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,779
good evening board county commissioners

1870
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,760
just use their formal title and then say

1871
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,890
what you've got to say and then at the

1872
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,780
end try to say thank you free thank you

1873
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:11,190
for you know giving me this chance to

1874
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,260
speak tonight they really appreciate it

1875
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,150
when people thank them and hang out at

1876
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:17,070
the meeting like that's the part that

1877
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:19,920
everyone regardless of their issues

1878
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:25,079
skips the night you go speak at the

1879
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:27,539
meeting nine times out of ten when the

1880
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:30,029
the section of time where the public can

1881
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:32,010
speak is over everyone in the meeting

1882
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:34,199
shuffles out the City Council down here

1883
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:36,630
even pauses for a minute to allow it to

1884
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:40,108
happen but the very next step of the

1885
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:42,150
meeting is council commentary well where

1886
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:43,950
they sit in banter back and forth for a

1887
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:46,079
few minutes about what they just heard

1888
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:49,439
and about other [ __ ] that's come up that

1889
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:52,680
week and that's the important part of

1890
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,869
the meeting if you're arguing with them

1891
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,460
about anything

1892
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:59,460
knowing the issues City Council cares

1893
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,779
about knowing the different projects

1894
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,149
they're working on in the city

1895
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:05,759
knowing out of the hundreds of emails

1896
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:07,559
they get each week which one or two they

1897
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,270
choose to bring up it's City Council as

1898
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,850
though it's a folksy [ __ ] anecdote

1899
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:14,040
like knowing that stuff helps you

1900
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,960
structure your argument maybe it'll help

1901
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:18,569
you figure out which one of those

1902
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,130
council members is on your side it can

1903
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:22,079
kind of buddy up with them especially

1904
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:24,029
after you've spoken because they

1905
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:25,500
frequently discuss what they heard that

1906
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:27,809
night before and I can't tell you how

1907
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,699
many times I've heard I wish the person

1908
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:31,650
who spoke earlier was still in this room

1909
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:33,210
because we'd like to thank him for

1910
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:34,889
coming and speaking out and you know

1911
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:37,020
when we know it's tough to do and it out

1912
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:38,730
it out the last one was this this really

1913
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:41,400
sweet kid he was super nervous he kept

1914
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:42,959
stopped and I heard him talking before

1915
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:44,369
the meeting he didn't have a stammer he

1916
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,319
fully had a stammer while he was

1917
01:09:44,369 --> 01:09:49,710
testifying and he was talking about the

1918
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:52,439
homeless problem down here and he left

1919
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:55,350
immediately after he spoke and the

1920
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:57,809
council spent maybe 20 minutes debating

1921
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:59,700
the issue and gathering city restore a

1922
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:00,120
schema city manager about resources to

1923
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:02,939
help to

1924
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:04,409
with his issue or to address some of the

1925
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:05,579
issues the kid brought up and it would

1926
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:07,470
have been very few was there for that

1927
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:09,449
but he was already go he was gone and I

1928
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,039
doubt he'll pull it up online later I've

1929
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:13,529
been there when they have called upon

1930
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,180
you to answer a cannabis question like

1931
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:16,679
Michael are you here the one guys like

1932
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,659
that guy over there knows let him speak

1933
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,180
and you just stand up like the answer is

1934
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:24,059
this the people look at you like you're

1935
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:25,950
a [ __ ] robot so some you guys can all

1936
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:28,560
become that guy for council and don't

1937
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:30,840
expect it to happen overnight I've been

1938
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,450
watching Mike do this for probably eight

1939
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,420
years it takes a lot of time folks it

1940
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:39,539
when you first go at best you're the

1941
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:42,569
articulate guy talking about weed the

1942
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:44,220
fifth time you go and speak you're the

1943
01:10:42,569 --> 01:10:46,079
really articulate guy who comes to

1944
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,390
meetings and knows what he's talking

1945
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,729
about and it's really seems to know you

1946
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:52,470
know he's presenting an argument in a

1947
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:54,359
way that a lot of people are really

1948
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:57,390
starting to listen to and after the

1949
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:59,429
first year or so you're the person they

1950
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:01,829
think of when that issue comes up I

1951
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:04,770
should get a hold of that guy and ask

1952
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:06,269
him what his take on this issue is now I

1953
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:09,660
get two or three calls a week from

1954
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:11,460
reporters down here some up sometimes

1955
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:14,000
fact-checking a story they're doing

1956
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:16,649
sometimes asking for my take on an issue

1957
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,539
I'm forever running to the news run to

1958
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:19,889
the newsstand grab a paper like it's

1959
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:21,689
just something that comes up after you

1960
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:23,160
start doing it for a while we'll be in

1961
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:31,679
the car and both of our phones will ring

1962
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:33,569
and it's the same reporter this odd

1963
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,400
cannabis question I've been in the car

1964
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:36,449
with Mike and City Council members have

1965
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:40,519
called him he's like turn down the music

1966
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:40,519
dude they got the reggae full blast

1967
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:46,769
you'll have to turn that down the

1968
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:50,100
meetings are real formal and there's

1969
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:51,990
it's so procedural and there's police

1970
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,030
officers in the heads of the city or the

1971
01:11:51,989 --> 01:11:58,489
town or whatever there so it seems

1972
01:11:54,029 --> 01:12:01,050
really rigid in kind of terrifying but

1973
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:03,479
once you've gone a few times you see

1974
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:05,340
that it's just bored politicians who

1975
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:09,179
desperately want someone else to give a

1976
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:10,949
[ __ ] and they're super happy to have

1977
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,810
anyone come down to the meetings and be

1978
01:12:10,949 --> 01:12:14,489
interested the whole time the only tea

1979
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,170
that are there are paid to be there or

1980
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:18,809
people that are asking for something

1981
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:22,380
when you start showing up is the guy

1982
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:24,420
saying I've done my homework I figured

1983
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:28,770
out that marijuana legalization could

1984
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:30,420
save our County $100,000 and make our

1985
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,950
County two hundred thousand dollars on

1986
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:35,310
top of that so it's three hundred grand

1987
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:37,439
total they freak the [ __ ] out everybody

1988
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,660
else goes here's my issue I need ten

1989
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,419
grand here's my issue I need thirty five

1990
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:46,069
grand or even 50 bucks Youth Center

1991
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:49,050
needs another three thousand dollars yep

1992
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:51,630
when you show up and say I found a way

1993
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:53,699
for you to make a huge amount of money

1994
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:56,220
order a way to bring a whole bunch of

1995
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:58,889
jobs to our area I mean when you tell

1996
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,869
your argument well you can really hit

1997
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,820
these people in ways that they're gonna

1998
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:04,649
go home thinking about Mike is giving

1999
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:08,809
you guys like 12 good points to make the

2000
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:11,729
tax money that it's bringing in the job

2001
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:13,440
guys bunch of head starts collar I mean

2002
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:15,029
ten years ago when I was studying this

2003
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,119
stuff in college it was all theoretical

2004
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:20,250
we could guess what legalization might

2005
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,529
do to an area we could look at Amsterdam

2006
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:26,130
and kind of guesstimate what that would

2007
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:27,750
look like in Denver but it's been 15

2008
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:31,650
years since our medical marijuana laws

2009
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:34,229
passed 2008 was the dispensary explosion

2010
01:13:31,649 --> 01:13:36,239
with the Medical Marijuana heyday that

2011
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:40,849
we always talk about on the show that

2012
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:43,229
was 2008 no seven years ago and so

2013
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,020
that's been collected over all the time

2014
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:48,059
all that time the cops were sure this

2015
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,130
was gonna lead to the apocalypse the

2016
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:52,230
rehab industry was sure this was gonna

2017
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:54,750
lead the apocalypse the government was

2018
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:57,119
sure and so everybody was keeping

2019
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:59,340
records the Department of Revenue in

2020
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,769
Colorado you can go on their website and

2021
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,260
look pull the tax numbers by county man

2022
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:06,360
you can see what the 1% kickback that

2023
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,640
the generating area gets from the state

2024
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:11,219
adds up to for every little town that

2025
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,930
allows it and so you can pull those

2026
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:16,230
numbers wherever you are on the planet

2027
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:18,570
now and say our little town has 40,000

2028
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:21,449
people I've done the math and we can

2029
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:23,489
make this much or save this much make

2030
01:14:21,449 --> 01:14:25,289
this much definitely yep I'm not little

2031
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,630
but I mean over a year's time

2032
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:30,420
now you've seen what we did we made 17

2033
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,400
million dollars you're not experimenting

2034
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:34,350
anymore you're just looking at the

2035
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,449
reality and choosing the course that

2036
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:38,760

growers and stuff we're gonna skip the

2191
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:16,050
intro because Clint already crashed the

2192
01:24:03,449 --> 01:24:17,369
whole [ __ ] podcast I'm recording by

2193
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,989
myself it seems like I have a really

2194
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:20,369
hard time busting out the intro when I'm

2195
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:30,989
alone but when there are people here it

2196
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:32,609
flows out like I should just turn your

2197
01:24:30,989 --> 01:24:34,380
microphone down and just dipped you down

2198
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:39,809
until I introduced you but I just kept

2199
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:41,609
yelling me today is my friend Clint he's

2200
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:42,930
a local comedian at least that's what he

2201
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:49,559
claims to be you've already seen his

2202
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:51,659
skills Clint is an amateur pot smoker he

2203
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:58,560

2254
01:27:11,449 --> 01:27:15,470
deal you know what I mean like what if

2255
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:18,169
this podcast became like a real big deal

2256
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:20,840
just in Pueblo you know just like when a

2257
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:22,369
comedian would come down or when a band

2258
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:24,739
had come through it'd be cool for them

2259
01:27:22,369 --> 01:27:26,689
to like man it'd be cool to go to get a

2260
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:28,189
little bit to eye with Ross to Jeff you

2261
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:30,500
know like it's the morning radio show

2262
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:34,368
before before the show kind of but like

2263
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:37,038
more so like it's a gift for smokey it's

2264
01:27:34,368 --> 01:27:39,049
it almost be like that it'd be great to

2265
01:27:37,038 --> 01:27:41,059
have that radio show idea so what you're

2266
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:43,820
saying is that since the wild cousins

2267
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:46,128
are presenting a comedy show with a man

2268
01:27:43,819 --> 01:27:49,279
by the name of Sam talent funniest man

2269
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:51,288
I've ever saw on July 23rd 2015 at the

2270
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:53,418
rainbow bar are you saying that maybe we

2271
01:27:51,288 --> 01:27:55,368
should have Sam talent come be on the

2272
01:27:53,418 --> 01:27:56,689
podcast and be a little bit funny and we

2273
01:27:55,368 --> 01:27:58,339
could talk to him about his cannabis

2274
01:27:56,689 --> 01:28:02,030
experience maybe he's got a funny weed

2275
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:04,399
story I you know what let me ask him I

2276
01:28:02,029 --> 01:28:05,179
will ask him all right and I would love

2277
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:10,099
for that to happen

2278
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:11,929
all right great Clint is going to try to

2279
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:13,519
get a comedian by the name of Sam talent

2280
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:15,800
on the show here and then he's going to

2281
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:19,519
do a show at the rainbow bar July 23rd

2282
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,958
2015 it is a free show but donations are

2283
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:23,179

listening to this show show up pay $5

2285
01:28:23,179 --> 01:28:26,029
because that's what I feel you should do

2286
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:27,800
the show will be worth five dollars pay

2287
01:28:26,029 --> 01:28:29,628
five dollars don't go be a cheap ass

2288
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,309
it's a free show you look like a pimp if

2289
01:28:29,628 --> 01:28:33,288
you throw down five four the free show I

2290
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:35,360
think you should do it for sure dude all

2291
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:37,788
right that's that's a funny show that's

2292
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:40,609
got my buddy Paul Rosales and my other

2293
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:43,099
buddy John bueno on that show and that

2294
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:45,978
is my little commie crew called the wild

2295
01:28:43,099 --> 01:28:47,719
cousins Shantanu the wild cousins my

2296
01:28:45,979 --> 01:28:49,458
wild cousins shirt yesterday people like

2297
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:51,649
to give me the weirdest looks I love it

2298
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:52,300
- this shirt has a kitty cat shooting an

2299
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:54,709
assault rifle

2300
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,998
definitely I'm a six foot five dude with

2301
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:57,918
dreadlocks and people look at me with

2302
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:59,688
great confusion it's just such a weird

2303
01:28:57,918 --> 01:29:01,189
shirt I don't know I love it we got a

2304
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:03,260
whole bunch of them and we just like

2305
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:05,840
have never tried to sell them it's so

2306
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:08,449
fun that we just gave up on them

2307
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,189
immediately I'm thinking about getting

2308
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:11,868
growth from your heart podcast t-shirts

2309
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:13,699
made here eventually I'd rock one of

2310
01:29:11,868 --> 01:29:14,868
those hopefully by episode 100 I'll be

2311
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,609
able to give a couple of them away

2312
01:29:14,868 --> 01:29:22,368
should talk to Barrett shoutout to

2313
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:24,259
Barrett lastly if I think is mo mo right

2314
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:27,228
yes oh I thought they were together

2315
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:29,329
there Moe's not doing shirts though mo I

2316
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:30,860
think unless Barrett bought up most [ __ ]

2317
01:29:29,328 --> 01:29:32,509
and they just call it the same thing so

2318
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:34,219
this just got real local what's up guys

2319
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:36,590
we're gonna go back to talking about

2320
01:29:34,219 --> 01:29:38,569
funny weed [ __ ] so we went Doug Benson

2321
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:40,279
YES on 4/20 we saw Doug Benson he did

2322
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:41,748
three shows at The Comedy Works shadows

2323
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:43,340

2324
01:29:41,748 --> 01:29:45,319
club on the planet first really quickly

2325
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,670
I always shot it to Baker Baker I was

2326
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:48,469
watching my

2327
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:50,029
school broadcast last night and having a

2328
01:29:48,469 --> 01:29:54,260
conversation with me and I was slightly

2329
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:55,880
honored dude he came out and shook my

2330
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,650
hand the other day I recognized him I

2331
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,119
waved at him and you recognized me

2332
01:29:57,649 --> 01:30:02,809

2333
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:04,779

2336
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:15,738
actually moved pretty fast I'm getting

2337
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:17,780
rambley again guys this is great because

2338
01:30:15,738 --> 01:30:19,399
I've never seen Clint this high and he's

2339
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:21,229
almost uncomfortably high and I can see

2340
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:22,729
him like resituated himself every few

2341
01:30:21,229 --> 01:30:23,869
minutes so it's great and that's gonna

2342
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:25,159
lead into something we're gonna talk

2343
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:26,659
about in a little bit here too if we

2344
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:33,319
have time because clunk keeps uh talking

2345
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:34,399
a lot so four episodes later yes I was

2346
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:35,929
going to make a reference and then I

2347
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:38,029
forgot the dude's name so we won't even

2348
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:40,060
do it it feels like you are

2349
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:42,039
[Music]

2350
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:43,690
keep holding me that's what's happening

2351
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:46,000
here I'm being Pete Holmes if you ever

2352
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:47,559
watch any of Doug Benson's podcast Pete

2353
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,430
Holmes will love to just interrupt and

2354
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:54,400
drag on yes you are European holding me

2355
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:55,570
so we're going to do a little on 4/20

2356
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,909
Doug came and did those comedy shows

2357
01:30:55,569 --> 01:30:59,380
right at Comedy Works Clint and I and a

2358
01:30:57,909 --> 01:31:03,220
couple other people had the honor of

2359
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:05,230
going to the third show that night which

2360
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:08,079
may have been a mistake we've talked

2361
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:10,479
about that on the podcast yes yes we did

2362
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:15,399
so we downloaded the CD on the day that

2363
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:16,659
it came out and we listened to it and so

2364
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:19,750
the fun part that I noticed right away

2365
01:31:16,659 --> 01:31:22,000
is he used the opening from the show we

2366
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:23,229
attended for sure he did yeah cuz he

2367
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,840
talked about how he was trying to get to

2368
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:27,669
high oh dude well yeah that that was

2369
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,970
definite and it's not like you could

2370
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:33,190
have done that twice no but even even

2371
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:35,350
later in the album you can hear him and

2372
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:37,179
he's not that high right and it's just

2373
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:38,560
like oh man I wish I'd have went to

2374
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,860
those other shows right there were a

2375
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:44,260
couple of pieces that I'm certain came

2376
01:31:40,859 --> 01:31:45,939
from our show I know that there's some

2377
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:48,880
like oh he did not do that in our show

2378
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:51,879
cause he sounds awake parts of the

2379
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,010
entire album is the on track one there

2380
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:57,430
are multiple times when I can hear Clint

2381
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:58,930
over laughing Clint is dead oh no it's

2382
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:00,490
great dude because it's genuine but

2383
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,829
you're laughing you're such a big dude

2384
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:04,840
and your laugh is so low that it just

2385
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:06,430
shakes the entire comedy club when you

2386
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,739
laugh and we're in the front row in that

2387
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:11,020
little pit area there's a lot of sound

2388
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:20,609
right there and through on the mic so

2389
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:24,130
well that's pretty cool it was great

2390
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:28,000
thing is the comedy album not that funny

2391
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:39,069
you know what sucks I might have been

2392
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:41,229
the funniest thing on that album but you

2393
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:42,670
know you're being honest I just didn't

2394
01:32:41,229 --> 01:32:44,199
think it was that good we went and saw

2395
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:46,630
that show and that I had a prejudice

2396
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:48,470
against it already though because I was

2397
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:51,409
a little mad at him so the first

2398
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:54,860
tract is 25 minutes of Doug reading

2399
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:56,630
tweets on his comedy album like I know

2400
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:58,729
that's it's what he does in his live

2401
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:00,680
show but he's just riffing off of um

2402
01:32:58,729 --> 01:33:02,299
yeah if I was going to do a comedy album

2403
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,100
if I were a comedian I would put

2404
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:06,079
together I would Joe Rogan that [ __ ] I

2405
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:07,880
would put together the tightest one hour

2406
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,399
that I could come and it might take you

2407
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:14,329
two years to do it I'm real happy to do

2408
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:16,879
it exactly yeah so the first album is 25

2409
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:18,829
minutes of him reading tweets the first

2410
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,930
track the second track is called watch

2411
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:22,850
this not that where he plays a game that

2412
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:24,650
he normally plays on his podcast for

2413
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:27,680
free for free and it felt like I paid

2414
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:28,670
$5.00 to download a podcast basically

2415
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,560
because I listened to his podcast

2416
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,779
frequently and it didn't feel any better

2417
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,910
than that that son of a [ __ ] turned 50

2418
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:37,789
on us and all the sudden he became a

2419
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:49,159
money-hungry [ __ ] capitalist he

2420
01:33:37,789 --> 01:33:51,170
doesn't even smoke we this is all the

2421
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:53,949
album like I was saying the first track

2422
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:56,149
is reading tweets the second track is

2423
01:33:53,949 --> 01:33:57,859
talking about something that he normally

2424
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:59,479
does on his podcast then he actually

2425
01:33:57,859 --> 01:34:01,339
tells a joke and then he tells a couple

2426
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:02,929
more jokes and then he promotes his

2427
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:04,670
other podcasts and then he promotes

2428
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:07,130
another podcast and then he promotes his

2429
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:08,449
other podcast and then he talks about

2430
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:10,760
traveling and then he actually does a

2431
01:34:08,449 --> 01:34:12,679
really good joke it's not a

2432
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,119
well-put-together album and that sucks

2433
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,340
because Doug's one of my favorite people

2434
01:34:14,119 --> 01:34:18,289
he's my friend I call Doug my friend he

2435
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:19,940
knows who I am you know we contact each

2436
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:21,439
other and to see one of your friends put

2437
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:29,239
something out like that it's almost like

2438
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:31,460
oh the comedian will start with a decent

2439
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:32,899
story and tell you a couple jokes by the

2440
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,819
time you forgotten about that first

2441
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:36,920
story I'll tell you another part that

2442
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:38,989
reminds you of that that refers to that

2443
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,460
to make you laugh Doug has already

2444
01:34:38,989 --> 01:34:42,139
forgotten the first part of his act by

2445
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:43,810
the time he's 20 minutes in he can't do

2446
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:46,130
a call that's what I'm doing right now

2447
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:48,050
we got Clint to buy today Clint got

2448
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:56,119
himself to you I sorry guys that's all

2449
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:57,529
right we're gonna make it rock if you

2450
01:34:56,119 --> 01:34:59,869
could give Doug Benson's album up to

2451
01:34:57,529 --> 01:35:01,250
five pot leaves one is a scale of 1 to 5

2452
01:34:59,869 --> 01:35:02,198
pot leaves how many leaves you gonna

2453
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,269
give him

2454
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:05,799
he's gonna get one pot leaf he's gonna

2455
01:35:04,269 --> 01:35:08,110
get one pot leaf so yeah I'll give him

2456
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,340
two maybe two and a half or three but it

2457
01:35:08,109 --> 01:35:12,308
definitely was not a four or five star

2458
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:15,369
performance yeah he's your friend and I

2459
01:35:12,309 --> 01:35:18,418
think you're being generous I think I'm

2460
01:35:15,368 --> 01:35:23,648
being mean to but there's just so many

2461
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:26,319
there's so much to do out there now like

2462
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:30,369
I could download anything yeah and if

2463
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:34,779
that's that bad album right there is my

2464
01:35:30,368 --> 01:35:36,938
only introduction to Doug Benson that's

2465
01:35:34,779 --> 01:35:39,340
the only thing I know of him other than

2466
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:42,820
his podcast yeah so I am the perfect

2467
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:45,399
demographic to go do it like I'm not a

2468
01:35:42,819 --> 01:35:47,349
cult follower so I wouldn't I'm mad that

2469
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:50,199
I bought this I'm mad that I went to

2470
01:35:47,349 --> 01:35:51,729
that show a little bit there's 25 bucks

2471
01:35:50,198 --> 01:36:06,518
that you spent on disappointing being

2472
01:35:51,729 --> 01:36:11,189
disappointed twice now yeah all right so

2473
01:36:06,519 --> 01:36:11,189
we're gonna move on from your album dude

2474
01:36:11,969 --> 01:36:15,819

2477
01:36:17,618 --> 01:36:20,438
you there at the Comedy Works in Denver

2478
01:36:18,729 --> 01:36:25,689
I've already got tickets I'm not sure

2479
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:27,969
that Clint wants to go but I'll be there

2480
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:30,280
don't worry I just wasn't I like the way

2481
01:36:27,969 --> 01:36:31,809
that oops put together a comedy album I

2482
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:36,969
like we already put together a comedy

2483
01:36:31,809 --> 01:36:38,649
album it's got more continuity is the

2484
01:36:36,969 --> 01:36:41,019
word I'm looking for it flows a little

2485
01:36:38,649 --> 01:36:43,479
bit better yeah I'd prefer that out of a

2486
01:36:41,019 --> 01:36:45,429
comedy to watch that burr album you know

2487
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:53,800
I did see that one do the black and

2488
01:36:45,429 --> 01:36:55,899
white one what's it called that's that's

2489
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:58,329
hard to be like all right well here's

2490
01:36:55,899 --> 01:37:01,030
here's this guy who's perfect at this

2491
01:36:58,328 --> 01:37:04,238
like that's Bill burr to me he's perfect

2492
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:06,609
at it he's yeah he works so hard at it

2493
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:08,768
and it's so exciting to watch somebody

2494
01:37:06,609 --> 01:37:12,069
be perfect at something Anthony Jeselnik

2495
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:13,889
is damn near perfect it's just I think

2496
01:37:12,069 --> 01:37:19,319
the Jeselnik

2497
01:37:13,889 --> 01:37:21,179
has his routine but bill burr could just

2498
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:23,759
go off on anything okay

2499
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:26,069
hey it's [ __ ] lovely it's so

2500
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:29,070
beautiful to watch and so most of those

2501
01:37:26,069 --> 01:37:31,319
bits that he has he's kind to have

2502
01:37:29,069 --> 01:37:33,148
improvising as he's telling the joke

2503
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:34,738
he knows how long and what beats he

2504
01:37:33,149 --> 01:37:37,139
wants to hit but it's not like that

2505
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:39,299
regimented I say it like this

2506
01:37:37,139 --> 01:37:41,609
Jess Lynette kind of way and Jeselnik is

2507
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:44,010
kind of a robot in that well I've said

2508
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:46,408
it plenty of times like he counts yeah

2509
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:47,849
she counts three I can see his throat

2510
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:50,938
moving when he counts yeah I can see him

2511
01:37:47,849 --> 01:37:53,099
say the word 11 yeah that's what I'm

2512
01:37:50,939 --> 01:37:54,989
saying it's like he bill burr can go in

2513
01:37:53,099 --> 01:37:56,998
there and do his routine and then break

2514
01:37:54,988 --> 01:37:58,859
away and do some dance moves and then go

2515
01:37:56,998 --> 01:38:00,840
back to the routine yeah and I love that

2516
01:37:58,859 --> 01:38:03,408
about a comedian Proops has that ability

2517
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,668
as well oh he's so [ __ ] smart yeah

2518
01:38:03,408 --> 01:38:08,638
well when we were talking to him when he

2519
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:10,319
smacked you that day it was just so much

2520
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,599
fun just he was just being in the room

2521
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:14,819
with him fun he's got that storyteller

2522
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:16,590
personality they need to get Greg Proops

2523
01:38:14,819 --> 01:38:17,779
on this is not happening that would be

2524
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:20,010
[ __ ] awesome

2525
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:20,609
these three or two is coming out pretty

2526
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,199
soon all right

2527
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:23,219
we're way off topic we're rambly but

2528
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:24,448
that's all right Clint's coming back

2529
01:38:23,219 --> 01:38:26,368
around I could feel him connecting a

2530
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:27,839
little more yeah the the goldfish in his

2531
01:38:26,368 --> 01:38:29,848
brain is not swimming in such short

2532
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:56,279
circles that lapse we've gotten larger

2533
01:38:29,849 --> 01:38:58,918
sweetie birds now and it was a good

2534
01:38:56,279 --> 01:39:08,069
question for Clint because they said how

2535
01:38:58,918 --> 01:39:10,288
much should I be smoking this I can't

2536
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:13,049
that's the beauty of cannabis if you're

2537
01:39:10,288 --> 01:39:14,819
using medical marijuana the beauty of it

2538
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:16,498
is that it's up to you that's why you

2539
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:18,179
have chosen to medicate yourself with

2540
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:19,918
medical marijuana because some doctor

2541
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:23,158
isn't saying take two of these every so

2542
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:25,920
often it's up to you to figure out

2543
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:27,960
how many puffs off of this bowl or how

2544
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,420
much of this joint I need to smoke to

2545
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:33,060
ease my medical condition and then you

2546
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,350
wanna you're gonna have to I guess if

2547
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:37,260
you've never smoked light up a joint

2548
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:38,760
take two puffs and then see how that

2549
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:40,530
does if that's way too much next time

2550
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:42,659
only take one if that didn't do it take

2551
01:39:40,529 --> 01:39:44,429
three next time make a smaller joy yeah

2552
01:39:42,658 --> 01:39:47,698
roll a smaller joint and don't get as

2553
01:39:44,429 --> 01:39:49,889
high but it's hard for me to tell you

2554
01:39:47,698 --> 01:39:52,049
how much you should be smoking because

2555
01:39:49,889 --> 01:39:54,630
we just watch Clint take three hits off

2556
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:57,840
of a bowl of some pretty high grade Sour

2557
01:39:54,630 --> 01:40:00,960
Diesel and he is high and Jeff took two

2558
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:03,179
I took and then two [ __ ] dabs and I'm

2559
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:07,260
about to take another tab like [ __ ]

2560
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:11,699
dabs my friend Clint says dabs or drugs

2561
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:15,090
drugs it's all about what you need are

2562
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:17,549
you smoking to medicate yourself or if

2563
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:19,219
you're smoking to prevent seizures yeah

2564
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:23,489
smoke as much as you want dude smoke

2565
01:40:19,219 --> 01:40:25,469
like it's really just smoke until you're

2566
01:40:23,488 --> 01:40:27,479
comfortable yeah as long as you're

2567
01:40:25,469 --> 01:40:29,789
smoking isn't hindering your ability to

2568
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:32,189
be a productive person as long as it's

2569
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:34,469
not causing you a financial problem a

2570
01:40:32,189 --> 01:40:36,658
health problem a mental problem a

2571
01:40:34,469 --> 01:40:40,139
motivational problem a relationship

2572
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:42,839
problem as long as you're not using it

2573
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:46,859
as a crutch as long as it's not an

2574
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:48,510
anchor as long as it's not causing a

2575
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:50,939
problem is my point here smoke as much

2576
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:52,829
as you feel comfortable with I don't

2577
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:54,479
recommend every day trying to see how

2578
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:55,979
high you can get you don't need to be

one by myself there's out throughout a

2694
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:00,519
course of a day and you would see those

2695
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:02,018
are days when I'm sitting

2696
01:46:00,519 --> 01:46:04,510
not doing [ __ ] but those are actually

2697
01:46:02,019 --> 01:46:06,579
the days when I'm doing the most yeah I

2698
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:08,380
don't know how I do it but I'll stop and

2699
01:46:06,578 --> 01:46:09,189
take four or five fat dad's you go right

2700
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:10,989
back to work

2701
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:13,988
work for an hour to take four or five

2702
01:46:10,988 --> 01:46:15,609
more dashes right back to work yeah cuz

2703
01:46:13,988 --> 01:46:17,649
you're busy and you got your mind going

2704
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:21,038
so like the high doesn't stick around as

2705
01:46:17,649 --> 01:46:22,118
much at least like you're using it

2706
01:46:21,038 --> 01:46:23,498
though you know how at the end of the

2707
01:46:22,118 --> 01:46:24,969
day your back hurts and you're all sore

2708
01:46:23,498 --> 01:46:29,019
if you've been doing work I don't get

2709
01:46:24,969 --> 01:46:30,760
that because my muscles stay loose and

2710
01:46:29,019 --> 01:46:32,440
relax I'm like I guess it's like going

2711
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:34,719
to taken to leave you know instead of

2712
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:36,460
taking Aleve or Tylenol or trickle

2713
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,868

2716
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:44,919

can work for like 12 hours state then

2725
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:07,149
they started picking at your skin and

2726
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:08,710
said Jeff and apparently part of the

2727
01:47:07,149 --> 01:47:10,809
frosting was stuck to my arm here and

2728
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:13,899

the donut frosting dingleberry I like

2735
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,289
that I don't know why I hope that you

2736
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:45,300
consider that for the name of this

2737
01:47:38,288 --> 01:47:47,380
episode I warned I warned them

2738
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:49,630
immediately when they were coming on if

2739
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:52,118
they're still with us yeah you guys are

2740
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:56,260
soldiers nuts soldier on what else we

2741
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:58,058
got alright holy crap guys don't smoke

2742
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:59,920
as much as Clint did but smoke as much

2743
01:47:58,059 --> 01:48:01,210
as I did and that's that's funny because

2744
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,998
that's a good example I have probably

2745
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:05,948
consumed since Clint's been here five

2746
01:48:03,998 --> 01:48:07,779
dabs I'm gonna guess five four

2747
01:48:05,948 --> 01:48:11,018
my dad's at least since blitz been here

2748
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:12,189
for two puffs off of that bowl and of

2749
01:48:11,019 --> 01:48:13,840
course I've been smoking throughout the

2750
01:48:12,189 --> 01:48:16,928
day you know it's seven o'clock almost

2751
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:19,719
so I've probably had 12 today oh and I

2752
01:48:16,929 --> 01:48:21,788
smoked nothing all day today and plant

2753
01:48:19,719 --> 01:48:23,889
is ruined I'm not gonna let Clint drive

2754
01:48:21,788 --> 01:48:27,399
for at least another hour oh for sure

2755
01:48:23,889 --> 01:48:30,038
and I could pass any sobriety test that

2756
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:33,308
you needed me to right now yeah beat a

2757
01:48:30,038 --> 01:48:35,380
smartass I'm gonna burp but I really

2758
01:48:33,309 --> 01:48:37,719
could pass almost any sobriety test you

2759
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:40,090
offered me yeah it's all about your body

2760
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:41,679
chemistry where you're used to being

2761
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:43,449
where you're trying to be come on

2762
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,670
dreadlocks or how long your dreadlocks

2763
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:46,899
are that's funny because I've seen some

2764
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:52,139
people with dreads trying to be cool and

2765
01:48:46,899 --> 01:48:52,138
they can't keep up at all with me

2766

[Music]

2767
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:05,739
somebody also sent me a message about

2768
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:08,498
trim machines they said how do you feel

2769
01:49:05,738 --> 01:49:09,968
about trim machines honestly you're

2770
01:49:08,498 --> 01:49:11,920
gonna think I'm a prick the [ __ ] a trim

2771
01:49:09,969 --> 01:49:14,078
machine a trim machine ruins your trim I

2772
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,769
chopped up the it makes a Messier buds

2773
01:49:14,078 --> 01:49:21,368
ah high-grade top-shelf cannabis is hand

2774
01:49:17,769 --> 01:49:23,708
trimmed trim machines don't have fingers

2775
01:49:21,368 --> 01:49:26,439
or eyes they don't care they don't put

2776
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:28,300
in love they may know the buds I think

2777
01:49:26,439 --> 01:49:29,948
if you've got a nice bud and you run it

2778
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:31,809
through a trim machine it's not gonna

2779
01:49:29,948 --> 01:49:33,219
take off all the leaf in one spot and it

2780
01:49:31,809 --> 01:49:34,659
will take off some of the button some

2781
01:49:33,219 --> 01:49:36,158
spa and this is from experience I've

2782
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:38,920
helped other people use trim machines we

2783
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:41,379
use the spin Pro I've seen the the Grimm

2784
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:43,449
or the trim Reaper I've seen the tsunami

2785
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:46,179
thing I don't like the way any of them

2786
01:49:43,448 --> 01:49:49,478
work also what it does is it turns your

2787
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:51,368
trim into a mulch it chops it up into

2788
01:49:49,479 --> 01:49:54,340
this really funky mulch and then it

2789
01:49:51,368 --> 01:49:57,429
almost creates too many cuts so that the

2790
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:59,860
moisture seeps out of the leave the

2791
01:49:57,429 --> 01:50:01,479
leaves or the trim in a weird way and it

2792
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:03,158
doesn't it'll it'll mold up there's

2793
01:50:01,479 --> 01:50:05,969
almost no way to prevent that [ __ ] from

2794
01:50:03,158 --> 01:50:08,948
turning moldy so I like to hand trim

2795
01:50:05,969 --> 01:50:11,170
that way you can separate the big leaves

2796
01:50:08,948 --> 01:50:13,208
from the good trim and you can know what

2797
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:16,479
you're making hash with and nobody's

2798
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:18,630
gonna trim it like a person like if the

2799
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:20,130
dispensaries they've got

2800
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:22,350
of trimmers that hand drip everything

2801
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:23,850
and they don't go as quickly as a

2802
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:25,890
trimmer but I think it's well worth it

2803
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:28,800
you can see the difference it's a whole

2804
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:30,360
bunch of like 22 to 28 year old people

2805
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,920
they just want to trim all day they're

2806
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:33,509
eager to get into the cannabis business

2807
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,890
and they just want to trim so they just

2808
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:37,020
kick ass all day in hopes of getting

2809
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:39,329
promoted to a budtender or a grower and

2810
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:41,100
that's who does the trimming I'd rather

2811
01:50:39,329 --> 01:50:43,050
have those six or eight people sitting

2812
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:47,850
around trimming all day every day than

2813
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:49,680
two honestly so [ __ ] Auto trimmer

2814
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:53,100
[ __ ] trim machine trim it by hand

2815
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:56,179

2820
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:17,310
that question that somebody emailed to

2821
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,780
me the second half of that question is

2822
01:51:17,310 --> 01:51:20,039
kind of lengthy and I'm gonna have to do

2823
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:23,250
some research and give you a more

2824
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:25,590
thought-out answer for that for that

2825
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:27,029

in frozen something lit up inside of him

2848

2861

01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:47,920
that I upload so that it's more

2873
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,810
available for stitcher because people

2874
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,730
were downloading it so much that it was

2875
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:52,360
slowing down the stitcher application on

2876
01:53:51,729 --> 01:53:54,279
their phone

2877
01:53:52,359 --> 01:53:55,569
oh sure so I changed the file the type

2878
01:53:54,279 --> 01:53:57,130
to the type of file that I upload it's a

2879
01:53:55,569 --> 01:53:58,989
little smaller it doesn't sound as good

2880
01:53:57,130 --> 01:54:00,640
but nobody's probably gonna notice it's

2881
01:53:58,989 --> 01:54:03,000
just a voice podcast it's not like we're

2882
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:05,320
putting out dance music or anything so

2883
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,479
but yeah people are listening and I

2884
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:09,189
really really appreciate it told a

2885
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:12,579

2886

2887
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:17,289
about this because I was like no this

2888
01:54:15,579 --> 01:54:18,939
way I was really funny on this thing I

2889
01:54:17,289 --> 01:54:21,010
thought I was really funny back quite

2890
01:54:18,939 --> 01:54:21,779
geez I've been on this thing like eight

2891
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:27,159
times

2892
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:29,469
we're [ __ ] this is my favorite did

2893
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:31,599
you crash the [ __ ] intro - no no no

2894
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:33,250

2895
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,510
fun this is great man you look

2896
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:36,649
comfortable you finally got your head

2897
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:39,650
bobbing

2898
01:54:36,649 --> 01:54:41,389
good man no I just it is nice but it's

2899
01:54:39,649 --> 01:54:43,189
nice to tell one friend and then they

2900
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:45,230
tell one friend and then they tell when

2901
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:47,119
friends that's all I'm askin is tell

2902
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:52,759
your friend about Sam talent tell your

2903
01:54:47,119 --> 01:55:12,500
friends about coming down to do the

2904
01:54:52,760 --> 01:55:13,940
podcast if you want to [ __ ] ramble on

2905
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,829
about something for a couple of minutes

2906
01:55:13,939 --> 01:55:17,869
men whoops you're long how long have we

2907
01:55:15,829 --> 01:55:20,029
done no we've gone 33 minutes but I

2908
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:21,439
imagine that one to three minutes will

2909
01:55:20,029 --> 01:55:22,960
be taken out so we got about thirty

2910
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:25,488
minutes

2911
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:27,500
there was a depressing part there too I

2912
01:55:25,488 --> 01:55:29,089
hope that does not make the podcast

2913
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:30,859
Jesus I'll make you look dignified

2914
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,360
before this comes out that'd be really

2915
01:55:30,859 --> 01:55:34,639
funny of like just during that part you

2916
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:36,799
go Clint wants you to come out to to the

2917
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:48,469
to the show and like you just edit that

2918
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:53,090
in my shoulder I'm gonna try to take

2919
01:55:48,469 --> 01:55:56,658
that out of the recording the producer

2920
01:55:53,090 --> 01:56:00,610
in me absolutely bothers that's good I'm

2921
01:55:56,658 --> 01:56:00,609
glad you got such a talent for this

2922
01:56:02,529 --> 01:56:07,009
episode on this show and then I did

2923
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:08,810
about 50 on another show so I've had a

2924
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:13,130
little bit of practice and I think I

2925
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:14,510
finally got it figured out the

2926
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:16,039
improvements that I've done a lot of

2927
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:17,659
people have actually said that they've

2928
01:56:16,039 --> 01:56:19,369
gone back and listened from episode

2929
01:56:17,658 --> 01:56:21,439
number one up to whatever the current

2930
01:56:19,369 --> 01:56:23,359
episode is yeah and part of me makes my

2931
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:25,488
hang my head makes me hang my head in

2932
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:27,679
shame like oh you heard episodes one

2933
01:56:25,488 --> 01:56:31,609
through five where I was like not sure

2934
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:34,399
what I was doing at all but I'm like oh

2935
01:56:31,609 --> 01:56:36,500
but that means you also heard 75 where I

2936
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,389
knew everything that I was doing by now

2937
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:39,590
everything about a podcast but I feel

2938
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:41,480
like I can come on here and do a show

2939
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:42,920
now before it would take me three hours

2940
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:45,109
worth of getting stuff together and

2941
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:46,430
being nervous and three different takes

2942
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:48,769
of putting the show together

2943
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:49,760
Podcast time let's kill it see that's

2944
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:51,380
[ __ ] cool man

2945
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,820
that's neat then then I'll bet those

2946
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:54,140
people that have listened to all of them

2947
01:56:52,819 --> 01:56:56,269
to like feel like they know you pretty

2948
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:57,470
well and it's fun meeting those people

2949
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:58,670
because some people come out of nowhere

2950
01:56:57,470 --> 01:57:00,369
and they're like dude your roster

2951
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:06,789
they'll hear my voice at the gross store

2952
01:57:00,369 --> 01:57:06,789
you're the podcast recognize your voice

2953
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:14,539
no but that's kind of what I'm saying

2954
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:34,159
it's view if you listen let us know dude

2955
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:36,380
we're just human that's right I will

2956
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:39,289
I'll be like a dad give you looking at

2957
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:41,840

2958
01:57:39,289 --> 01:57:43,430
brought Jeb's dad in some dark glasses

2959
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,319

2962
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:53,900
the hair for the 70s I wasn't gonna

2963
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:58,840
mention your feathered 70s hair what's

2964
01:57:53,899 --> 01:58:01,489
with that I got a couple of things going

2965
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:11,150
way way off topic that was fun would be

2966
01:58:01,489 --> 01:58:24,920
your porn name Peter Frampton that'd be

2967
01:58:11,149 --> 01:58:26,089
[ __ ] fun underscore cuz then that's a

2968
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:33,310
pain in the ass and then you can't get

2969
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:36,739
the Twitter handle cuz it's too long I

2970
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:38,150
do I like [ __ ] Peter Frampton oh that

2971
01:58:36,739 --> 01:58:41,389
would be great uh but it sell some porn

2972
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:44,769
still maybe the next one I'm Bret

2973
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:46,690
Michaels and then comes alive Oh God

2974
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:48,580
[Music]

the Clint for coming on the show and

2980
01:58:55,329 --> 01:59:00,760
getting way too high that was the answer

2981
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:03,159
your question is just don't get too high

2982
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,449
and do a podcast yeah don't be recorded

2983
01:59:03,159 --> 01:59:17,710
while you're super high because you may

2984
01:59:04,449 --> 01:59:19,359
say some [ __ ] that you regret but you

2985
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:21,520
can get on your phone either your iPhone

2986
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:24,059

2987
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:27,370

right here that's so much on periscope

3016

3018
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:35,239
just send that on the podcast cuz now

3019
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:37,980
they want to challenge my troll game

3020
02:00:35,238 --> 02:00:40,769

there's a lot of jokes had been done

3026

to do a whole bunch of technical formal

3189
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:01,600
introductions let's get right down to it

3190
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:03,550
we all wanted Jesse to come on the show

3191
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:06,219
and do another grow lesson for us

3192
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:09,880
because it's outdoor season we know that

3193
02:13:06,219 --> 02:13:11,710
drawing outdoor is almost free some

3194
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:14,050
people asked me kind of about doing a

3195
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:16,899
budget episode like if they don't have a

3196
02:13:14,050 --> 02:13:18,670
lot of money so I figured we'll work on

3197
02:13:16,899 --> 02:13:20,889
getting the basics of an outdoor grow

3198
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:22,630
going and then maybe if we have some

3199
02:13:20,890 --> 02:13:24,789
extra time we will talk about maybe how

3200
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:26,050
to do a budget grow so we people don't

3201
02:13:24,789 --> 02:13:27,429
have to break the bank to build their

3202
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:30,760
grow and grow a whole bunch of ganja

3203
02:13:27,429 --> 02:13:31,929
okay oh yeah oh yeah we have some ideas

3204
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:33,820
Jesse and I have been at this for a

3205
02:13:31,929 --> 02:13:48,010
minute I bet we could build a hoop house

3206
02:13:33,819 --> 02:13:50,139
together in probably two hours you may

3207
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:52,989
have to adjust a lot of what we say for

3208
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:54,610
your area if you're in California you

3209
02:13:52,988 --> 02:13:56,349
may be a little bit earlier than us if

3210
02:13:54,609 --> 02:14:02,079
you're on the East Coast it's gonna be a

3211
02:13:56,350 --> 02:14:04,120
whole different story a lot more

3212
02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:06,819
humidity the scheduling is a lot more

3213
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:09,880
wonky the weather comes Midwest is

3214
02:14:06,819 --> 02:14:13,149
pretty similar to us just a lot easier

3215
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:15,069
for him so all right we'll get most of

3216
02:14:13,149 --> 02:14:16,539
this stuff based on Colorado grows but

3217
02:14:15,069 --> 02:14:19,029
we'll try to get it to where everybody

3218
02:14:16,539 --> 02:14:21,399
can work with this so I guess the first

3219
02:14:19,029 --> 02:14:23,649
question we should start with is where

3220
02:14:21,399 --> 02:14:25,238
where should we start growing where

3221
02:14:23,649 --> 02:14:27,989
should we look at growing our outdoor

3222
02:14:25,238 --> 02:14:32,219
crop or would be our ideal space

3223
02:14:27,989 --> 02:14:37,340
you want a south-facing you know get a

3224
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:41,070
good set southern view for the Sun

3225
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:43,170
starting this one off false to come at

3226
02:14:41,069 --> 02:14:46,789
you eventually and I can edit some stuff

3227
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:50,909
for sure no no need for that you want

3228
02:14:46,789 --> 02:14:53,760
you know probably six hours a day direct

3229
02:14:50,909 --> 02:14:59,159
sunlight every no girl unless but you

3230
02:14:53,760 --> 02:15:03,150
know for proper you want six plus big

3231
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:06,420
fat yeah okay I'd prefer like ten hours

3232
02:15:03,149 --> 02:15:10,369
a day personally but I mean can make it

3233
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:13,440
work outdoors is really forgiving so

3234
02:15:10,369 --> 02:15:16,109
they'll grow anywhere yeah well they'll

3235
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:19,619
grow an accident sometimes so you want a

3236
02:15:16,109 --> 02:15:21,269
south-facing slope if you can what if

3237
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:22,500
we're stuck like in the city what if

3238
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:26,520
we're in the backyard do we want to

3239
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:29,010
avoid some sheds streetlights if you can

3240
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:31,650
streetlights most of my sheds you know

3241
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:34,560
you don't want get too blocked in and

3242
02:15:31,649 --> 02:15:37,409
that is mainly for airflow I mean if

3243
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:39,060
your areas you know if like in the

3244
02:15:37,409 --> 02:15:41,939
middle of four sheds or set like that

3245
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:44,580
I'll stack together but it's twenty by

3246
02:15:41,939 --> 02:15:45,479
twenty you know you got any airflow that

3247
02:15:44,579 --> 02:15:48,149
for a compliment

3248
02:15:45,479 --> 02:15:49,829
leave some space if you know if it's

3249
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:52,500
like a six by six pot you know that's

3250
02:15:49,829 --> 02:15:54,750
enough for one plant baby right so you

3251
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:56,279
guys your plants are going to get big if

3252
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:57,479
you do this right and we'll talk about

3253
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:00,539
that in a few minutes when we talk about

3254
02:15:57,479 --> 02:16:02,669
container size so you would like a

3255
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:04,649
southern facing slope if you're gonna

3256
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:06,359
grow in your backyard or something don't

3257
02:16:04,649 --> 02:16:07,769
grow between the garage and the house

3258
02:16:06,359 --> 02:16:10,710
and the shed unless you can get plenty

3259
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:12,030
of error air flowing through there it's

3260
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:14,699
gonna be a great show Jesse's too high

3261
02:16:12,029 --> 02:16:16,109
in my throat salty wonderful make sure

3262
02:16:14,699 --> 02:16:17,519
you get plenty of airflow you don't want

3263
02:16:16,109 --> 02:16:19,259
your plants touching each other so when

3264
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:21,570
you do plant them make sure you give

3265
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:23,010
like expect the plants to be six to

3266
02:16:21,569 --> 02:16:24,420
eight feet around each by the time

3267
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:25,619
you're done maybe a little bit bigger if

3268
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:27,899
you're a good grower and you know what

3269
02:16:25,619 --> 02:16:30,479
you're doing yeah so expecting a big

3270
02:16:27,899 --> 02:16:32,520
plant give yourself plenty of room it's

3271
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:34,529
kind of what I was headed toward so we

3272
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:37,409
might be behind on this question but

3273
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:39,610
here in Colorado when should we put our

3274
02:16:37,409 --> 02:16:47,030
plants outside

3275
02:16:39,610 --> 02:17:01,590
[Music]

3276
02:16:47,030 --> 02:17:07,190
you know we've been getting for two

3277
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:07,190
weeks we deal with torrential hailstorm

3278
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:16,850
[Music]

3279
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:55,079
that actually over each previous episode

3280
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:57,300
but we should cannery rewind on that

3281
02:17:55,079 --> 02:17:59,968
when we can last year totally got [ __ ]

3282
02:17:57,299 --> 02:18:01,529
up by hell though see it is very

3283
02:17:59,968 --> 02:18:03,808
possible so you guys you're gonna [ __ ]

3284
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:05,340
some [ __ ] up don't be afraid like shit's

3285
02:18:03,808 --> 02:18:07,558
gonna go wrong but you always get next

3286
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:11,010
year oh yeah and you'll you'll salvage

3287
02:18:07,558 --> 02:18:13,949
something out of your harvest this yeah

3288
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:16,069
you almost always get something thieves

3289
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:18,329
or cops

3290
02:18:16,069 --> 02:18:20,069
that's funny because I've got the word

3291
02:18:18,329 --> 02:18:21,629
thieves and cops written on a note later

3292
02:18:20,069 --> 02:18:22,799
on in this I'm glad we're on the same

3293
02:18:21,629 --> 02:18:26,388
page here this is awesome

3294
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:29,609
so so we've got a few plants in a

3295
02:18:26,388 --> 02:18:33,239
ideally ideally you would be on a field

3296
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:36,800
in Humboldt County or somewhere out and

3297
02:18:33,239 --> 02:18:39,090
ride on a south-facing slope with a big

3298
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:42,420
18-foot tall chain-link fence where

3299
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:45,179
nobody can get in but that's not always

3300
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:46,950
for you we're gonna want these plants

3301
02:18:45,179 --> 02:18:48,030
with plenty of space between them you're

3302
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:49,440
gonna want them outside you're gonna

3303
02:18:48,030 --> 02:18:51,329
have to think about this weather I'm

3304
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:52,230
kind of skipping ahead but Jesse said

3305
02:18:51,329 --> 02:18:53,610
you can put them out now

3306
02:18:52,229 --> 02:18:55,829
I thought about all the weather we've

3307
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:57,390
been getting let's let's just go right

3308
02:18:55,829 --> 02:19:00,059
to the hoop house let's talk about that

3309
02:18:57,389 --> 02:19:02,399
it seems to be the ideal outdoor if

3310
02:19:00,059 --> 02:19:04,019
people want to go outdoors cheap to

3311
02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:07,979
protect everything I think a hoop house

3312
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:11,970
might be yeah that's not so the best way

3313
02:19:07,979 --> 02:19:15,750
to get the best prison look at reduction

3314
02:19:11,969 --> 02:19:18,389
in my opinion okay I'll just straight up

3315
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:19,649
outdoor tends to get dirty if you're

3316
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:23,180
making concentrates you're gonna make

3317
02:19:19,649 --> 02:19:26,130
just concentrate beaten by the Sun

3318
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:29,550
rained on you know all that good stuff

3319
02:19:26,130 --> 02:19:30,989
that a simple hoop house covering can

3320
02:19:29,550 --> 02:19:34,591
save you a lot of headaches it can

3321
02:19:30,989 --> 02:19:37,110
create a couple - as long as it's tall

3322
02:19:34,591 --> 02:19:39,211
enough you know realized this stranger

3323
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:41,489
here go and do a little research figure

3324
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:43,319
out how much you're gonna stretch or if

3325
02:19:41,489 --> 02:19:47,880
you've done this before you know feel

3326
02:19:43,319 --> 02:19:49,380
you know what's up yeah so plan for that

3327
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:53,579
they're gonna get big outside yeah a

3328
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:55,439
plant plan for the size and make sure

3329
02:19:53,579 --> 02:19:59,521
you have plenty airflow at the top as a

3330
02:19:55,440 --> 02:20:01,681
greenhouse and at the bottom fresh air

3331
02:19:59,521 --> 02:20:03,360
in an old stale air out yes it's just as

3332
02:20:01,681 --> 02:20:04,980
important as in the grow and the humid

3333
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:07,560
air - that's because the plants are

3334
02:20:04,979 --> 02:20:10,800
transpiring telling the plastic traps

3335
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:13,860
the water in there so that's you got to

3336
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:15,869
get that out of there alright so what's

3337
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:18,841
up real quickly if you could describe to

3338
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:20,341
me how to build a you know just a hoop

3339
02:20:18,841 --> 02:20:21,899
house that would fit in my backyard you

3340
02:20:20,341 --> 02:20:25,409
know maybe just like a 10 by 20 at the

3341
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:26,609
biggest yeah the most two or three

3342
02:20:25,409 --> 02:20:30,110
minutes worth of how to build a hoop

3343
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:30,110
house for sure real simple

3344
02:20:30,601 --> 02:20:36,851
I've tried to take how simple three

3345
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:40,899
start with the frame okay all right so

3346
02:20:36,851 --> 02:20:45,400
take like what size did you say 10 by 20

3347
02:20:40,899 --> 02:20:47,109
10 by 20 get to 20 uh so you'll need 40

3348
02:20:45,399 --> 02:20:51,460
foot of lumber there or 30 foot of

3349
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:55,391
lumber there oh I just don't yeah 60

3350
02:20:51,460 --> 02:21:02,409
fine there you go but I get I forgot to

3351
02:20:55,390 --> 02:21:06,190
carry the two so build your frame just

3352
02:21:02,409 --> 02:21:07,750
like a big box secure it to the ground

3353
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:14,890
you don't even have to secure it to the

3354
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:18,190
ground but it'll help and inside that

3355
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:20,079
frame just bend your PVC tubes you know

3356
02:21:18,190 --> 02:21:23,801
you just like probably 20 foot tube or

3357
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:26,829
so like a 20 foot stick on that and you

3358
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:28,750
know that's gonna NGO puts I think

3359
02:21:26,829 --> 02:21:32,140
somewhere around a 7 foot ceiling I want

3360
02:21:28,750 --> 02:21:36,190
to say I'm not sure on that though but

3361
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:38,350
uh and then just continue down you know

3362
02:21:36,190 --> 02:21:42,390
this over a 20 foot span you'd probably

3363
02:21:38,351 --> 02:21:45,700
want I'd I'd recommend at least 7

3364
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:47,440
probably go for more like 8 or 9 so what

3365
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:49,211
we're doing he's so you've got a rec

3366
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:50,950
tube set you're gonna rectangle it's a

3367
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:52,449
10 by 20 and then what we're gonna do

3368
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:54,971
why we call it a hoop house we're taking

3369
02:21:52,450 --> 02:21:56,500
PVC tubing and it almost looks like

3370
02:21:54,970 --> 02:21:59,199
you're just using hoops and building

3371
02:21:56,500 --> 02:22:01,271
along too but you make an arch from and

3372
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:03,579
we're doing it the 10 foot to 10 foot

3373
02:22:01,271 --> 02:22:05,829
side not the 20 inch or the 20 foot so

3374
02:22:03,579 --> 02:22:07,360
you go from 110 to trolley you just make

3375
02:22:05,829 --> 02:22:09,220
an arch and that way it makes it about 7

3376
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:11,921
feet tall and then it's 10 feet wide and

3377
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:14,109
then you do those about every 2 or 3 3

3378
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:19,931
or 4 feet yeah depending on how much

3379
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:21,971
wind I he you know here in the Prairie

3380
02:22:19,931 --> 02:22:24,671
in southern Colorado I'd probably

3381
02:22:21,970 --> 02:22:26,939
recommend it 3 foot all right so it's

3382
02:22:24,671 --> 02:22:31,479
about every 3 feet put a put another PVC

3383
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:33,940
tube and attach that to the box somehow

3384
02:22:31,479 --> 02:22:36,699
to your business what do you use to

3385
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:38,230
attach it like a conduit clamp perfectly

3386
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:41,300
that's what I yeah and then I also run a

3387
02:22:38,229 --> 02:23:24,250
lag bolt to there only one run one

3388
02:22:41,299 --> 02:23:24,250
and I'd actually recommend three okay

3389
02:23:30,850 --> 02:23:40,818
that feels pretty secure how do you

3390
02:23:33,559 --> 02:23:43,908
attach that top whole fence most as the

3391
02:23:40,818 --> 02:23:47,448
easiest way just big of a fence post at

3392
02:23:43,908 --> 02:23:49,639
the end of each end of the greenhouse on

3393
02:23:47,449 --> 02:23:54,260
a 20-foot one you might want one in the

3394
02:23:49,639 --> 02:23:56,059
middle too and just arrange the size so

3395
02:23:54,260 --> 02:23:59,988
that it meets up with that skeleton beam

3396
02:23:56,059 --> 02:24:02,389
and fasten it to width or conduit clamps

3397
02:23:59,988 --> 02:24:08,270
okay sounds like you've done this

3398
02:24:02,389 --> 02:24:09,920
several dozen times yes we've got the

3399
02:24:08,270 --> 02:24:12,109
skeleton figured out basically right

3400
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:17,238
yeah all right no how do we what do we

3401
02:24:12,109 --> 02:24:22,789
use for a cover beautiful plants it

3402
02:24:17,238 --> 02:24:28,879
depends on your budget if if you're you

3403
02:24:22,789 --> 02:24:31,010
know low in budget of this Queen or just

3404
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:35,750
poly plastic from Lowe's works great

3405
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:38,600
I get the heavier thicker mail and you

3406
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:40,818
know if you got a better budget which we

3407
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:43,550
sell greenhouse fabrics lots of places

3408
02:24:40,818 --> 02:24:46,579
so greenhouse fabrics so

3409
02:24:43,549 --> 02:24:49,819
and it ranges you know first I want to

3410
02:24:46,579 --> 02:24:51,289
say it so where hell I don't even know I

3411
02:24:49,819 --> 02:24:53,899
know it goes up to like 10 bucks a

3412
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:56,420
square foot so I mean it starts off way

3413
02:24:53,899 --> 02:24:58,459
cheaper than that okay that is high yeah

3414
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:59,659
yeah so you guys you can afford this if

3415
02:24:58,459 --> 02:25:04,159
you guys work a little bit through the

3416
02:24:59,659 --> 02:25:08,559
winter you can build this next summer so

3417
02:25:04,159 --> 02:25:08,559
we covered up how do you secure the

3418
02:25:10,299 --> 02:25:24,549
weather they call it looks like a

3419
02:25:15,079 --> 02:25:24,549
battery jumper cable clamp oh yeah we

3420
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:35,829
[Music]

3421
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,829
get them for like 250 at Harbor Freight

3422
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:39,259
[Music]

3423
02:25:42,399 --> 02:25:48,199
[Music]

3424
02:25:45,069 --> 02:25:59,090
you should put a fan in the top in one

3425
02:25:48,200 --> 02:26:01,430
of the peaks that's even cooler those

3426
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:03,530
work great on the ground do one coming

3427
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:06,860
in uh yeah one thing that sucks about

3428
02:26:03,530 --> 02:26:08,540
those is though they suck up rocks and a

3429
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:11,510
lot of them have plastic blades in them

3430
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:14,170
so take you a piece of ducting that's I

3431
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:16,159
don't know like three foot long and

3432
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:18,379
secure to the side of the greenhouse

3433
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:20,690
lift it up a little bit higher attach it

3434
02:26:18,379 --> 02:26:24,949
to the fan so that it can't suck any

3435
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:37,489
rocks off yeah I know what that sounds

3436
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:40,159
like greenhouse that question right

3437
02:26:37,489 --> 02:26:42,110
there what kind of soil should we use um

3438
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:42,889
that depends on your budget and just

3439
02:26:42,110 --> 02:26:44,569
your gross tile

3440
02:26:42,889 --> 02:26:46,159
oh really I mean should we put them

3441
02:26:44,569 --> 02:26:48,728
straight into the dirty sink or should

3442
02:26:46,159 --> 02:26:48,728
we use pots

3443
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:55,110
it you know it also depends on your

3444
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:57,630
location I would tend to recommend pots

3445
02:26:55,110 --> 02:27:00,979
even though I would rather be able to

3446
02:26:57,629 --> 02:27:04,319
recommend platinum in the ground but

3447
02:27:00,978 --> 02:27:07,889
there's a little more to that if you go

3448
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:12,299
get like a 30 gallon smart pop outdoors

3449
02:27:07,889 --> 02:27:14,369
I recommend the fabric pots and they

3450
02:27:12,299 --> 02:27:17,728
sell the tamerlan's now too which are

3451
02:27:14,370 --> 02:27:19,680
great because they reflect heat a little

3452
02:27:17,728 --> 02:27:23,699
better than the black ones that tend to

3453
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:24,930
absorb heat but you know I mean if you

3454
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:28,110
just went with your favorite potting

3455
02:27:24,930 --> 02:27:29,639
soil um just you know I recommend

3456
02:27:28,110 --> 02:27:31,800
probably going three times bigger than

3457
02:27:29,639 --> 02:27:35,189
your typical indoor container okay a

3458
02:27:31,799 --> 02:27:37,139
large container large containers stick

3459
02:27:35,189 --> 02:27:38,370
with your regular nutrient schedule you

3460
02:27:37,139 --> 02:27:38,909
know stick with what you're comfortable

3461
02:27:38,370 --> 02:27:42,120
with

3462
02:27:38,909 --> 02:27:44,039
um you know if you want to do organics

3463
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:46,140
that I could spend a whole episode on

3464
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:48,120
talking about there are some episodes

3465
02:27:46,139 --> 02:27:49,469
with Sean you guys are all about

3466
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:51,329
amending soil and they're a great

3467
02:27:49,469 --> 02:27:54,599
outdoor mixes in there and I mean that's

3468
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:56,728
personally the way I grow half of my

3469
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:58,260
plate I mean we do six plants in the

3470
02:27:56,728 --> 02:28:00,779
ground we do six plants in there like

3471
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:03,600
depth greenhouse the ones in the ground

3472
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:06,659
have been enough I've been grown in that

3473
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:10,680
soil for eight years now the ones in the

3474
02:28:06,659 --> 02:28:13,939
greenhouse get my homemade mixture which

3475
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:18,360
is real similar to I don't know fruits

3476
02:28:13,939 --> 02:28:20,130
roots are yeah and they get the you know

3477
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:22,319
personally I grow organic so they get

3478
02:28:20,129 --> 02:28:24,629
teased and I've been playing around with

3479
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:28,379
for rents and stuff like that but don't

3480
02:28:24,629 --> 02:28:30,089
they London iced tea if you feed him an

3481
02:28:28,379 --> 02:28:33,509
iced tea those plants take on especially

3482
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:35,250
with the coffee juice yeah all right so

3483
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:37,800
we've got these plants in a nice Kashi

3484
02:28:35,250 --> 02:28:39,780
juice oh yeah I could go off on a whole

3485
02:28:37,799 --> 02:28:55,879
rant about that no one it almost flew

3486
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:55,880
over my head you have all kinds of names

3487
02:28:56,420 --> 02:29:02,750
[Music]

3488
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,370
yeah yeah alright so we've got this nice

3489
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:06,319
little light depth greenhouse we've got

3490
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:10,730
some plants in really large pots or not

3491
02:29:06,319 --> 02:29:11,989
like this episode we may discuss that a

3492
02:29:10,729 --> 02:29:17,119
little more in the future we've done it

3493
02:29:11,989 --> 02:29:26,930
once it's you put the plastic on you

3494
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:29,600
take it off you could teach anyone to do

3495
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:33,940
it and we talked about it in a past

3496
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:36,500
episode over that one in the future also

3497
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:39,610
this little hoop house you've got large

3498
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:41,690
pots with decent soil here feeding

3499
02:29:39,610 --> 02:29:43,810
nutrients that you're familiar with or a

3500
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:46,521
bottled nutrient line because that's

3501
02:29:43,809 --> 02:29:48,559
probably cost-effective if not our

3502
02:29:46,521 --> 02:29:50,810
friend Sean will teach you a great soil

3503
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:51,799
recipe I'll find the episode number and

3504
02:29:50,809 --> 02:29:54,590
insert that in the notes

3505
02:29:51,799 --> 02:29:58,069
um outdoor plants tend to use a little

3506
02:29:54,590 --> 02:30:00,620
more food food okay when I've grown

3507
02:29:58,069 --> 02:30:02,869
bottled nutrients outdoors we normally

3508
02:30:00,620 --> 02:30:05,600
feed to the top end of the

3509
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:09,410
recommendation if maybe even just a

3510
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:24,440
little over this was with gin or organic

3511
02:30:09,409 --> 02:30:35,600
specifically what kind of lights to use

3512
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:39,350
and I was like kavita's alright should

3513
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:41,479
we expect to see signs of flour late

3514
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:43,159
July early August in southern Colorado

3515
02:30:41,479 --> 02:30:47,809
depends on what strange we're working

3516
02:30:43,159 --> 02:30:50,149
with that to indicas seem to ten there I

3517
02:30:47,809 --> 02:30:52,039
would say in my experience indicas get a

3518
02:30:50,149 --> 02:30:58,219
little quicker around here so very true

3519
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:59,370
the float spits out pistols Mike alex is

3520
02:30:58,219 --> 02:31:03,619
my government

3521
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:05,340
just kills it outdoors like that's

3522
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:07,800
alright

3523
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:08,851
so speaking of mules I'm just joking how

3524
02:31:07,799 --> 02:31:10,199
that is kind of good though what kind of

3525
02:31:08,851 --> 02:31:14,851
problems do you think well we should

3526
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:19,079
tell the people to be prepared for we

3527
02:31:14,851 --> 02:31:26,640
get those damn little moths they lay

3528
02:31:19,079 --> 02:31:29,659
eggs yeah and they pour into your bud if

3529
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:34,049
you do a light dip and it's early season

3530
02:31:29,659 --> 02:31:40,280
yeah watch out for moulds wood rot stuff

3531
02:31:34,049 --> 02:31:44,819
like is that something that happened

3532
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:48,500
mold I mean wicked spin well I've had

3533
02:31:44,819 --> 02:31:48,500
enough PMS of a bastard

3534
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:54,479
I mean I personally don't think you know

3535
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:56,399
a little on a fan leaf here there right

3536
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:58,709
before her wrist is one thing it fits on

3537
02:31:56,399 --> 02:32:01,979
the bud it's done in my opinion every

3538
02:31:58,709 --> 02:32:07,079
bud rot I have just seen that for the

3539
02:32:01,979 --> 02:32:09,629
first time this year ever and it was it

3540
02:32:07,079 --> 02:32:13,680
was in another light dip they didn't

3541
02:32:09,629 --> 02:32:16,229
have kids our circulation guys get that

3542
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:20,310
stimulation up we always had a very

3543
02:32:16,229 --> 02:32:22,409
grainy spring and lots of the hell and

3544
02:32:20,310 --> 02:32:24,569
everything is just the humidity has been

3545
02:32:22,409 --> 02:32:27,869
so much higher than a lot of outdoor

3546
02:32:24,569 --> 02:32:29,851
growers are used to dealing with around

3547
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:31,470
here yeah so and we're using swamp

3548
02:32:29,851 --> 02:32:34,771
coolers to try to call the house on top

3549
02:32:31,469 --> 02:32:37,439
of that his loss or his harvest was by

3550
02:32:34,771 --> 02:32:40,470
no means a total loss you know he

3551
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:42,870
probably lost the plant needs a combined

3552
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:49,469
out of I think he did 12 plants in there

3553
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:51,510
so like that okay that's not it's not

3554
02:32:49,469 --> 02:32:53,520
like it was p.m. where you're like you

3555
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:55,771
can smell it on buds that weren't even

3556
02:32:53,521 --> 02:33:04,680
affected and stuff like like or at least

3557
02:32:55,771 --> 02:33:08,010
what I've seen so far you know depends

3558
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:11,109
on where you live deer love it cows love

3559
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:13,540
it every everything that eats

3560
02:33:11,109 --> 02:33:18,970
who loves it um especially when it's

3561
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:20,680
well cared for so if you know you know

3562
02:33:18,969 --> 02:33:23,429
just prepare for the animals in your

3563
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:26,380
area even cats and that's gonna say cats

3564
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:27,939
squirrels all the domestic [ __ ] pest

3565
02:33:26,379 --> 02:33:30,129
animals are gonna come at it too so be

3566
02:33:27,939 --> 02:33:31,540
prepared somehow like you gotta section

3567
02:33:30,129 --> 02:33:32,139
it off somehow so these animals don't

3568
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:36,069
get to it

3569
02:33:32,139 --> 02:33:37,269
should we treat for bugs outdoors my you

3570
02:33:36,068 --> 02:33:39,309
can correct me if I'm wrong here the

3571
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:40,720
outdoor guy I feel like if we don't [ __ ]

3572
02:33:39,309 --> 02:33:42,398
with nature nature will kind of take

3573
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:44,529
care of itself for us like I feel like

3574
02:33:42,398 --> 02:33:46,898
if I spray I'm gonna upset the whole

3575
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:49,060
system and a bug that wouldn't normally

3576
02:33:46,898 --> 02:33:50,289
dominate will dominate because whatever

3577
02:33:49,059 --> 02:33:52,510
should have been there to eat it will be

3578
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:54,390
gone is that kind of right and like

3579
02:33:52,510 --> 02:33:59,139
where I grow I totally agree with that

3580
02:33:54,389 --> 02:34:04,809
we use very minimal pesticides very

3581
02:33:59,139 --> 02:34:06,309
strategic timing in a greenhouse you

3582
02:34:04,809 --> 02:34:08,949
know depends on how sealed up your

3583
02:34:06,309 --> 02:34:12,579
greenhouse is a lot of times it's just

3584
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:14,520
like a girl rumen jogger man um so just

3585
02:34:12,579 --> 02:34:19,568
don't overdo it

3586
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:22,540
you know as it is a lot harder to fur in

3587
02:34:19,568 --> 02:34:25,239
insects and parasites to survive outside

3588
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:27,939
I mean it's the best grow room in the

3589
02:34:25,239 --> 02:34:29,889
world it's it's got perfect airflow and

3590
02:34:27,939 --> 02:34:32,620
everything he's know and in this anyo

3591
02:34:29,889 --> 02:34:35,949
as long as the plants are happy aren't

3592
02:34:32,620 --> 02:34:37,600
dressed out you know I think a zmax

3593
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:39,220
probably the strongest thing I've ever

3594
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:42,430
used outdoors how do you feel about

3595
02:34:39,219 --> 02:34:43,809
spinosad that's great stuff that's

3596
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:45,939
something you can do to go after the

3597
02:34:43,809 --> 02:34:48,279
moths and stuff like that yeah that's a

3598
02:34:45,939 --> 02:34:50,559
something I mean we have bees on our

3599
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:53,950
property too so that's a you know always

3600
02:34:50,559 --> 02:34:56,379
a consideration but spinosad is

3601
02:34:53,950 --> 02:34:59,260
something that you know we don't really

3602
02:34:56,379 --> 02:35:01,688
worry about it all it's it's totally

3603
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:03,909
natural so Xperia T on the plants oh

3604
02:35:01,689 --> 02:35:05,979
gosh we do essentially we it derives

3605
02:35:03,909 --> 02:35:10,340
from a bacteria found in the bottle of a

3606
02:35:05,978 --> 02:35:14,909
rum jar there's the bottom of a rub jar

3607
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:16,500
[Music]

3608
02:35:14,909 --> 02:35:20,879
for sure I read that a long time ago

3609
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:22,680
somewhere all right Captain Jack's yeah

3610
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:24,539
Captain Jack's to the rescue sometimes

3611
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:26,250
so we talked about all the weather you

3612
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:27,930
guys be prepared for a lot of weather

3613
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:29,879
you're gonna get heat you're gonna get

3614
02:35:27,930 --> 02:35:32,398
hail you're gonna get rain you're gonna

3615
02:35:29,879 --> 02:35:34,859
get wind it's gonna be treacherous out

3616
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:36,029
there imagine being stuck outside all

3617
02:35:34,860 --> 02:35:37,319
the time and not being able to come

3618
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:39,239
inside you're gonna have to prepare for

3619
02:35:37,319 --> 02:35:41,789
your plants you need to build them in a

3620
02:35:39,239 --> 02:35:42,148
doghouse or something they need love all

3621
02:35:41,790 --> 02:35:43,620
right

3622
02:35:42,148 --> 02:35:45,539
also something I thought we should

3623
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:47,310
mention is be prepared for a lot of

3624
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:49,530
watering I don't know if you guys are

3625
02:35:47,309 --> 02:35:52,139
prepared or realize how much water your

3626
02:35:49,530 --> 02:35:53,760
outdoor plants are going to take how

3627
02:35:52,139 --> 02:35:59,069
often do you water your outdoor plants

3628
02:35:53,760 --> 02:36:02,250
Jesse well up until you know normally

3629
02:35:59,069 --> 02:36:03,059
it's once a day this year's been a

3630
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:05,189
little different

3631
02:36:03,059 --> 02:36:06,959
I haven't had to water as much you've

3632
02:36:05,189 --> 02:36:09,389
done a lot of rain it's actually been a

3633
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:11,369
pain in the [ __ ] ass like some of my

3634
02:36:09,389 --> 02:36:15,420
plants are severely stunted because of

3635
02:36:11,370 --> 02:36:17,189
it so don't catch up though yeah it'll

3636
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:22,829
dry out here pretty soon we'll be

3637
02:36:17,189 --> 02:36:24,720
missing that evening rain in the

3638
02:36:22,829 --> 02:36:26,250
flowering when they start budding out in

3639
02:36:24,719 --> 02:36:30,209
the summer are you gonna be watering

3640
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:33,719
them twice probably so in-ground plants

3641
02:36:30,209 --> 02:36:38,669
don't need to be watered as much if you

3642
02:36:33,719 --> 02:36:44,000
water them right you know 15 20 gallons

3643
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:48,030
at a time it's a workout when we do

3644
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:50,180
outdoor and ground water in the

3645
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:52,950
greenhouse I use the automated systems

3646
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:59,430
if I put those sprinklers and everything

3647
02:36:52,950 --> 02:37:03,030
and yeah yeah but that just tells you

3648
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:06,898
how much water you know even smart pots

3649
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:08,130
need outdoors the Sun just bakes those

3650
02:37:06,898 --> 02:37:10,198
pots

3651
02:37:08,129 --> 02:37:12,299
gotta lose your scent like that just

3652
02:37:10,199 --> 02:37:14,040
feel the side of one of their if you

3653
02:37:12,299 --> 02:37:18,209
know of a row spot or scent like that

3654
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:20,369
sitting outside and I mean this this one

3655
02:37:18,209 --> 02:37:23,278
just bakes it I guess so [ __ ] hot and

3656
02:37:20,369 --> 02:37:24,989
that gets your roots on which they can

3657
02:37:23,279 --> 02:37:27,420
survive they just need plenty of water

3658
02:37:24,988 --> 02:37:29,398
to be able to handle it okay

3659
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:31,590
also you said to put mulch on top of

3660
02:37:29,398 --> 02:37:34,978
your pots also yeah a little keep

3661
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:37,978
moisture in yeah yeah in ground or in

3662
02:37:34,978 --> 02:37:41,309
the pots another thing if you do have

3663
02:37:37,978 --> 02:37:43,318
black pots outside I recommend wrapping

3664
02:37:41,309 --> 02:37:45,629
them in panda plastic with the white

3665
02:37:43,318 --> 02:37:50,039
side out make them a little reflective

3666
02:37:45,629 --> 02:37:51,839
yeah all right I did that three start

3667
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:55,890
doing that through years ago it seemed

3668
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:58,079
to make a difference so what I'd like to

3669
02:37:55,889 --> 02:38:01,228
figure out for these people is some

3670
02:37:58,079 --> 02:38:03,270
no-till talk with Shawn some future

3671
02:38:01,228 --> 02:38:05,818
stuff about us so yeah no-till isn't

3672
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:08,189
even looking into that this year it was

3673
02:38:05,818 --> 02:38:10,889
kind of a last minute opportunity for so

3674
02:38:08,189 --> 02:38:12,389
once they got the required licensing and

3675
02:38:10,889 --> 02:38:18,778
everything they just went with what they

3676
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:20,189
had so which wasn't much all right

3677
02:38:18,779 --> 02:38:22,290
before my computer start stripping out

3678
02:38:20,189 --> 02:38:23,369
too much here do you have any tips for

3679
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:25,489
the people that are starting to grow

3680
02:38:23,369 --> 02:38:31,319
outdoors for their first time this year

3681
02:38:25,488 --> 02:38:33,180
water a lot if you're in ground just

3682
02:38:31,318 --> 02:38:36,618
make sure the waters soaking down into

3683
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:39,449
the soil once it start to pull it up

3684
02:38:36,619 --> 02:38:40,920
give it a minute you know see how long

3685
02:38:39,449 --> 02:38:42,720
it takes it for it to drain down into

3686
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:47,129
the soil that gives you a real good

3687
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:48,929
indication of how damp the soil is cuz

3688
02:38:47,129 --> 02:38:52,170
you know a container is easy you just

3689
02:38:48,930 --> 02:38:54,000
got to pick it up you know and you

3690
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:56,430
should be able to through

3691
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,079
trial-and-error figure out how how much

3692
02:38:56,430 --> 02:38:59,520
water to put in it how much it should

3693
02:38:58,079 --> 02:39:02,340
weigh how long how long it takes to dry

3694
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:06,600
um the the earth can be a little more

3695
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:09,568
challenging to aid in that water and put

3696
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:12,880
a frame around the clamp like a three

3697
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:14,139
foot by three foot two by four frame

3698
02:39:12,879 --> 02:39:19,000
just put it on the ground you can also

3699
02:39:14,139 --> 02:39:21,219
attach the big crazy of tomato cages or

3700
