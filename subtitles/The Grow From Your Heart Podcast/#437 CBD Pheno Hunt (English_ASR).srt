39
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,780
living in prohibition land and I haven't

40
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:08,758
grown in 15 years I absolutely love the

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,709

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,299
entertaining it is hey Thank You Man

43
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,930
I like the messages that start with

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,430
compliments so thanks a lot

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,859
recently I've had some traumatic

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,480
experiences that have given me extreme

47
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:23,530
general anxiety and have given me PTSD

48
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,199
honestly though I'm not concerned about

49
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,419
me I have a five year old son that we

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,339
see starting to have many many problems

51
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,848
with being on the spectrum with very

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,310
high-functioning autism and extreme ADHD

53
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:38,649
I want to avoid him being prescribed

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,650
harsh narcotics so I want to get him

55
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,599
into CBD I have recently been reading

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,688
about how CBD and how it could help my

57
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,479
son so I purchased some CBD tinctures

58
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:53,168
legally here in New York this has been a

59
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,658
miracle for my anxiety and my PTSD more

60
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,000
importantly it turns my son into a new

61
00:02:55,658 --> 00:03:00,009
kid that is great to hear sometimes when

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,269
you're purchasing CBD you're not exactly

63
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,968
sure what you're getting so I'm glad

64
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,980
you're getting a CBD ilegal CBD product

65
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:07,598
and I'm delighted to hear that it's

66
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:09,098
helping your son when it fixes the kids

67
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,048
that always feels a little better when

68
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:12,548
you heal an adult an adult feels better

69
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,069
that feels great but when you see a

70
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,260
little kid just better that just makes

71
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:18,128
everybody feel better movies with little

72
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,509
kids those are always more

73
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:21,098
heart-wrenching anything with a child

74
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:23,048
just feels better so I'm glad that your

75
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:24,310
son is able to be himself and you're

76
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,169
able to enjoy your son that's gonna

77
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,579
build a better relationship for both you

78
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,949
that'll make both your lives better so

79
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,799
we see CBD helping already this is a

80
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,540
great message it goes on to say my son's

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,379
teachers have asked me if he is on

82
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:40,150
adderall and I say nope just CBD I am

83
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:42,429
amazed and I now need to grow my own

84
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,979
medicine for myself and my son because I

85
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,189
can't afford these very expensive CBD

86
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,590
oils so my question is what strains

87
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:53,620
would you recommend I would like some

88
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,560
CBD only and then some one-to-one ratio

89
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,188
and I'm sure he means a 1 to 1 THC 1 to

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,769
1 CBD and then a very high THC strain

91
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:05,138
for myself and my fiance especially

92
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,389
since I'm risking it for my son anyway

93
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:10,139
but seriously if you know of any high

94
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:13,150
THC strains that will help with PTSD

95
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,099
please let me know I know you aren't an

96
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,168
expert on making extract so I'll get

97
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:19,418
that info elsewhere unless you have some

98
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,728
input I follow you want all social

99
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:23,288
medias since I haven't been able to

100
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,968
become a patron hey that's alright

101
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,259
thanks for the great message thanks for

102
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,079
following me on the social media you

103
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,430
don't have to become

104
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,680
patron for me to support you and help

105
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,840

106
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,939

107
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,239
bringing this community together people

108
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,530
like you are what's making this industry

109
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,930
legitimate and then he signs his message

110
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,848
and then it says PS been listening since

111
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,250
before I started growing again and

112
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:48,319
before your dude grows episode a true

113
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,348
fan of your kindness and voice I

114
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,180
seriously love the podcast a that's a

115
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:54,978
great message there is a lot of stuff to

116
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,590
cover let's back up a few steps and talk

117
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:59,418
about a couple of things I love and

118
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,508
respect the fact that you are stepping

119
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:05,448
up to produce medicine to make your son

120
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,979
and your entire family's life better but

121
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,319
you said earlier that you are in

122
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:13,579
prohibition land so one thing we need to

123
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,560
weigh here is the cost of your safety

124
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,810
you are producing medicine to make

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,870
yourself and your son's life better is

126
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,689
that worth the risk if you get caught

127
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,000
you may be removed from your son's life

128
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,769
for quite a long time there's another

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,439
personal part in this message I did not

130
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:32,628
read out loud imagine what would happen

131
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,949
if you were removed from your son it

132
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:35,569
would be in the hands of that other

133
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,550
person you mentioned that I did not read

134
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,770
about that may not be the best outcome

135
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,538
that may not be what you want so think

136
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:43,728
about that you need to weigh those

137
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:46,158
options yes I always say grow cannabis

138
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:48,978
do that you're an adult but in this case

139
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:50,838
your son needs you you may want to

140
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:53,628
consider your options here you do have

141
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:57,050
the option to get that teacher it is

142
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:59,330
expensive growing is expensive equipment

143
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,860
is expensive the processing is going to

144
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,838
take a lot of effort and a lot of

145
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,240
equipment and you could really screw it

146
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:07,038
up and waste an entire crop which means

147
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,110
you just risked your freedom and your

148
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,818
son's well-being for a crop that you

149
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,348
accidentally destroyed I'm not trying to

150
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,908
say you're gonna do this I'm just trying

151
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:16,128
to put some thought into your head so

152
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:18,319
you know very clearly what you're

153
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,338
risking and you know your options I just

154
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,449
want to make that clear for you it

155
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,860
sounds like you're gonna grow it sounds

156
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,740
like I probably can't sway you but I

157
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,770
want you to know that that teacher is

158
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,259
available at a cost there's money money

159
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:33,258
is expensive but freedom is priceless

160
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,479
and if you are not around to help your

161
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,479
son you are not around to help your son

162
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,829
at all so it really sounds like you've

163
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,069
got your heart set on growing cannabis

164
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,509
it sounds like you've already

165
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,969
some equivalent and you're gonna do it

166
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,009
so I will talk about some genetics that

167
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,690
would help you out but keep in mind if

168
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,789
there is tincture available that is

169
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,740
already processed and you can buy it and

170
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,900
it works and it did what you need done

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,360
and it is already showing positive

172
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,939
results I may stick to that if it is

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,470
illegal to grow in your area just that's

174
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,959
that's something that I would stick with

175
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,150
if it were me for the child safety

176
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,370
that's what I would do that's what I

177
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,919
should recommend I'm a cannabis grower

178
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,079
I'm a SI breeder I'm a cannabis advocate

179
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm a cannabis activists on the cannabis

180
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,879
spokesperson but before all of that I'm

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,710
a father and if you made me choose one

182
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,540
you wouldn't see me do any more cannabis

183
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,930
stuff you'd just see me focused on that

184
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,850
kid she's 16 she needs a good father I

185
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,740
understand how important it is for us to

186
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,790
be there so that may be something to

187
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,160
think about I'm just coming from my

188
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,420
fatherly side today is her birthday so

189
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,400
maybe it's weighing a little extra heavy

190
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,960
on me today but that is what I thought

191
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,669
of first of all now it sounds like

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,379
you're gonna grow so if you're gonna

193
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,759
grow if your heart is set on it or if

194
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,860
there's somebody else out there who may

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,349
want this information let's talk about

196
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,759
some CBD rich strains I'll try to touch

197
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,500
on some things that are known to be one

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,449
at one-to-one and then I will give some

199
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,790
recommendations for strains that I

200
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:58,079
believe are high THC and have worked

201
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,400
well in PTSD applications one thing that

202
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,319
pops into my head when I start thinking

203
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,109
about Fino hunting for CBD rich

204
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,029
phenotypes from a pack of seeds is lab

205
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,639
testing do you have lab testing

206
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,769
available you're going to hypothetically

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,529
acquire seeds and you will grow those

208
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:15,359
seeds the plants that come from those

209
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,069
seeds will have different traits the

210
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,990
buds that come from those plants will

211
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,029
have different medicinal qualities they

212
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,259
will have different cannabinoid profiles

213
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,329
they will have different terpene

214
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,730
profiles depending on the breeding

215
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:29,370
selections and the filial generation you

216
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,580
could have vastly different cannabinoid

217
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:36,120
profiles without lab testing there is no

218
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,000
way of knowing how much CBD or THC is in

219
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,860
each finished plant the only way you are

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,418
going to know which of those plants

221
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,550
works effectively for your son's

222
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,009
condition is to make a tincture out of

223
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:48,719
each one of them and let him try it then

224
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,700
you have to observe him after trying

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,860
each one and make sure that what you're

226
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,649
giving him is working for him now you

227
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,539
could in theory administer

228
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,068
each plant is a separate dose or you

229
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,958
could mix all the finished product

230
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:01,789
together and make one large batch of

231
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,068
teacher that way and see how it all

232
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:06,588
works that is up to you there are a

233
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:09,378
couple of ups and downs to this the

234
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:13,009
downside is some of those phenotypes may

235
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:15,860
contain THC if that medicine is working

236
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,778
for your son that is wonderful but if

237
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,749
anything should come up and your child

238
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:22,399
is tested for THC and he has tested

239
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:24,409
positive maybe they want to put him on

240
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,909
another medicine maybe something comes

241
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:27,708
up in the family maybe he gets hurt

242
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:30,139
somehow maybe something comes up you

243
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,698
said he shows signs of autism maybe they

244
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,769
want to test him to put him on an autism

245
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:36,049
medicine and they want to test to see if

246
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,028
he's on THC just because anything could

247
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:41,088
happen and if they test your child and

248
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:44,149
he does test for THC that could become a

249
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:47,540
problem the positive is you are now

250
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,149
making custom-tailored medicine for your

251
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,399
son if you find one phenotype out of a

252
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,499
pack of seeds that makes the perfect

253
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,389
medicine for your son you have solved a

254
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:58,490
problem and you've got him healthy and

255
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,990
happy for a long term you can produce

256
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,549
that medicine you can make the tincture

257
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,980
out of it you can administer that

258
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:05,688
teacher at the proper dose whenever he

259
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,509
needs it you can keep him in a good

260
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,849
condition that is the advantage to doing

261
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,558
a phenol hunt from seed and finding the

262
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,079
perfect phenotype for the medicinal

263
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:16,850
application which you are seeking like I

264
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,438
mentioned before the risk there is

265
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,720
getting the THC

266
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,240
into the child and having something go

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,278
wrong legally because there is THC in

268
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,928
your child's bloodstream maybe one of

269
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,759
those teachers that asked are you giving

270
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:30,948
him adderall and you said no it's CBD

271
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,568
maybe one of them is all uppity and they

272
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:34,758
want to throw a fit one day maybe

273
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:36,409
something happens maybe your child has

274
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,428
an outburst I'm not just saying your

275
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,928
kids a bad kid I'm saying I'm just

276
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,789
giving you options ideas of [ __ ] that

277
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:41,958
could go wrong maybe somebody throws

278
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,009
something at your kid and he throws

279
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,899
something back and now they're gonna

280
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,818
blame it on your kid because you give

281
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,620
him CBD and they're gonna drug test your

282
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:51,048
kid he's got THC in there and now it's a

283
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,578
whole new ballgame just try to keep I

284
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:54,558
just tried to look way ahead in the

285
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:56,298
future and see options so we can prevent

286
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:58,129
that kind of [ __ ] from happening but

287
00:10:56,298 --> 00:11:00,078
that could be the only downfall to this

288
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:02,178
if you do a Fino hunt you find that

289
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,370
perfectly custom-tailored phenotype that

290
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:06,289
works for your child then it's got THC

291
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,909
in it if it works I hope that is the

292
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,509
case I hope it works beautifully but I

293
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,980
don't want

294
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,019
trouble to come from it so keep that in

295
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,029
mind without a lab test you don't know

296
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,889
exactly what you are giving your kid

297
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,750
we know that it's cannabis we know that

298
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,580
you drew it we know what it's in it but

299
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,919
we don't know the finished cannabinoid

300
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,930
or terpene profile so without a

301
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,870
qualified lab I don't know how you would

302
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,449
determine how much THC or CBD is in your

303
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,509
product but I can make recommendations

304
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:37,430
on seeds that are very well known to be

305
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:39,529
very high in CBD and very low in THC in

306
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,049
Colorado the strain I am about to

307
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,480
recommend is grown in many hemp fields

308
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:47,359
in Colorado finished products are

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,750
allowed to have 0.3 percent THC which is

310
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,470
very little THC if a product tests any

311
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,750
higher than 0.3 percent THC it is either

312
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,060
considered cannabis or if it is supposed

313
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,480
to be a hemp plant it is then destroyed

314
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:04,909
if a hemp farmer produces too much hemp

315
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,039
that test what we call hot if it tests

316
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:09,980
higher than 0.3% THC

317
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,259
he can face legal ramifications in the

318
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,300
state of Colorado just by growing a

319
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,909
plant that accidentally tested too high

320
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:19,370
for a certain cannabinoid so people in

321
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:21,110
Colorado are very picky about the plants

322
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:25,610
that they are planting in their CBD

323
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,950
fields a very popular CBD varietal that

324
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,529
has been going around Colorado is known

325
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,509
as the cherry wine and if you do a

326
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,309
google search you should be able to find

327
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,990
the cherry wine seeds and you should be

328
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:40,069
able to get your hands on them very

329
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,919
easily cherry wine it is a high CBD hemp

330
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,480
variety one thing I need to suggest if

331
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,250
you choose to grow the cherry wine is

332
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
make sure you cut it down a little bit

333
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,990
early if it goes too late it will

334
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,770
develop some THC and it will become hot

335
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:57,320
most oftentimes a little bit of THC will

336
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,539
help with the effects of the CBD but

337
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,700
also we need to pay attention to how we

338
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,740
are medicating your Sun and we may need

339
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,900
to be careful for legal reasons like we

340
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,730
mentioned earlier so if you do let the

341
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,069
cherry wine go too long and it develops

342
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,600
THC it may be helpful but I would

343
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,520
recommend cutting it down early the

344
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,379
first few times and see how it works for

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,240
you once you've found a phenotype that

346
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,370
you really like then start playing with

347
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,960
that one grow multiple clones of the

348
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,370
same phenotype in the same environment

349
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,600
maybe grow four of them

350
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,759
know how much space you'll have I'm

351
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,860
gonna say grill for maybe cut one down a

352
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,019
week early maybe cut one down right on

353
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,339
time cut one down a week late and then

354
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,960
you've got another one that you can cut

355
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,089
down whenever you feel like it just cuz

356
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,680
we picked four for some stupid reason so

357
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,720
maybe do some experiments and find out

358
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,309
what cannabinoid profile you get by

359
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,060
letting them grow a little sooner a

360
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,250
little later

361
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,769
see what happens there so that is the

362
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,899
hemp variety that I would recommend that

363
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,909
is the cherry wine cherry wine has

364
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,769
become really popular in Colorado and

365
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,389
across the entire United States since

366
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,129
the farm bill allowed us to grow more

367
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:57,559
hemp so the cherry wine is really

368
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,179
popular it has been bred to many things

369
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,729
one thing I can recommend if you can't

370
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:04,789
find cherry wine seeds by itself I can

371
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,610
recommend the cherry Torino from llama

372
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:09,860
bean seeds you should find some very CBD

373
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,350
dominant phenotypes in the cherry Torino

374
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,289
as well alright let's talk more about

375
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,170
things that do have the potential to

376
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:20,120
produce one to one ratio phenotypes

377
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:21,829
again when you're growing from seed

378
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,259
you're going to see

379
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,940
fino typical variation you're going to

380
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,950
have different cannabinoid profiles

381
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,630
different terpene profiles possibly

382
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,100
completely different growth shapes and

383
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,620
structures you're going to see

384
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,389
differences in my opinion that is the

385
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,549
fun and the beauty of growing from seed

386
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,919
I get to pick the phenotype that works

387
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:41,479
perfectly for me in this case you get to

388
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,458
pick the phenotype that works perfectly

389
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,970
for your son so let's talk about some

390
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:48,829
one-to-one ratio strains a strain that I

391
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,930
see commonly testing with one-to-one

392
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,120
ratios is something called penny wise

393
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:55,129
penny wise should put out some

394
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,970
phenotypes it will give you a one-to-one

395
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:01,700
CBD to THC ratio some of course will

396
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,700
lean heavier to the CBD side and some

397
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,528
will lean heavier to the THC but you

398
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,450
will find that one to one ratio

399
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:11,000
phenotype in there if you run a few

400
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,520
seeds another one I can suggest is the

401
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,679
Harlequin I'm not sure that Harlequin is

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,879
available in seeds by itself it should

403
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,099
be available in feminized seeds

404
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,409
somewhere by now if not it has been

405
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,830
crossed to many other things you will

406
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:28,088
find many CBD heavy and one to one type

407
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:30,320
phenotypes in many Harlequin crosses

408
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,360
another strain I should mention that is

409
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,649
known for making high CBD and

410
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,289
potentially 1 to 1 ratio phenotypes is a

411
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,240
plant known as ac/dc I've seen some

412
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,399
breeding done to ac/dc and everything

413
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,948
that comes out seems to come out CBD

414
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,009
rich so if you can find seeds of ac/dc

415
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:51,008
or a cross of ac/dc you should find some

416
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:54,068
potentially CBD rich and possibly one to

417
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:56,470
one type phenotypes again this is going

418
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:59,649
to be phenotype dependent and you don't

419
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,329
have a lab to test for THC and CBD so

420
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,629
you're going to have to find a phenotype

421
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:06,128
that works for your son or yourself now

422
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,889
if you really want a better opportunity

423
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:10,839
to get a true one to one ratio something

424
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,509
you could do would be to grow something

425
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,459
like the cherry wine or another CBD rich

426
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:16,899
variety like the wife you could grow

427
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,789
some of that and then you could extract

428
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,649
that then you could grow something that

429
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:22,178
is high in THC like we're going to talk

430
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,769
about in just a moment and you could

431
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:25,208
extract that you can make your tincture

432
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:27,909
out of that then you've got a batch of

433
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:29,708
high THC tincture for yourself and for

434
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:32,769
your fiancee and then you've got a vat

435
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:34,328
of high CBD tincture for your son then

436
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:36,399
you could mix them at will you can have

437
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,748
a 50/50 ratio you could have a one two

438
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,458
three you could have a twenty two one

439
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,870
you can make whatever kind of blend you

440
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,508
wanted out of that you could customize

441
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,129
your cannabinoid ratios that would work

442
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,499
best for you for your son for your

443
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,120
fiancee however you wanted to do it for

444
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,800
the morning for the afternoon you can

445
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,198
make your perfect dose if you wanted to

446
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,609
do something like that again without lab

447
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,620
testing you're going to have to

448
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,568
experiment on yourself and see which

449
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,789
plant works best for you see which

450
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:03,399
ratios and which mixes work best for you

451
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:05,619
in my opinion that is part of the fun of

452
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,058
medicating with cannabis your condition

453
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,588
is a little more serious than some

454
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:10,240
people's so it's a little more critical

455
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,278
that we get it correct and also we're

456
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,480
working with a small person here so we

457
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,398
really need to make sure to get the

458
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,338
ratio dialed in so we don't create any

459
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:20,349
discomfort that may scare the child away

460
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,519
from using it as medicine again so we

461
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,318
really want to work on getting it right

462
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,668
but just a little trial and error it

463
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,639
won't take too long to get everything

464
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:30,278
dialed in but let's talk about some THC

465
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,860
rich strains also you said strains that

466
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:34,210
work well for PTSD I've got a traumatic

467
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:37,028
brain injury that comes with a little

468
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,159
bit of weird PTSD so I have experience

469
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:40,630
in that department I have noticed

470
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,700
through myself and talking with other

471
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,149
people that there are a few strains that

472
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,679
really do help with things like PTSD so

473
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,969
let's jump right into that one of my

474
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,470
favorites and

475
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,419
maybe just because I bread it and it is

476
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,159
named after me but one of my favorites

477
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:57,159
that works for my brain injury and my

478
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:59,860
PTSD is a little strain called lemon

479
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,620
Jeffrey lemon Jeffrey is a female lemon

480
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,599
skunk pollinated by a reversed golden

481
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:07,178
goat so that is a feminized seed line

482
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:10,449
lemon Jeffrey seems to work very well

483
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:12,730
for anxiety and PTSD type of situations

484
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,319
it really so I described that my brain

485
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,210
injury kind of makes it feel like my

486
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,470
record skips a little bit like my brain

487
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,090
will be going just fine but then

488
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,589
sometimes it'll just it'll just it'll

489
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:22,149
just and then it will keep going right

490
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,470
after that but then as it comes back

491
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,480
around to that part of the wreck wreck

492
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,159
wreck record and then so it'll just skip

493
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,890
a couple of times nobody else really

494
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,559
notices it but me but I feel like if I

495
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,610
smoke enough lemon Jeffrey or a couple

496
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,889
of the other strains that we're gonna

497
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,209
talk about that little skip on my record

498
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,620
just gets wiped right off

499
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,538
it's like record cleaner they just

500
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:42,519
polish up my CD cleans up my record

501
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:44,048
cleans my hard drive or whatever puts

502
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,429
all the files back in the correct drawer

503
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:46,000
so that my brain can access them

504
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,120
properly

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,730
I feel like strains that have limonene

506
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,279
really work well for my brain for my

507
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,769
PTSD for my traumatic brain injury so

508
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,829
lemon Jeffrey works beautifully for the

509
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:04,359
PTSD another strain I can recommend for

510
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:06,158
anxiety and PTSD is Jillybean there's

511
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,408
something in the Jilly bean that just

512
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,630
puts a smile on your face it makes the

513
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:13,750
PTSD kind of chill out any sort of bad

514
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:16,090
thoughts bad vibes bad moods it all just

515
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,710
kind of just it goes away the bad vibes

516
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,899
are washed away when you smoke the lemon

517
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,460
Jeffrey and the Jilly bean it just kind

518
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,380
of it just makes you feel better you're

519
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,480
in a better mood and I don't know if

520
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,010
it's the high from it I don't know if

521
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,808
it's the Terps I don't know if it's the

522
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:30,579
specific cannabinoids in either one of

523
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,899
those I think the limonene and the lemon

524
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:33,279
Jeffrey really has something to do with

525
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,620
it just from as much attention as I've

526
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,058
paid to that limonene Terp I noticed

527
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:39,759
thatone helps my brain a lot but the

528
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:41,589
Jillybean kind of does the same thing

529
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,929
it's not as potent it doesn't last as

530
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:45,819
long but it'll get me there and another

531
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,250
strain that works really well for the

532
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:50,889
PTSD and anxiety type of stuff is a

533
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,919
strain called Clementine Clementine

534
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:57,809
smells a lot like Jillybean Clementine

535
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:01,059
is very similar to the lemon Jeffrey

536
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:02,889
Clementine has lemon skunk in it

537
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,599
lemon Jeffrey also has

538
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,280
lemon skunk in it so that makes me think

539
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,679
there's something about that lemon skunk

540
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,769
Terp or that lemon skunk strain that is

541
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,110
doing something good for the PTSD for

542
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,430
the anxiety type of conditions now I

543
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,659
just thought of one more that I should

544
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,130
mention that fits right into this

545
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,269
category and when I say the name of the

546
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,040
strain you're gonna go oh yeah that

547
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,220
makes sense but one that really works

548
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,619
well for PTSD and anxiety and social

549
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,450
anxiety sort of stuff is a little strain

550
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,399
called tangi a few people have heard of

551
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,569
tangi it's getting kind of popular you

552
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,420
probably have heard of that one a couple

553
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,789
times but that orange citrusy chirp

554
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,610
seems to really do something really nice

555
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:42,099
for the traumatic brain injury PTSD type

556
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,049
of stuff now those strains will be high

557
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,669
in THC but they're not going to be the

558
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,710
highest they will be in the high 20s

559
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,779
have grown properly the mid to high 20s

560
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,000
some of them may hit 30 that lemon

561
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,649
Jeffrey has hit 30 before but not all of

562
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,900
them are going to be super high in THC

563
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,759
but it's more about the effect I think

564
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,300
you need those Terps to get what you

565
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,849
need

566
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,480
I think the THC if it were fireworks the

567
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,730
THC

568
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,519
tells you how high the firework is gonna

569
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,529
climb then the Terps are kind of what

570
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,930
color's the firework is gonna put off so

571
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:13,299
the Terps decide the display the THC

572
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,620
decides how high it's gonna go so I

573
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,659
think the terpenes are going to have a

574
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:20,169
lot to do with it don't focus too much

575
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,210
on that THC number THC is definitely

576
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,370
important but the Terps are what we need

577
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,230
if we're aiming for a specific condition

578
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:28,479
and you ask for something for the PTSD

579
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,279
so I think that's gonna help you out now

580
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,990
again without lab testing we don't know

581
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,029
exactly what type of ratios you're

582
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,279
getting I know that the cherry wine will

583
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,410
be rich in CBD I know that the few I

584
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:40,660
mentioned will have the opportunity and

585
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,330
the potential to produce high CBD

586
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,450
phenotypes and also one-to-one ratios

587
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:48,250
also other types of specific ratios I'm

588
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,470
not sure what you're going to get but

589
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,420
they do have the potential without a lab

590
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,190
test you'll find something in there that

591
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,019
works for you it's sort of a kind of a

592
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,910
placebo effect if I gave you a bunch of

593
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,410
lab numbers you would believe that that

594
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,480
one with that good number works without

595
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,060
those numbers the one that works will

596
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,250
work for you just let rely on your body

597
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,440
rely on what you observe in your son and

598
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,839
you will know exactly which plant to

599
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,090
keep using alright so those are a bunch

600
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,319
of different options for strains the you

601
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,119
asked information on you've got

602
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,099
something CBD something 1/2

603
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,599
something THC with all of that

604
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:21,519
information I hope you have made a

605
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,599
decision on if you want to grow or if

606
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,819
you want to stick to getting those

607
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,558
tinctures you're going to have to grow a

608
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,658
good amount to produce enough tincture

609
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,450
to keep the entire family medicated I

610
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,630
think I'm the only podcast online right

611
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,630
now without a CBD teacher sponsorship or

612
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,028
some sort of CBD teacher advertising but

613
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,940
there are many options available for

614
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:45,130
quality CBD teachers make sure you go at

615
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,600
the reputable company if the place you

616
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,330
are shopping has become too expensive

617
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,548
shop around look for more options like I

618
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:53,558
said don't be fooled by gimmicky [ __ ]

619
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:56,168
don't fall for snake oil read a lot of

620
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,240
reviews shop around if you're gonna buy

621
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,070
a product type in the name of that

622
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,500
product and then type in customer

623
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:04,480
reviews and go read a lot of reviews see

624
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,130
what people think fish out the [ __ ]

625
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,778
reviews some of those reviews are gonna

626
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,820
be fake they were left by the company

627
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:11,409
learn how to find that [ __ ] and then

628
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:12,970
read the reviews and see what you think

629
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,770
about the products you don't have to get

630
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,600
it from that one source there are many

631
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,308

to grow I want everybody to be able to
