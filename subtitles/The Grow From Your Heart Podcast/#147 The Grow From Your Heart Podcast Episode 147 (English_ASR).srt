00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,409
you guys I [ __ ] up you guys I recorded

23

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,978
course our friend Lindsay the traveling

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,840
stoner this evening I pulled out my zoom

27
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:14,118
h6 I took out my trusty memory card I

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,010
threw it my macbook and the files are

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,599
all there I can grab the files and I can

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,180
move them to my macbook but for some

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,349
reason none of that [ __ ] is playable so

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,450
none of the material that I recorded

33
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:26,149
with Gavin granny will be aired on this

34
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,280
podcast unless one of my tech-savvy

35
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,379
friends is able to get this SD card and

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,210
pull this information off of there in a

37
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,739
usable format because so far I'm [ __ ]

38
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:35,149
I tried for about an hour all I did was

39
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:37,039
frustrate myself I was not able to get

40
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,210
it going so let me turn down the music

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,310
and say this a little bit better you

42
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:42,140

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,118
recorded is lost it's available on her

44
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,950
Facebook we did a Facebook live video of

45
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,750
it but I think that's the only way

46
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,500
you're going to hear or see any of that

47
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,819
episode granny I apologize technology

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,039
[ __ ] me I don't know what else to say

49
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,339
Brett I apologize Lindsey I apologize

50
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,739
the bad news is the podcast is lost and

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,079
gone for [ __ ] ever technology aided

52
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:06,199
Technology kicked my ass you can't win

53
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,090
every time the good news however is that

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,709
Davin grannies got to come back to the

55
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,150
show and Brett's got to come back and

56
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,370
Lindsey has to come back and we have to

57
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,990
do another podcast I think I want to do

58
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,610
a podcast with granny by herself and

59
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,200
with Brett by himself and then a podcast

60
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,459
with the group together I think granny

61
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,539
should be on the podcast kind of

62
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,270
frequently because she has a lot of

63
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,039
great [ __ ] to say so I actually think

64
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,659
granny needed she had so much to say I

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,889
encouraged her to start her own podcast

66
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,689
was something that actually said when

67
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,399
she was here so I apologize you guys I

68
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:33,259

69

92
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,180
Comedy Works downtown is probably the

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,489
best comedy club on the planet if it's

94
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,469
the second it's the second best to the

95
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,719
comedy store in Los Angeles California

96
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,180
other than that Comedy Works is the best

97
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,069
comedy club in the world now since I'm

98
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,950

Comedy Works hey guys Joey Diaz walked

103
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,620
out onstage and he grabbed the mic now

104
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,960
before he could get to the mic

105
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,719
he got a standing ovation Joey walked

106
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,700
out to a standing ovation he grabbed the

107
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,409
mic and he said what up you bad

108

109
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,229
Joey starts the show and I knew it was

110
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,789
gonna be a party from then he had this

111
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,429
little strut in his stride the whole

112
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,900
time Joey was killing it the show was

113
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,250
hosted by a comedian whose name I cannot

114
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,939

122
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,009

204
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,770
the band tour yeah because I've been

205
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,240
seeing Joseph Israel for probably I've

206
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,698
been watching his band for probably ten

207
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,340
years this was I've seen several of

208
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,710
their shows I've seen this band progress

209
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,119
and come a long long way and last

210
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,978
night's show is the best show that I've

211
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,750
ever seen them do it was the second to

212
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,068
last show on their tour and you could

213
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,449
tell that they just played until they

214
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,710
were done tonight's show they're not

215
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,210
gonna have a lot of energy cuz they wore

216
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,560
themselves out last night whoever sees

217
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:13,138
them tonight I'm sorry I drained all

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,728
their energy ah my favorite album from

219
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,379
Joseph Israel is an album called gone

220
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:19,199
are the days I think it was his original

221
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,639
release they played there probably 15

222
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,990
songs on there I think a couple of more

223
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,400
like dub remixes so there's like

224
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,778
probably 10 songs in there they must

225
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,908
have played seven or eight of them and

226
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,050
they played all my favorites that I

227
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:28,740
could yell out of song and they would

228
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,689
play it for me

229
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
they weren't gonna play a song called

230
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,569
the truth is one of my favorites and

231
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,829
there was a break you know when the

232
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,540
musicians are like tuning their guitars

233
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,939
they're all talk and it taking a drink I

234
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,200
yelled out truth and I was like right in

235
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,009
the front row so Joseph looked at me

236
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,810
like oh yeah

237
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,519
and they talked about it for a minute

238
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,839
and they said we haven't played this we

239
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,939
don't practice this we haven't played

240
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,369
this since we recorded the gone are the

241
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,600
days album and they started seeing the

242
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,610
chorus they just started doing like a

243
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,980
really cool acapella harmony version of

244
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,080
the chorus and then once that chorus

245
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,759
ended the guitar player started playing

246
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,699
the guitar lick and they played the song

247
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,870
truth for me it wasn't tight and it

248
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,430
wasn't perfect but you know what it was

249
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,040
beautiful that my friends tried to play

250
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,990
that song for me so much love to

251
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,580
Joseph's Israel and the Jerusalem band

252
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,189
and the entire crew at Bru's Ale House

253
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,189
had an amazing time I got to smoke after

254
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,750
the show with a couple of the guys

255
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,089
something I should mention I have been a

256
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,519
huge fan of a bass player by the name of

257
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,899
Chris Meredith he plays with Joseph

258
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,969
Israel in the Jerusalem band but he's

259
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,679
also known as a recording artist in

260
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,170
Jamaica and he's also well known for

261
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,180
playing with Stephen Marley I walked

262
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,830
into the building and Chris Meredith was

263
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,718
just standing there talking to Joseph

264
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,280
Israel and I realized he was gonna be

265
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,169
the blade bass player for the show that

266
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,179
night they put a huge smile on my face

267
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,860
because he recorded Joseph's album with

268
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,939
him he went on tour for the first tour

269
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,800
and then he had to go back to Jamaica

270
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,480
and he took off for a little while so he

271
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,129
didn't see him on tour with Joseph it

272
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,570
was great to see Chris and the original

273
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,850
drummer back together in the rhythm

274
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,470
section I actually got to meet the

275
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,790
original keyboard player from the gone

276
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,470

297
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,409
smoke session in the back of the club at

298
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,829

299
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,360

move on to some grow knowledge you guys

302
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,560
been talking about my weekend and my

303
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,958
week long enough

304
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,909
let's talk about Gro knowledge a few

305
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,619
episodes back I was asked how to handle

306
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:51,509
grasshoppers and what I've noticed is

307
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,339
everybody is getting bombarded with

308
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,079
grasshoppers and their outdoor cannabis

309
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,670
grow this year the number one way that

310
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,528
you can get rid of your grasshoppers is

311
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,969
just to clean up if you can mow all the

312
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:01,528
grass mow all the weeds get rid of

313
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,610
anywhere for them to live get rid of all

314
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:04,318
the stuff for them to eat the

315
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,149
grasshoppers won't want to come around I

316
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:08,458
understand that your neighbors probably

317
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,808
have a big-ass pile of grass and leaves

318
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,399
and [ __ ] in their yard that you cannot

319
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,509
do anything about it's illegal to go

320
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,759
over there with the torch and just burn

321
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,438
that [ __ ] down so if you're having

322
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,259
problems with grasshoppers somebody

323
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:21,778
recommended to me garlic and fermented

324
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,308
garlic sprays to help keep grasshoppers

325
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,528
and other pests away I assumed that this

326
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:27,240
would work on most insects and most

327
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:30,208
living creatures if you ferment some

328
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,370
garlic or mush garlic up into a spray

329
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,599
and spray that around your plants on and

330
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,669
or around your plants and on the

331
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,019
perimeter of your plants most bugs are

332
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,248
going to stay away from that and

333
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,688
definitely you will not have any

334
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:41,610
vampires so if you're worried about

335
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,528
vampires in the garden you could double

336
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,180
up on the garlic spray you'll be just

337
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:46,889
fine so shout out to the person that

338
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,989
told me about fermented garlic sprays

339
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:51,720
and using them in my garden to keep away

340
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,549
grasshoppers outdoors because I don't

341
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,809
grow outdoors myself very much but a lot

342
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:56,549
of our friends do and I think you know

343
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:58,198
the next episode may feature our buddy

344
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:59,490
Jesse and we're gonna talk about some

345
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,508
outdoor stuff shout out to Jesse if

346
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,009
you're listening to this call me dude

347
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,629
let's plan this episode so we can get it

348
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,490
recorded well record it at my house

349
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,019
we'll use my computer we won't use the

350
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,879
zoom h6 because I'm paranoid to that

351
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,318
thing I'm afraid it's gonna break and

352
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,289
not record the damn show again so

353
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:15,448
probably won't do that ah grasshoppers

354
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:16,528
yes emails I've got some emails here at

355
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:18,448
my phone people have asked some

356
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:19,889
questions you guys asked great questions

357
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:21,659
I want to give a shout out to everybody

358
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,399
that sends me an email I'm gonna try to

359
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,198
read all of the questions over time on

360
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,068
the air but I'm a little bit backed up

361
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:29,039
so I'm gonna have to record more

362
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:31,019
episodes anyway here is an email they

363
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,659
came from let's see how did he sign it

364
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,480
he signed it as our 4/20 so shout out to

365
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,039
Mazza 4/20 his email says hoping you can

366
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,420
read my questions on the show been

367
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,688
loving the show helps me get through my

368
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,789
day at a mind-numbing job with robots do

369
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:46,289
you work with robots or just like people

370
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,458
who are unaware and people who are

371
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,019
programmed to act like robots I'm

372
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,028
curious you know he said questions for

373
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,698
the show when you flip to twelve twelve

374
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:55,169
or eleven thirteen DJ short style how

375
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:57,539
long till you want to go from

376
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,399
metal-halide to HPS

377
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,789
now I want to talk about this 12 12 or

378
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,039
11 13 DJ short style thing what Mazar

379
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:07,649
420 is asking is when I change my light

380
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,039
cycle from my vegetative stage either 24

381
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,079
hours on or an 18-6 cycle or maybe a

382
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,000
16-8 depends on where you are I when I

383
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,610
change my light cycle to my flowering

384
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,029
phase which would normally be 12 12 or

385
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,990
he says the 11 13 DJ short style let me

386
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,779
talk about that for a minute

387
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,269
DJ short is a well-known breeder he's a

388
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,069
great speaker he's an author is well

389
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,850
educated and very passionate about the

390
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,280
cannabis plant

391
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,409
DJ short breeds amazing strains he is

392
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,389
known for the blueberry DJ shortbread

393
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,069
the flow so there's something in DJ's

394
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,669
shirts catalog that you have smoked and

395
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,560
you have enjoyed they came from all DJ

396
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:45,899
now DJ does a trick when he is flowering

397
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:50,009
his plants he does not run them for 12

398
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,750
on 12 off he does 11 hours on and 13

399
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:55,429
hours off

400
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:58,799
his theory on this is that you will see

401
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,989
broader variance in fee no typical

402
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,309
expression from your plants so if you're

403
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,620
a breeder and you're looking for

404
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,629
phenotypes this extra hour really lets

405
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,549
the plants express themselves and show

406
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:10,649
the variation and show their potential

407
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:13,229
it also will save you one hour of

408
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:16,559
electricity over a sixty-five day cycle

409
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,330
which is gonna be 65 hours kilowatt

410
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,809
hours that you're not spending on your

411
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,700
lights

412
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:23,069
it's also gonna be an hour resting off

413
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,170
of your air conditioning it's also going

414
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,750
to some people think it increases their

415
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:29,969
yields I tried it I didn't like what it

416
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,440
did to some of my plants I did like what

417
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,450
it did this some of my plants so it's

418
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
very plant specific it's strains

419
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,310
specific it may be phenotype specific I

420
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,690
have not experimented enough to know but

421
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,419
a lot of people in the community are

422
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,460
switching to the 1113 method it saves

423
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,500
money it saves time and if you've got

424
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,879
the right varietals it will work for you

425
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
one thing I've noticed some of my

426
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,730
heavier sativas didn't like it in the

427
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,360
beginning it took him a while to get

428
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,279
used to it

429
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,840
I liked my sativa is on twelve twelve

430
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,579
and then toward the end of the phase

431
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,139
that's when I would start dropping down

432
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,810
the timers they didn't seem to really

433
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,389
like it when I went 13 hours of darkness

434
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,299
right away so that catches us up to

435
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,338
speed on the DJ short 11:13 method now

436
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,559
he says how long once you do this flip

437
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,270
do you want to go from metal halide to

438
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,209
HPS that's his first part of his

439
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,220
question generally I let it go 10 to 14

440
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,990
days rocking the metal halide when I see

441
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
the bud starting to form when I see

442
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,629
those little pre buds and the pre

443
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,190
flowers just starting to pop up they're

444
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,899
getting a little dandelions that's

445
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,620
usually when I switch in that bulb if

446
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,179
you if you really want to go crazy do it

447
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,070
three weeks because I think when you

448
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,389
flip those plants are gonna stretch for

449
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,400
about three weeks and keeping that

450
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,199
halide bulb in there really I think

451
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,240
helps prevent them from stretching so

452
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,310
much so keep that halide in there for 10

453
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,919
to 14 days if you want to go extreme go

454
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,299
21 days but you may slow down bud

455
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,279
development at that point I like to

456
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,449
switch it in there about that 14th day

457
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,549
because that's what my buds are gonna

458
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,500
start happening one thing that you can

459
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,990
utilize that I've done and had great

460
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,580
success with is mix and match spectrums

461
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,370
use a little bit of metal halide and use

462
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,200
a little bit of HBS if you can so I had

463
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,970
a I've got a reflector it's called the

464
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,170
Gro Zilla and I haven't used it in a

465
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,350
long time I should fire it up and do

466
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,779
some experiments with it just

467
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,850
fun but this reflector holds two bulbs

468
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:11,829
and they say not to put more than a

469
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,870
thousand watt total in there it may say

470
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,330
1200 total so you could put two 600

471
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,909
bulbs in this one reflector what I did I

472
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:21,100
put a 600 watt high pressure sodium and

473
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:24,309
a 400 watt metal halide in there and

474
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,620
hung that bulb in a 5x5 hydro Hut and I

475
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,989
put nine three gallon pots under there

476
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,810
and honestly I grew some of the most

477
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,759
photogenic and most aromatic most

478
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:36,039
flavorful and most potent cannabis I

479
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,929
have ever grown came from that 5x5 Hut

480
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,179
with that mix spectrum light there was

481
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,159
some very impressive cannabis the only

482
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:44,379
problem was it didn't harvest what I

483
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,240
wished it would have uh when I heart

484
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,500
when I use a thousand watt HBS in one of

485
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,330
those huts with proper ducting and

486
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,429
venting and air conditioning I can pull

487
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,660
a pound and a half really close to two

488
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,649
pounds it's hard to hit two pounds in

489
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,299
those huts because you're really limited

490
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,129
on height and space so you gotta like

491
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,629
top them out and pull them out real far

492
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,490
and train them you can get a pound and a

493
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:03,909
half out of one of those huts when I did

494
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,129
the HPS metal halide combo I got right

495
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,469
about a pound in a corner so it didn't

496
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,970
do what I would expect I think that 600

497
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,519
watt light kind of didn't let it push

498
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,050
but the flavor and the aroma and the

499
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,579
potency made up for the lack of weight

500
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:16,899
because it was for me I was growing it

501
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,120
from my own head stash so I didn't need

502
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,350
a whole bunch all right so that's the

503
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,960
first party good question I would do it

504
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,670
somewhere between 14 and 21 days 10 days

505
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,259
if you're trying to go early 14 days is

506
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,579
about ideal 21 days if you're really

507
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,559
trying to keep those plants short

508
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,690
because that's that halide lamp is gonna

509
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,059
keep them from stretching on you as part

510
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,670
of why we do that so he also says also

511
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,079
was wondering how long once under 12 12

512
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:41,379
do you wait to switch your nutrients

513
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,580
from veg to bloom he also says hope to

514
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,250
hear my questions get answered on the

515
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,230
show sincerely massive 420 so he's

516
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,149
wondering how long from the day we

517
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,940
switch to 12:12 do we wait to switch our

518
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:54,250
nutrients from veg to bloom I kind of do

519
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,920
a slow transition I believe that your

520
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,100
plant is going to absorb somewhere

521
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,599
between 80 and 90% of its nitrogen that

522
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,830
all that all of it's going to observe

523
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,539
there's whole life it's gonna absorb

524
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,190
most of that through the vegetative

525
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,480
stage once you hit flowering once you

526
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,650
get to that second or third week of

527
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,450
flowering you're not gonna use a whole

528
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,490
lot of nitrogen just enough to keep the

529
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,350
leaves green and keep the plant moving

530
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,839
so nitrogen is gonna kind of fizzle out

531
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:18,599
so you can switch the nutrients right

532
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,068
away if you'd like to or

533
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,279
you can keep those nutrients going

534
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:25,500
slowly and taper so if you're if you've

535
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,599
got grow and you've got bloom maybe go

536
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,099
seven to ten days with that grow before

537
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,558
you pull out the grow nutrient and throw

538
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,269
in the bloom it or you can just switch

539
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,089
right away it's up to you it kind of

540
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:38,940
depends on the strains also Gorilla Glue

541
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:40,649
really likes to eat so I kind of stick

542
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,460
with my veg nutrients for an extra week

543
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,660
or two with the gorilla glue things like

544
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,860
flow-flow doesn't require a lot of food

545
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,960
flow will just grow like a

546
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,479
son-of-a-bitch so I'll switch flow right

547
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,038
away when I go 12:12 that day they get

548
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,779
fed their bloom nutrients they start

549
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,140
getting basically your first day of

550
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:00,629
bloom nutrients aren't very far off from

551
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,799
your last week of veg nutrients so it

552
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,169
shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch

553
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,990
either way but somewhere between that

554
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,429
first day and about 7 to 10 days in is

555
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,750
when I will totally have switched from

556
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,038
vegetable um nutrients it kind of

557
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,079
depends on the plant it kind of depends

558
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,759
on what I'm doing it kind of kind of

559
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,889
depends on the room the strain the brand

560
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,558
of nutrients if I'm using botanic or

561
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,330
bottled newts my switch from my veg

562
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,639
stage to my flower phase like I said is

563
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,649
not very different it's a base nutrient

564
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,419
it's cal-mag liquid karma and maybe a

565
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,130
little bit of what else am i using in

566
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,080
there potassium silicates and there

567
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,429
wouldn't be a whole lot else oh there's

568
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,480
a dog resting on my feet and I just move

569
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,769
my foot came from right in the head I'm

570
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,599
sorry puppy I didn't mean to do that boy

571
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:38,429
I'm sorry I apologize big shout out to

572
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,538
make the dog you guys make the dogs been

573
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,100
hanging out with me for a couple days a

574
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:42,929
cool-ass dog you guys would like him

575
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,058
sorry I just kicked your a the head boy

576
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,440
I feel bad everyone on the show hears me

577
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,200
apologizing I won't do it again buddy

578
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,240
I'll pet you so uh yeah my fedja newts

579
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,580
there'll be some what did I say bass

580
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,470
nutrients which would be the botanic air

581
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,939
pure blend pro grow and then you've got

582
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,019
some cal-mag in there maybe a little bit

583
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,600
of liquid karma and some potassium

584
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,298
silicates that's basically my veg mix I

585
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,769
would add something in there for roots

586
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:07,950
some sort of root inoculate use whatever

587
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,619
you would like you can use either the

588
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:14,190
plus life from veg bloom big shout-out

589
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:16,678
to veg bloom you could use the rhizome

590
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,179
mix the botanic air makes you could use

591
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,380
what am I think there's a there's one

592
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,480
product I'm really thinking I can't say

593
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,679
the name Oh G bio war use some OG bio

594
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,630
war on that [ __ ] to get your roots

595
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,620
going so add that to it for roots and

596
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,320
you got pretty much everything you need

597
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,609
there week one a flower you basically

598
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,808
want to feed the same thing that you've

599
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:32,009
been feeding for the last couple weeks

600
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:33,089
of veg

601
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,369
because your plants are just gonna start

602
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,959
transitioning so week one you've got the

603
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:39,089
option a week one to switch out that

604
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,740
pure blend Pro grow to the bloom formula

605
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,959
or you can do it at the start of week

606
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,759
two or definitely do it by week three

607
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,590
your plants are gonna need that much

608
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,599
nitrogen by week three and if you keep

609
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:51,029
going with the grow formula you may burn

610
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,399
them so you can go the first week or two

611
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:55,319
with your grow newts and then by week

612
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,580
three definitely switch all the way into

613
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,829
your flowering newts you don't need to

614
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,879
add everything by week three you really

615
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,649
don't need a lot at week three you

616
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,900
concerned introducing things slowly

617
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,790
maybe get some sugars in there at week

618
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,230
three you don't need a lot at week three

619
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,549
by week four or five and six that's

620
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,750
where things really start cracking

621
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:11,819
that's when you're gonna want to start

622
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,079
adding bud boosters whatever you gonna

623
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,309
use to make the weight a little thicker

624
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,500
or whatever you gonna use to sweeten it

625
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,509
up four or five and six is when all that

626
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,220
[ __ ] comes in so if you're running a

627
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,869
strain that likes a lot of nitrogen keep

628
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,150
those nitrogen nutrients coming keep

629
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,409
that base grow new coming for the first

630
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,820
couple of weeks if you've got a strain

631
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,290
that's got plenty of nutrients if your

632
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,849
leaves are nice and lush green if

633
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,559
they're dark green don't even worry

634
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,480
about that grow new go ahead and switch

635
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,220
it over to the bloom nutrients alright I

636
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,529
hope that answered your question I know

637
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,940
I used a botanic hair as a an example

638
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,250
that's the brand that I use in my

639
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,769
small-batch personal growth for myself

640
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,619
if I'm gonna smoke it it's probably

641
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:48,720
grown with botanic care I do plan on

642
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,369
doing a side by side between botanic

643
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,559
hair and veg bloom in the near future

644
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,299
and I will be completely honest about

645
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,629
what I see and I will share my

646
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,889
experience and my results here on the

647
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,990
podcast you guys make sure you support

648
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,490
botanic hair and veg bloom I've used

649
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,539
them both in different environments in

650
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,700
different scenarios that are both

651
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,519
wonderful products I can't wait to run a

652
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,220
side-by-side I've got a 5 by 5 Hut and

653
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,779
another 5 by 5 hydro Hut in a room with

654
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,210
very similar light with the same lights

655
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,950
they're on a flip box every 12 hours one

656
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,600
comes on one shuts off so we got a

657
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,640
flowering chamber that's always being

658
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,049
used I'm gonna do veg bloom on one side

659
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,060
I want to do botanic hair on the other

660
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,529

661
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,230

662
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:29,700
you guys know how it goes alright I want

663
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,140
to thank our friend Masdar for 20 for

664
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,390
sending me a great email that gave me a

665
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,740
lot of information to ramble off at you

666
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,560
guys I'm pulling up the next email here

667
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,670
on my phone the next email comes from he

668
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,519
signed it with his real name I don't

669
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,930
know they says hi my name is Kelvin I

670
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,430
let's see let's read this we have spoken

671
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,820
before but I have another question so I

672
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,710
live in Oklahoma City where

673
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,779
he gets pretty hot it can get into a

674
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,789
hundred or above in my garden room I was

675
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,529
wondering if a bigger carbon filter

676
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,240
would help me out any right now I'm

677
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,339
running a 400 watt high-pressure sodium

678
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,130
and a metal halide Apolo light with a

679
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:01,539
four-inch carbon filter and inline fan I

680
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,160
was thinking about getting an air

681
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,099
conditioner but I don't want to if I can

682
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,350
lower temps with the carbon filters

683
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:10,869
during the day the temps get from a

684
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:15,399
hundred and ten to a hundred and fifteen

685
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:17,169
thank you Jeff growers love dude 110 and

686
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,060
115 in your grow room that is

687
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,470
tremendously warm for your plants your

688
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,809
plants are freaking out development

689
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,370
stops growth and development stops

690
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,859
production stops inside your plant

691
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:29,229
around 85 90 degrees unless you're

692
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:30,939
introducing co2 if you're inducing co2

693
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,480
if you've got very high levels of co2

694
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,309
your plants can tolerate in the 90s 110

695
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,750
to 115 you're expressing the [ __ ] out of

696
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,279
those plants the buds are starting to

697
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,859
spread out your getting Airy buds

698
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,420
they're gonna be fluffy they're gonna be

699
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,009
small the plants are gonna be stunted

700
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,570
growth the humidity is probably getting

701
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,819
[ __ ] ridiculous in that room with that

702
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:50,980
type of heat the good thing about this

703
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:52,359
is you're not gonna have any bugs no

704
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,329
damn bug in the world is gonna want to

705
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,409
hang out 115 degree grow room so your

706
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:58,179
main question let's get to the point

707
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,370
here your question is well a carbon

708
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,200
filter help cool that room no not at all

709
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:05,500
carbon filter does not provide any

710
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,200
cooling you need you you need to

711
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,000
introduce cooler air into that room and

712
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,730
you need to remove the hot air from the

713
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,410
room a fan won't help you because it's

714
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,089
just gonna blow hot air around you need

715
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,960
to exchange the air you got to get that

716
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,449
heat out of there

717
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,880
maybe bigger ducting and a bigger blower

718
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,519
to blow the heat out but a bigger carbon

719
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,860
filter won't help you cool the room you

720
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,859
need an air conditioner ifit's a large

721
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:31,359
room get yourself a window model like

722
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,829
the window kind if it's a smaller room

723
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,990
and you don't have a window for it get

724
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:37,809
yourself one of those portable rolling

725
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,569
air conditioners I really like the

726
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,789
soleus 14,000 BTU portable air

727
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,039
conditioner they do not pay me they do

728
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,149
not sponsor me it's what I buy if I need

729
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,460
an air conditioner or rolling air

730
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,320
conditioner for a home grow or a small

731
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,440
grow that's what I go get is one of

732
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,939
those soleus 14,000 BTU it's a heater

733
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,740
it's an air conditioner and it's a

734
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,750
dehumidifier all in one unit

735
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,769
it's about waist-high it's only about

736
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,539
three feet tall it looks like

737
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,029
little r2d2 you guys and it's got a duck

738
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:05,710
that runs out and I think it's got a

739
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,509
duck they can come in also if you choose

740
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,400
to ducked in but I don't ducked in I

741
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,379
just let the air conditioner recycle the

742
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,000
air in the room is where that air comes

743
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,950
from so that air is already cool kind of

744
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,630
that's going into the compressor and

745
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,480
then it blows the heat through a duct a

746
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,590
four inch duct and you can mount that

747
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,170
duct wherever you want

748
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:24,459
I usually board up a window cut a four

749
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,050
inch hole through the window put a duct

750
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,579
mount onto that window and run that four

751
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,220
inch air conditioning duct right out of

752
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:32,769
there

753
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,350
that 14,000 BTU unit would be overkill

754
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,700
for your 400 watt HBS and your metal

755
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:41,619
halide apollo light i'm assuming that

756
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,840
your small grow room is inside of

757
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,489
another room since it's so small and I'm

758
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,689
not I'm not I'm not worried that you

759
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,910
have a small girl band I make it funny

760
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,620
but I'm just wondering is this grow room

761
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,480
inside of another room do you have this

762
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:54,099
like did you construct a small room

763
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,440
inside of a bedroom or this maybe a

764
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:59,109
closet also but if it's a small room

765
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,610
maybe you can air-conditioned that room

766
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,259
a little bit better and then duct the

767
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:03,969
heat out of your grow and just

768
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:05,589
air-conditioned the outside environment

769
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,230
so that you're bringing in cooler air

770
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,399
you just need cooler air in that room

771
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,110
carbon filters not gonna cool off the

772
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,790
air a fan is not gonna cool off the air

773
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,740
you actually need some freon in there

774
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,879
you need an air conditioner bro so I

775
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,470
hope that works I hope answered your

776

a big old fat dab of pineapple jack

798
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:05,470
shatter from tur pax and I dunked it in

799
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,250
OG ghost rain haze fresh Terps from our

800
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,650
friends at Evo labs but I feel like my

801
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,190
brain was put on a rocket and launched

802
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,840
into outer space and

803
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,370
it blew up like one of those beautiful

804
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,949
fireworks and then it all just came back

805
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,939
together and floated down into my head

806
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,410
but that's what happens when you dunk

807
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,620
your dad's in Terps and you take big ol

808
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:27,170
fat dabs whoo shots everybody involved

809
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:29,269
in making these Terps happen I had the

810
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,759
lab manager from Evo labs on the last

811
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,099
podcast and that's the one that the

812
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,930
memory card ate and we cannot listen to

813
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:37,429
so sorry Brett I wish we could have done

814
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,509
that but Brett that means you got to

815
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,170
come back on the show and smoke some

816
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,359
turps with me

817
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,860
I owe a huge thank you to dab and granny

818
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,649
and I owe a huge thank you to Brett

819
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:48,679
davon granny showed up with enough Terps

820
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:51,259
to dab out an army and Brett will try to

821
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,519
compete with that so big thanks to you

822
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,200
guys were showing up to the podcast too

823
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,569
well prepared also thanks to the canna

824
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,240
Canyon for letting me invade the small

825
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:01,159
corner of their facility I had four

826
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,240
couches and a table occupied and nobody

827
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,490
can hang out in that region because

828
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,569
we're doing the podcast I didn't mind if

829
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,769
people hung out but when they saw the

830
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:08,000
microphones come out and they heard me

831
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:09,859
talking they all just took off to be

832
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,029
polite I don't mind if they hang out I

833
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,529
like it I think it's cool I like the

834
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,509
ambience and the vibe in the background

835
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,460
all right I am rambling like a

836
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,619
[ __ ] hashtag they like it when I

837
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,380
ramble I wanted to share with you guys a

838
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:23,689
little progress on my most current

839
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,830
breeding project if you follow me you

840
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,269
know that I am a breeder

841
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:28,819
I am the head breeder for I read

842
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,519
genetics I am currently working with a

843
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:33,049
male plant that I call a rise the strain

844
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,420
is known as arised the male plant

845
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,309
himself has been named Solomon that is

846
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,710
King Solomon he is going to father many

847
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:41,509
children he will be the grandfather to

848
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,960
many children but Solomon is my male

849
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:44,269
plant

850
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,850
he is a and a rise plant which is a

851
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:48,589
cross of a golden goat female that was

852
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:50,719
pollinated by a Daybreaker male

853
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:52,849
Daybreaker came from gage green genetics

854
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,490
so much love and respect today - gage

855
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:58,429
green the Daybreaker is Joseph's og and

856
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,920
Kim D so there's gonna be a little bit

857
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,900
of og cush and Kim dog lineage in there

858
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,910
and then I crossed that - I put the

859
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,980
pollen from that male on to the golden

860
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,170
goat the golden goat is Island sweet

861
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,360
skunk and Romulan and a Hawaiian sativa

862
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,480
so you got that tropical tasty flavor i

863
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,069
pollinated it with that cushy skunky

864
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,019
funk flavor a little bit of everything

865
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,589
in my opinion mixed it all together and

866
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:23,109
it made a strain called a rise

867
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:24,759
I found three or four really great

868
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:26,740
phenotypes of the arize there's a very

869
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,359
golden goat reminiscent phenotype of a

870
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,460
rise I do not keep that one because I've

871
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,649
got golden goat it's too similar I get

872
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,740
rid of it there's one that's got this

873
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,179
sweet skunky funky you can't keep it in

874
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,890
a baggie without all your friends in

875
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:41,169
smoke some of that weed with me kind of

876
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,400
smell to it that's my favorite female of

877
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:45,250
the bunch then there's one that makes

878
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,538
really long skinny buds and I don't know

879
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,159
where it came from but it gives you this

880
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,629
hazy high I don't know where the haze

881
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,580
came from in the genetics but it just

882
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,250
makes your head melt your eyes just get

883
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:56,829
[ __ ] squinty you go dumb you just

884
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,819
start stuttering it's that phenotype is

885
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:00,369
great but you know there are three or

886
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,200
four key key phenotypes that I found I

887
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:04,148
have put all three of those phenotypes

888
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
not the golden goat dominant phenotype

889
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:08,589
but I've put my three favorite

890
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,360
phenotypes in a room with a male of this

891
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,009
same cultivar but the male of the same

892
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,648
strain from the same seed pack they're

893
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:16,538
all F wands so I put the F ones the male

894
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:18,250
and the female in a room this male I've

895
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:21,609
posted pictures up into my Instagram he

896
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,859
makes male flower clusters as long as my

897
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:25,359
arm which is very amazing for a male

898
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:26,558
plant to make buds like this it's

899
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,469
incredible it's got a little bit of

900
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,450
resin on it it smells very pungent it's

901
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,120
got a hint of vomit to the smell as a

902
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,798
breeder vomit is a good trait if you've

903
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,009
got a male plant that smells like vomit

904
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:40,418
or feet or a bar trash can

905
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:43,599
that is a good breeding plan that's

906
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:46,360
gonna pass on good good aromatic traits

907
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,889
so I've got that male and then I've got

908
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,719
let's see what else is in there there is

909
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,919
a golden goat female because I'm gonna

910
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,140
do a little bit of a golden goat

911
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,370
backcross there's a lemon skunk female

912
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,309
in there because I want to see what this

913
00:29:54,369 --> 00:30:00,069
arised does to the lemon skunk and there

914
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:02,678
is a grateful dog female so there are

915
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:04,928
multiple themed phenotypes of the arise

916
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,809
so there'd be a rise f2s coming out very

917
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,278
soon it'll be tested by a bunch of my

918
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:11,200
people before they're available to you

919
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,819
guys but a lot of people get to test

920
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,500
them out then there will be grateful dog

921
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,869
to arise which doesn't even have a name

922
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,730
there will be golden goat to arise which

923
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:20,709
would be like a golden goat backcross

924
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,960
kind of and then there'll be lemon skunk

925
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,200
cross to arise which who knows what

926
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,150
that's gonna do that's gonna be amazing

927
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,620
both of those plants make a lot of resin

928
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,809
both of those plants have a really nice

929
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:32,009
structure I really see a lot of great

930
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:34,589
things so I'm excited about that they

931
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:35,640
are currently the date today is I'm

932
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,619
pressing my button on my phone it's the

933
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,320
14th they went into flour on the 3rd so

934
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,909
they're 11 days in the mail plant is

935
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,289
getting big old balls

936
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,700
his balls are starting you know when the

937
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,409
male plant starts to flower out the

938
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,179
balls point up but now they're starting

939
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,830
to hang his nuts are starting to hang

940
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,360
which means within the next four to six

941
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:52,619
days I'm gonna have pollen coming out of

942
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,269
there which may be a little earlier than

943
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,619
I wanted so I'm gonna move him over to

944
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,289
another room to keep him away from the

945
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:00,329
girls because the girls their pistols

946
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,220
the little you guys call him Harris

947
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,329
probably the little white pistols the

948
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,960
hairs on the plant that looks like a

949
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,879
dandelion

950
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,919
I want those nice and thick and stout

951
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,690
before I put that pollen on there so I'm

952
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,610
gonna move this boy to another area just

953
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,529
to keep him from dust and his pollen on

954
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,969
these girls too early and then once I

955
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,069
see all the girls have their pistols

956
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,230
nice and hairy nice and furry

957
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:20,879
I'd almost that tarantula look then I'm

958
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,019
gonna bring the boy over there and I'm

959
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,490
gonna just leave him in the room with

960
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:24,839
them overnight and then in the morning

961
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,429
as soon as lights come on I might give

962
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,139
him a little shake and that pollen is

963
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,540
gonna dust all those plants and then I'm

964
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,429
gonna do that probably four or five days

965
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,178
again or four or five days later I'm

966
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,160
gonna do that again

967
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,090
just let the lights come on and walk in

968
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,558
there and give him a little bit of a

969
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:39,298
shake and just get that pollen all over

970
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,579
all those plants so when I see a little

971
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,798
bit of a shake guys if you grab a male

972
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,808
cannabis plant that is in full flower

973
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,548
that's got pollen sacs hanging off of it

974
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:49,678
you could flick it like listen to I'm

975
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:51,150
gonna flick the microphone stand that's

976
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,660
all you got to do you flick it that hard

977
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:56,160
pollen goes everywhere everywhere so

978
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,529
after that I'll have to take a shower

979
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,150
off to change clothes I'll have to go

980
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,190
spray down any female plants that I do

981
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,570
not want receiving pollen it'll it'll be

982
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,890
some work but it'll be definitely

983
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,720
definitely worth it I have to change

984
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,280
clothes wash my dreadlocks before I go

985
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,808
to anybody else's garden I wouldn't

986
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:12,000
disrespect anyone else's garden like

987
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:13,678
that I'll put on specific clothes they

988
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,079
cover me up most of the ways that I just

989
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,669
drop them right in the washer it's a

990
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,960
chore but that's where my breeding

991
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,490
project is you guys the male is just

992
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,079
getting ready to draw a polity I'm I

993
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,179
just kicked the dog Ian I'm sorry boy

994
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,798
I'm sorry dude I didn't mean to kick you

995
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,269
his heads right here on my foot so every

996
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:28,139
time I get excited I move my foot give

997
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:30,750
him a good head kick

998
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,300
this ain't no UFC over here I apologize

999
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,730
so my plants are the breeding project is

1000
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:37,440
11 days the males are just dropping

1001
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,089
pollen the male is just rot starting to

1002
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,680
drop on the females

1003
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:42,059
almost ready to take it I'm gonna

1004
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,730
separate them for a little bit just to

1005
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:46,289
put some tension in the room then I'm

1006
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,509
gonna reintroduce them together in a few

1007
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:50,579
days and then once they pollinate it's

1008
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:52,289
probably gonna be about six weeks before

1009
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:54,990
those seeds are ready for harvest I'm

1010
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:56,369
gonna let them go about seven I don't

1011
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,200
wanna let me go too long but I want them

1012
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:00,149
nice and done I want them hard then

1013
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,340
we'll cut down the plants we will set

1014
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,019
them all in individual areas over

1015
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,209
individual containers and just let them

1016
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,859
dry for a couple few days once they I

1017
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,720
will will pre trim them at that point

1018
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,889
will give them I will just take off all

1019
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,900
the big leaves when we cut them down

1020
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,550
most of the families will be gone so

1021
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
well dry it we'll hang them we'll let

1022
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:17,819
them dry and then you just take the

1023
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,710
plants and you cut basically cut one

1024
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:21,509
stick off and I put on rubber gloves and

1025
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,950
hold it over like a pie plate and just

1026
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:24,390
start crushing up the buds and you can

1027
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,980
just hear the seeds fall out it's like

1028
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,240
you're smoking old-school Mexican brick

1029
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,710
weed and all those seeds respond

1030
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,480
tainting to tainting to take they tink

1031
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,490
tink tink into the pie plate just

1032
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,349
crumble them up with my fingers and then

1033
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,849
I push all the weed up to one side and I

1034
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,959
tipped the pan and all the seeds roll

1035
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,029
down to the other side and I take those

1036
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,400
out put them in a jar it gets carefully

1037
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:42,930
labeled of what it is I leave the lid

1038
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,430
open for a couple few days just so that

1039
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,950
if there's any moisture in there that

1040
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,960
those seeds will try out so now I've got

1041
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,240
a mason jar full of well labeled seeds

1042
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,100
and then once I've got all of them I'll

1043
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,930
weigh the seeds get a good estimate of

1044
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:57,149
how many seeds I've got then I'll send a

1045
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,620
lot of those seeds out to friends of

1046
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,870

1047

1056
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,039

1058
