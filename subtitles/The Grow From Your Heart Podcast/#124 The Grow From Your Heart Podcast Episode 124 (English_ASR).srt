121
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,719
little offended bit no I'm just

122
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,689
wondering if we can be on the team this

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,789
early yeah okay the only reason you're

124
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,620
raised cuz see I wouldn't know I've had

125
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,779
long hair before but I never went red

126
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,788
since she's had to deal with some social

127
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:19,399
stigma already she's been harassed by

128
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:22,728
some oh yeah it's not when they went in

129
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:26,179
I only asked as I watched what happened

130
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:28,399
when dude got the dreadlocks warm for

131
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,769
like two festivals and then cut them out

132
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,758
I watched the community revolt around

133
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:36,288
them throwback to cut I don't know where

134
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,090
that came from that happened years ago

135
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,639
with college but yeah I would just seem

136
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,399

first and then came over too so like we

170
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,750

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,699
mean it was a nice break for a couple

174
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,379
days but yeah we definitely got a lot of

175
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,050
podcast listening in that's a lot of

176
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,790
podcast show a lot of stats moving for

177

guy's voice already like but yeah so uh

180
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,769
Chris and I weren't in Bobo blaster Co

181
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,989
and I were discussing about it the whole

182
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:31,120
time that you guys really needed to do a

183
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,879
show about the upcoming election and

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,949
that pro-marijuana people need to know

185
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,199
which candidate to vote for and which

186
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,000
one will actually help marijuana laws

187
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,349
get put in place instead of helping us

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,560
there you know making us take steps

189
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,180
backwards so yeah so a lot of my

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,699
questions here are about the upcoming

191
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,860
election so I guess my question to you

192
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,899
Mike is um what states look like they'll

193
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,080
be legalizing marijuana in the upcoming

194
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:59,349
election okay it's a little too early to

195
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,750
tell what the votes gonna look like come

196
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,610
November but we already know that a

197
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,759
number of states are gonna be voting on

198
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,860
legalization or we've got a good list of

199
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,240
states where there are major groups that

200
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,509
look like they've got a shot at getting

201
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,769
it on the ballot and in November or were

202
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,269
states where there's a legislative

203
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,199
effort to get it on the ballot in

204
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:21,810
November in those states or Arizona

205
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,389
California Florida Maine Massachusetts

206
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,180
Michigan Missouri Nevada Rhode Island

207
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:30,250
and Vermont may all be voting on

208
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,850
recreational marijuana this November

209
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,250
okay um States voting on just medical

210
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,750
Mississippi Missouri Nebraska North

211
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,929
Carolina in Ohio and that's a shitload

212
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,759
of states voting this November other

213
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,778
states could make the list there's still

214
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,629
plenty of time in most states for either

215
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,600
ballot initiative or for people to lobby

216
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,938
their legislators enough to get the vote

217
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,528
on the ballot in November this year wow

218
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:59,059
that is a lot of states actually I

219
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:01,159
wasn't expecting you to say that many

220
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,469
right that's why I had to make notes for

221
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,789
the first time I got mailed this list of

222
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,420
questions Jeff was talking about a

223
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,980
minute ago that nerdy part of my brain

224
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,509
got really excited and I was like this

225
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:18,709
is the show I've been wanting to do it

226
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:21,110
somebody did the landside wrecking the

227
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:24,409
other two paid a front and a back side

228
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,509
because I've got notes on each state's

229
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,578
effort to I just don't know how in depth

230
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:30,680
you want to go with this answer I mean

231
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:32,599
you can really give it to me that's fine

232
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,789
because I mean you know the Articles

233
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,259
that I want to write I wanted to do one

234
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,088
on each state so if you want to go

235

got to do our part you guys yeah alright

255
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,178
I'll step back ice we were at which

256
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,068
states are voting on legalization and I

257
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:35,958
was just about to run through a brief

258
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,549
little know on each or at least the

259
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:42,698
little note that I made looking these up

260
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:47,058
this afternoon this list came out in

261
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:48,678
December or January and already it's

262
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,719
only March but there's already been time

263
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:53,269
for another state to make this list and

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
I think possibly for one to drop off of

265
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:58,009
it

266
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,659
but back when this was this official

267
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,159
list that I kind of stashed was

268
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,870
published Arizona

269
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,448
folks there's a group collecting

270
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,589
signatures they need 150,000 signatures

271
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:14,490
by July 7th to make the 2016 vote in

272
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:17,399
November um the initiative includes home

273
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,839
gross so from what I could gather

274
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,809
they're gonna have a Colorado style

275
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,029
system that includes home grow not all

276
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,849
the states that are looking to vote on

277
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:28,799
legalization have home grow each state

278
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,439
has its own initiative it's an issue its

279
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,500
initiative comes with its own rules

280
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:36,480
we just Ohio vote on legalization and

281
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,028
vote against it mainly because of those

282
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,438
special rules they would have had

283
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:43,230
legalization they could have been

284
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:45,179
shopping in weed stores but chose not to

285
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,159
because of who was gonna profit the most

286
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,549
from the production end of that industry

287
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,750
um so if it's written specifically for a

288
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,909
bunch of people in your state to make

289
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,129
money it's probably not gonna pass um

290
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,838
California could go either way

291
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,480
California never shied away from

292
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,079
shooting itself in the foot here they

293
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,310
led the way with medical in 96 and that

294
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:14,758
existing industry has often worked

295
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,948
against legalization efforts there's a

296
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,269
huge black market in California that

297
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:20,938
also works against the legalization

298
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,620
efforts and then there's all the anti

299
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,179
pop people in some of the major anti

300
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,409
marijuana groups in the country or based

301
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:30,508
in California and all of that doesn't

302
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,129
bode well for either of the initiatives

303
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,620
in California that are being circulated

304
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:36,179
for signatures right now I think the

305
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,730
Shawn Parker backed initiative is

306
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,528
already for sure on the ballot and I

307
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,149
know that there's at least one other one

308
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:45,659
looking to be on the ballot competing

309
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,759
with it in Florida two different groups

310
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,009
are collecting signatures right now one

311
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,120
for medical marijuana one for full

312
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:56,579
legalization both initiatives look

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,068
really popular um get out and find

314
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:02,909
signatures people find a place to sign

315
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:05,870
and make sure you vote in November here

316
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:09,448
yeah we came really close last year like

317
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,778
stupidly close and you know it's funny

318
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:14,308
like I have friends in Florida who would

319
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,750
just complain about the fact that it

320
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,019
didn't get legalized and I'd be like oh

321
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,428
well

322
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,769
like who did you vote for in the black I

323
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:22,379
didn't like what right what you're

324
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:24,178
you're upset right like you actually got

325
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,369
to get out on Election Day it's really

326
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,928
not that hard not at all if you think

327
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,879
your vote doesn't matter the only way

328
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:33,738
your vote doesn't matter is if you don't

329
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:41,639
vote absolutely your yeah just [ __ ]

330
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:45,869
voting so that's Florida Maine Maine you

331
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:48,119
guys might be voting on legalization the

332
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:49,920
article I found on Maine didn't list

333
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,079
whether it was legislative or a ballot

334
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,118
initiative it kind of made it sound like

335
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,498
it was already on the ballot in 2016 but

336
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:59,519
if you live in Maine you need to google

337
00:13:55,499 --> 00:14:02,670
it Massachusetts legislative efforts are

338
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,379
underway for decriminalization that

339
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:05,818
would include legal possession so it

340
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,509
would be legal to possess a certain

341
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:10,528
amount of marijuana but it's just

342
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:14,519
decriminalization which means it's still

343
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:16,730
sold from a black-market no no taxes no

344
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,409
regulations no lab testing none of that

345
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,289
and there's a group in Massachusetts

346
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:24,318
looking to put full legalization on the

347
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,909
ballot and they're collecting signatures

348
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:30,208
in Michigan there's a group collecting

349
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:32,490
signatures for full legalization

350
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:35,609
including a 12 plant home grill which

351
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,919
will be double here in Colorado Michigan

352
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,949
folks I definitely look get out and find

353
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,318
a place to sign that petition Missouri

354
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:46,740
one groups collecting signatures for a

355
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:47,778
legalization effort they look pretty

356
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,889
good

357
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:52,139
but it's going to take people turning

358
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,899
out to vote for it in Nevada

359
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,639
legalization will be on the ballot those

360
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,720
folks in Missouri started sorry to jump

361
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,470
in there I know those folks in Missouri

362
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,548
shout-out to Daryl and his wife Trish

363
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,660
those are the folks running the movement

364
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,379
out there they went with them a couple

365
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,980
weeks ago

366
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:10,319
nice Rhode Island in Vermont

367
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,548
both have legislative efforts for

368
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:16,229
legalization underway and then I didn't

369
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,539
collect any detailed notes on the

370
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,959
medical efforts I'm surprised to see

371
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:25,078
Mississippi on there and Ohio still

372
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,269
reeling from that major loss last

373
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,039
November

374
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,799
it doesn't surprise me that they're

375
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:35,569
working on medical instead of another

376
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,159
Foley legalization effort yeah that's

377
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,530
those are the ones that are for sure

378
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,569
already have major legalization groups

379
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,389
or legislative efforts to legalize

380
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:47,100
marijuana if you heard your state on the

381
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,279
list you either need to get out and sign

382
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,960
that petition or hop on Google real

383
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,089
quick look up who your elected

384
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,220
representative is for your area for your

385
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,280
state legislature you need to give that

386
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,800
person to call or email them if you're

387
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,500
shy at all or email them it's super

388
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,409
super simple write them a little letter

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,190
and email dear mr. so-and-so I'm one of

390
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,350
your voters

391
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,510
I'd like you to vote YES on legalizing

392
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,279
marijuana that's all you have to say if

393
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:16,019
you want to get in and start making the

394
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,519
arguments for them and helping them with

395
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,039
that part of it too you can in your

396
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,710
email you don't have to be windy

397
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,240
hi mr. so-and-so please vote YES on this

398
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,280
thank you that's all you need to write

399
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,889
the more people they hear that from the

400
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,089
more likely they are to vote for you to

401
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:33,360
vote for what you're asking them to vote

402
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,830
for so take the time and do it if you're

403
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,330
a state where it's got you need the

404
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,180
signatures gathered to get it on the

405
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,889
ballot if the state requires a hundred

406
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:43,409
thousand signatures collect three

407
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,120
hundred thousand when you sign the

408
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:48,029
petition make sure that the petition

409
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,009
signer knows that [ __ ] I see efforts

410
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,350
fail to make the ballot every year

411
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,700
because they needed a hundred thousand

412
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,500
they turn it in fifty one hundred and

413
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,310
fifty thousand and then the state D

414
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:03,120
certifies 80 thousand and they're short

415
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:07,230
that's happening in Maine right now and

416
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,180
I think in Ohio as well so when you're

417
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,769
gathering signatures from marijuana you

418
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,299
need you need to gather triple the

419
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,769
signatures like it's incredibly

420
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,970
difficult to get this stuff on the

421
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:19,410
ballot for about an initiative but it's

422
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,360
doable if you do it right that's how

423
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,769
Colorado did it that's how a number of

424
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,109
the other legal and medical states have

425
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:28,079
done it

426
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:30,419
awesome that's really cool um so in this

427
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,000
upcoming election which candidates um

428
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,740
does it look like we'll have the most

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,200
positive influence on the cannabis

430
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,309
industry if they're elected into office

431
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,029
by far Bernie

432
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,799
by miles um a distant second would be

433
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:45,359
Hillary who will probably continue the

434
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,409
nonsense we're dealing with now from

435
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:53,219
Obama most of the Republican candidates

436
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,690
are either indifferent most are all of

437
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,579
the candidates at this point that it

438
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,440
outright said that they would use their

439
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,639
position as president to come in and

440
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,370
shut down what we're doing in Colorado

441
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,030
and Washington in Oregon I mean now

442
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:09,959
Alaska they're off they've dropped out

443
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:11,609
of the race so that's done we've gotten

444
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,140
past that point in this election that's

445
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:14,819
a really good thing to know that at this

446
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,440
point like none of the candidates that

447
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,299
are on there will try to shut it down

448
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,140
yeah well none of them have pledged to

449
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:24,119
so far okay given the nature of politics

450
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,280
that in especially this [ __ ] year

451
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,819
it's that saying that it hasn't happened

452
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,220
yet is a really safe bet god only knows

453
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:34,230
where the elections gonna go this year

454
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,640
if you thought politics were boring

455
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,700
you're not watching the right news shows

456
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't I can't say that I can't how

457
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,140
loud say that I endorse any specific

458
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,720
candidate by there but if you were going

459
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,310
to vote only based on cannabis you got a

460
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,650
vote on Bern one yeah that's definitely

461
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,359
who you'd go for you're gonna vote just

462
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,500
on cannabis laws that dude needs to go

463
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,299
to Grateful Dead shows that dude

464
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,460
protested something if if all those

465
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,559
images I've seen they're totally true

466
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,569
they've checked by major new media

467
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,329
outlets but here's the thing if you want

468
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:06,990
to vote for Bernie in November you need

469
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:09,689
to vote for Bernie now odds are your

470
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,839
state already had its primary caucus if

471
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,880
it hasn't yet your ass needs to get in

472
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,369
front of computer right now in Google

473
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,980
what you have to do to participate in

474
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:21,659
your caucus the odds are you're already

475
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,390
locked out because you didn't do this a

476
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,690
month ago but that's not true in like

477
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,580
half of the upcoming states or more so

478
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,230
if you want a chance to vote for Bernie

479
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:35,399
in November you need to get out and vote

480
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,599
for him now it just it has to happen for

481
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,610
him to get the Democratic nomination

482
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,019
it's gonna be a lot of work and a lot of

483
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:44,168
people turn it out who don't usually

484
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:46,119
turn out and that's your fan base that's

485
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:48,190
my fan base if you guys want to vote for

486
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,779
Bernie in November it's you got to get

487
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,470
out now all right

488
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,240
and some states have primary votes where

489
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,350
you just go vote like you do in November

490
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,509
um

491
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:59,949
each states different that's part of the

492
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:01,960
what you're googling to see how to

493
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,669
participate in it it's not hard it's not

494
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,110
difficult it won't be that big pain in

495
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,780
the ass and it'll have major

496
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:08,339
repercussions in November so get out and

497
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:10,960
do it

498
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:14,639
you can't [ __ ] if you don't vote no you

499
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,710
can't all right so we were talking about

500
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,659
the candidates that are most Pro

501
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:24,610
cannabis and we can all agree that it's

502
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:26,380
mr. Bernie Sanders so if Bernie gets

503
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,839
elected into office what does that mean

504
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,780
for legal we'd like across the nation

505
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:34,349
ah well his campaign pledge so far only

506
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:37,058
goes so far as to say he won't I

507
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:42,099
interrupt the experiments going on in

508
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:44,168
legal States he's very set against the

509
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:47,889
war on drugs I think he's talked about D

510
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:54,250
criminal or legalizing it federally on

511
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:56,110
the record this campaign it's as a

512
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,259
president he's got a couple of different

513
00:20:56,109 --> 00:21:01,839
options he could take the president

514
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:05,849
could sign an executive order which

515
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:08,259
would legalize it federally sort of

516
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:10,319
executive orders aren't federal law

517
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:12,460
necessarily like there's a lot of

518
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,099
contentious politics involved with

519
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,929
executive orders but the executive order

520
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,339
isn't a change in federal law that would

521
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,140
still mean marijuana is illegal

522
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:25,658
federally it's just the President signed

523
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:27,970
an order saying who don't care what we

524
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,940
really need to happen is in act of

525
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,279
Congress and where the who's president

526
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,169
matters there is because they get to a

527
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,849
bully pulpit is what they call it where

528
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,490
the president gets to say hey guys in

529
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:42,189
Congress it would be a really good idea

530
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,359
if you work on this and they do it all

531
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,308
the time with all kinds of different

532
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,599
[ __ ] and there's no reason they can't do

533
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:47,678
it with all right you guys we're gonna

534
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,199
figure out how to legalize marijuana

535
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,519
this year do this this and this get on

536
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,919
it

537
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,349
and like he doesn't get to tell them

538
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,340
like what to do like a your boss does it

539
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:01,538
work but it's similar with Obama they

540
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,980
just kind of look at him and nod their

541
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:05,798
heads and then half of the people

542
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,360
elected to represent us have chose to do

543
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:12,250
nothing for the last nine years and it's

544
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:14,589
been a [ __ ] problem but I getting

545
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:17,159
Bernie into the presidency and paying

546
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:20,788
attention to Senate races this year

547
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:23,080
major shifts in politics could happen

548
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:25,690
over half of our elected representatives

549
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,089
in Washington DC right now are up for

550
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,860
election if we fire that many of them

551
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,599
and replace them with quality quality

552
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:35,259
candidates that are even mildly Pro

553
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:45,359
cannabis 2016 could be a monumental year

554
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:47,440
for legal marijuana the podcast just

555
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,769
accidentally full-on endorsed Bernie

556
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,389
Sanders so if you're a pro marijuana

557
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,210
person that's the logical rational

558
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:57,250
choice yeah definitely so there's a lot

559
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,990
there's our yeah there are a lot of

560
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,339
arguments to be made after that but

561
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,048
right that's what you're looking at a

562
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,519
hundred percent is cannabis then you

563
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,980
that's where your money and vote would

564
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,769
go I'm very much not a one-issue voter

565
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,839
but marijuana legalization is very near

566
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,089
and dear to my heart

567
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:17,408
and I can see voting in an election like

568
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:20,769
this based purely on that my life is

569
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:23,789
ninety eight point seven percent funded

570
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:25,839
by the legalization of cannabis right

571
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:28,869
that's only like twenty five percent

572
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,759
true for me but like yeah that's zero

573
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:32,979
percent true for me but I did still like

574
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,440
a big aspect for why I'm voting to be

575
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,909
honest right it's I've studied this for

576
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,460
so long in just having it prohibit probe

577
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:45,340
prohibited just that concept in our law

578
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,639
has ruined so many things it's infected

579
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:50,648
every part of American life from

580
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:52,898
politics to medicine to how we interact

581
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:55,918
with each other our neighbors the police

582
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:59,709
how they how the police interact with us

583
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,778
it's it's just poisoned everything it's

584
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,850
touched and it's touched everything and

585
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:04,730
it has to stop and it stops this

586
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:07,750
election year

587
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,339
when people under 30 turn out and vote

588
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,559
which will hopefully happen a lot more

589
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,579
this year than it has in the past

590
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,980
election we've seen so many people

591
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:17,329
turning out for caucuses and voting Pro

592
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,829
Bernie in a lot of places

593
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,259
yeah we've been setting records for

594
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:22,849
caucus attendances attend caucus

595
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,289
attendance yeah

596
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:25,759
so it's there gonna be a lot of new

597
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,639
voters out there this year there are

598
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:31,549
there are more than usual energized but

599
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,350
we've seen this before if you're a

600
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:37,430
political junkie they refer to it as

601
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:38,629
getting Dukakis it's a guy who could

602
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,860
have been president and everybody

603
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,480
thought he was gonna be in all the

604
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:43,309
college kids were gonna vote for him and

605
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,980
then he lost in a [ __ ] landslide to a

606
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:51,319
nightmare of a Republican and it happens

607
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,420
Bernie's really really popular and he

608
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,909
could he could lose in a landslide to

609
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,680
the Republican nominee whoever that ends

610
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,210
up being godly don't let it be Trump and

611
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,680
he could lose to Hillary in the primary

612
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,380
and we could be voting Hillary versus

613
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,140
somebody and then what that means for

614
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,020
legalization is very different Trump

615
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,990
just is [ __ ] crazy dude I was gonna I

616
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:20,509

know everyone says this but like I've

619
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,590
already let it be very well known that I

620
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,490
will probably leave the United States I

621
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:34,639
have family in England I you've got a

622
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,529
lifeboat you gotta get out yeah I might

623
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,270
I might actually jump ship I mean I've

624
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,889
always wanted to go backpacking and like

625
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,569
do the Europe thing anyways so like

626
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,840
thanks for helping me make that decision

627
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:46,490
right yeah yeah I don't know what I'm

628
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,589
gonna do if that dude gets elected you

629
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,970
please yeah dude I'm gonna ride the boat

630
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,399
till it crumbles my life will change

631
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,120
that is an absolute thing yeah

632
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,530
absolutely

633
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,619
so I guess my next question actually

634
00:25:54,529 --> 00:26:00,710
goes to both of you then so

635
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:03,379
realistically um is legalizing marijuana

636
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,829
across the nation something we want to

637
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,370
see um I know for myself I can say yes

638
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:13,579
but I know that my reasons and I guess I

639
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:15,849
would rather hear both of yours don't go

640
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:20,428
far do you want me to take it first

641
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:25,599
I I'm happy to take it go for it yes

642
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:27,250
it's a great thing for legalization the

643
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,750
people who are doing it right are gonna

644
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,630
be able to do it right across the

645
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,058
country and the the people that want to

646
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,530
come in and take over or come in and

647
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:40,210
corporatize can't compete like I don't

648
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:41,649
know any beer drinkers who'd be pumped

649
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,840
if another's Coors Light came on the

650
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,120
market I know a lot of beer drinkers who

651
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:50,168
are pumped regularly about some small

652
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:52,719
craft brewery coming on market people

653
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:55,299
who build up quality and turnout quality

654
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,450
or what we need this industry federal

655
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:59,980
legalization opens up dude the lab

656
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,650
testing problem goes away overnight

657
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,169
right we can use the same labs to test

658
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,970
the cantaloupe design problem the

659
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,100
pesticide goes over it goes out

660
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,720
overnight immediately the pesticide

661
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:12,579
manufacturers are able to run the

662
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,798
studies needed to put cannabis on the

663
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:16,269
label all the ones that already know

664
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,668
they can because it's on the label for

665
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:22,058
tobacco will have those studies done in

666
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,320
hours all of the seizure studies would

667
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:25,418
be able to be done for the Uppsala

668
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,908
medical research and adults that have

669
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:29,620
epilepsy Hashem trips for Tots like I

670
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:31,630
get that Marv Rose gonna come in and

671
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:34,000
plant five or five hundred acres worth

672
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,320
of shitty weed and roll it up and throw

673
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,140
it on the shelf at six and a half

674
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,879
percent pre-rolled joints in a [ __ ]

675
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,530
little pack and it's gonna be cute and

676
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,179
it's gonna eat a part of the market for

677
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:45,339
people who don't know any better but I

678
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,690
don't care so do you think if it was too

679
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:49,629
much benefits if it's completely

680
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,190
federally legal and there are places and

681
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,419
I'm gonna compare it to the beer model

682
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,610
like you did there's a cannabis

683
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:58,720
manufacturer that's the same size as

684
00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:01,029
bush or Coors making producing mass

685
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,860
produce cannabis they're free cannabis

686
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,298
and then there's still niche Gardens

687
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:06,339
like green and healthy wellness and a

688
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:08,048
few others there are a few other shops

689
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:10,329
that I totally would shop and buy their

690
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:12,308
product right do you think that those

691
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:14,678
shops are still going to survive with

692
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:16,569
that large market like the Coors type of

693
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,450
stores that are coming out for sure okay

694
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:21,099
there'll be there'll be a section of

695
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,650
them they get bought up because women

696
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,689
Wynnum are lower occurs or [ __ ] those

697
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,059
companies but you go to I mean yeah when

698
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,009
they step in they don't create from the

699
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:31,480
ground up they look at you they

700
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,950
see what you're doing they hit you in

701
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,349
the face with a check bigger than you've

702
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,059
ever imagined and you walk away they

703
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:40,000
replicate your business model as a

704
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,309
franchise and then there's gonna be the

705
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,609
people who do this because they love it

706
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:48,159
they're gonna not sell out they're gonna

707
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:50,949
slowly expand there's a million people

708
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,160
who wish they could just hop on line and

709
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:57,880
order your seeds that can't because it's

710
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,950
not legal federally it's a federal

711
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,040
offense to mail those to people they

712
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,960
can't buy them like all that goes away

713
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,680
overnight people could just hop online

714
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,120
buy your seeds and enjoy life a lot of

715
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,230
percent legally without having to worry

716
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:16,359
about [ __ ] and the benefit for the

717
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,430
industry sky-high right now there was

718
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,469
just a report that the legal industries

719
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,110
worth four point four billion dollars

720
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,870
this year it's gonna grow to forty

721
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:29,289
billion dollars by 2020 if states

722
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:31,149
continue to legalize like they have the

723
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:32,859
last estimate I read on the black market

724
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,890
was Americans are spending sixty billion

725
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:38,019
on marijuana right now you figure a

726
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,920
third or more that's the black market

727
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:43,180
markup I mean the industry's worth forty

728
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,509
four forty five billion dollars

729
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,130
nationwide if you're able to export to

730
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:50,170
England every now and again or whatever

731
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,790
else is other countries start to

732
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,490
legalize in the demand for American

733
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,940
quality cannabis spreads around the

734
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,890
globe that growth is exponential the

735
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,240
idea that you're gonna get squeezed out

736
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,680
if you're good at what you're doing and

737
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,620
you're a competent business owner it's

738
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:09,970
just not there like you ever do a mic

739
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:11,459
drop I just like that's like the end of

740
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,049
the podcast right

741
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,029
that's why I want to choke the [ __ ]

742
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:18,009
stoners against legalization like I see

743
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:20,379
people every day online that are

744
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,420
actively lobbying against whatever

745
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,990
legalization efforts going on in their

746
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:30,250
area because it legalizes marijuana

747
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:34,059
somewhere in between alcohol and tobacco

748
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:36,009
not like tomatoes so like you can only

749
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,929
produce so much of it there are rules on

750
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:40,119
if you produce it in your home who you

751
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,259
can sell it to or give it away to or not

752
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,579
be allowed to sell it to that's

753
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,019
something I was gonna definitely

754
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,398
action is you got to be careful when

755
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,440
you're gonna make the it when it goes

756
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:50,408
federally illegal we have to be careful

757
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,298
about what we get like what we ask for

758
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,669
because there needs to be certain rules

759
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:56,109
about growing if we're all limited to

760
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,990
six plants that's gonna [ __ ] some things

761
00:30:56,109 --> 00:31:00,339
up we need usable numbers more viable

762
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,048
plant numbers we need just a little

763
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:03,220
better rule so when it comes time we

764
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,148
gotta be careful that we get the right

765
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,919
stuff that we want

766
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:07,839
it's so weird in Colorado right now

767
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,940
especially when we're extrapolating the

768
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,730
federal legalization because right now

769
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,058
those rules really help keep the idiots

770
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:19,569
from [ __ ] this up for all of us

771
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:23,369
already we've got major problems mostly

772
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:27,398
PR problems like nobody's been hurt but

773
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:28,569
massive outdoor grows we're okay so few

774
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:31,268
people have been heard that was fair

775
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:33,849
head shake but massive outdoor grows

776
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:35,200
that piss off the neighbors that lead to

777
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:36,939
articles in the press about what

778
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,850
bastards we are and how the system's

779
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,058
being manipulated all of that leads to

780
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,319
major blowback that has political

781
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:46,028
ramifications including our area

782
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,788
possibly voting to ban the legal

783
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:51,009
marijuana industry this November that's

784
00:31:48,788 --> 00:31:52,990
a real [ __ ] possibility mainly because

785
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,750
there's been a lot of blowback lately

786
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,839
about huge outdoor grows people with a

787
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,940
20 and 30 plant count doing 20 or 30 VW

788
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,709
bus size plants and a [ __ ] suburban

789
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,009
backyard like a douche bag yeah that's

790
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,569
not allow um nope and it pisses all the

791
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,638
neighbors off and it looks terrible in

792
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:11,200
the press and it's gonna lead to sick

793
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,879
kids losing out on their medicine

794
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,230
because caregivers are gonna get quashed

795
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,909
here in about five years

796
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,798
they're already pushing the caregiver

797
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:23,260
model out of the Colorado business plan

798
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:25,509
it's already going away yep and so it's

799
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:27,970
really time like if you care about

800
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:29,500
marijuana legalization or you want to be

801
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,409
part of this industry to really start

802
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,000
paying attention and getting involved

803
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:36,330
because right now everything is

804
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,190
happening it's actually becoming legal

805
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,990
everywhere very slowly but it's

806
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,649
happening like it's we're moving forward

807
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,538
every two years and if people turn out

808
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:50,469
and vote in the numbers that they can

809
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:53,319
Facebook post Bernie wins in a landslide

810
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:55,839
and huge numbers of congressmen get

811
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,409
replaced and we actually make major

812
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,179
problem

813
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,360
Ehsan marijuana law for the first time

814
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,799
federally in 80 years we can be a part

815
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,599
of that revolution all you got to do is

816
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,619
get out there and vote we already told

817
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:10,149
you who to vote for accidentally really

818
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,919
didn't intend to endorse a specific

819
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,170
candidate I'm gonna show but if you're

820
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,259
your only vote topic is marijuana you

821
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,850
really gotta vote for Bernie yeah well

822
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:21,119
so then I guess that uh that kind of

823
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:25,079
leads right there into my next question

824
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:28,989
what serious changes will occur if

825
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:31,779
Bernie a pro marijuana candidate is

826
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,910
elected into office like federally and

827
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,710
state wise obviously it'll change the

828
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,990
drug classification of it

829
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,890
which will mean that we'll be able to be

830
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:44,170
studied and all that the change at the

831
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,660
federal level is just so huge we will be

832
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,300
able to put our money in a bank yep yeah

833
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,360
we've spent 80 years thinking up ways to

834
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,220
make it harder to grow weed and every

835
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,639
single one of those rules is still in

836
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,769
place for the legal industry and

837
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,380
changing the federal law lets us change

838
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:04,690
all of those the banking the lab testing

839
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:08,500
the packaging requirements the state

840
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,000
line rules I I get five calls a week at

841
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,769
the shop about people wondering where

842
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,440
the Buy Now button is on our website

843
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:16,690
[Music]

844
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,340
like I I get it like you buy everything

845
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,139
online now like you're probably not

846
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,669
gonna be buying weed online now any time

847
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:26,319
soon but um it should be there like

848
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:29,139
everything else and it can be if it's

849
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,900
federally legal but just changing who

850
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,849
the president is it's sort of like the

851
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,668
first step and that's not how we get

852
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:40,150
this battle won necessarily that's

853
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:42,190
that's the next best step the real

854
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,980
change happens like regardless of who

855
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,409
gets elected the next election I'm

856
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,409
calling your state legislators calling

857
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,909
your state senators just google it

858
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,649
figure out who they are it's their job

859
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,909
to listen to [ __ ] when people call

860
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,190
and when you didn't Gamera it stuff

861
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,960
that's their job is for people that live

862
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,090
from whatever area the country they're

863
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,280
from call and talk to them and it's

864
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,350
their job to listen and then it's their

865
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,090
job to go pass laws based on how many

866
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,849
people call them that week and said vote

867
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:12,610
Yes or vote no so literally

868
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:16,179
this stuff matters there are a number of

869
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:18,700
areas cities towns counties that are

870
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:22,389
voting on marijuana legalization far

871
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:24,039
ahead of their states I just saw New

872
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:27,279
Orleans to criminalize that [ __ ]

873
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,389
Louisiana's never gonna but New Orleans

874
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,670
just passed a law

875
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:32,949
maybe not full decriminalization but

876
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,920
they just did some sentencing reform

877
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:37,809
guidelines I've been posting a story all

878
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,460
week of about a dude who got 13 years

879
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,099
for two joints in New Orleans

880
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,780
that's ridiculous yep it's part of

881
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,610
there's three strikes in your [ __ ] law

882
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,000
there's enough hash on this table to

883
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,400
lock up everyone in New Orleans yep

884
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,170
Miami Florida decriminalized it last

885
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,550
year didn't hurt this year earlier they

886
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,230
should think so yeah yeah I think

887
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,630
anything cities towns and counties

888
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,179
everywhere are and they're doing it

889
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:04,390
because the local officials in those

890
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:06,460
areas got swamped with pro marijuana

891
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:08,409
supporters calling hey I'm a voter in

892
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,500
your district I'm Pro marijuana let's

893
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:13,750
legalize it in the city enough people

894
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,159
call enough people got active and that's

895
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,230
what everybody listening to the show

896
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,649
needs to do if you live in another

897
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:22,360
country unless it's like North Korea

898
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,860
odds are you've got a system of

899
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,740
representative government of some sort

900
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,120
you can do a lot of this too because I

901
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,439
know we've got a listeners in Australia

902
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,759
if you're listening from North Korea

903
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,050
please send me a tweet seriously I'd

904
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,050
love to know if you're listening in

905
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,030
Korea my podcast on Twitter I want to

907
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,810
supporter in Australia I'm sure we've

908
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,910
got several but we've got one guy out

909
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:47,380
there that is a huge supporter what's up

910
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:50,529
my Rasta friend thanks for listening to

911
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,000
the show but yeah get involved get

912
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,800
active because there's a lot you can do

913
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,889
even on a local level if you live in a

914
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:01,860
state that's never gonna legalize it you

915
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:01,859
might live in a city that will Austin

916
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:08,710
so in your opinion out of the states

917
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:11,769
that have legalized marijuana already

918
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:15,610
which state is doing it right in the way

919
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:18,009
of laws like who has a good set of laws

920
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:22,180
put in place to make a cannabis industry

921
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:25,840
actually grow and not have issues none

922
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:28,000
of them are perfect yet but I tend to it

923
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,710
might be biased but I took a quick

924
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
glance at the rules again today and I

925
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,409
vote Colorado by a mile

926
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,269
Washington's drastically over taxing

927
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:40,019
marijuana and has caused all sorts of

928
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:42,670
price issues and issues industry-wide

929
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,400
between the city the state the county

930
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,070
the in the federal sales tax is that the

931
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,200
legal marijuana industry pays having a

932
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,780
statewide tax rate of thirty thirty five

933
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,849
percent is enough to keep the shop from

934
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,980
being able to profit at all and that's

935
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:59,380
terrible for the industry hips in on the

936
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,519
black market yep if the shops can't

937
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,780
profit they can't pay their people what

938
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,420
they're worth they can't provide

939
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,550
insurance they can't reinvest in their

940
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,980
business and there's no reason to get

941
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,660
involved in it just stay in the black

942
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:18,190
market the black market will be fine

943
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:20,618
just like it was last year it always

944
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,460
exists it's never going to look I mean

945
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,519
Oregon's got its own issues

946
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,949
your whole new set issues as yesterday

947
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:32,530
but Colorado is far from perfect to

948
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:36,608
weird social clubs are a very gray area

949
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:38,800
in our law some areas allow them no area

950
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:42,549
has shops up and running where they're

951
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,369
allowed Colorado Springs just voted to

952
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,230
ban all the shops but gave them eight

953
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,970
years to shut down which is a leave them

954
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,858
alone for eight years so yeah they're

955
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:52,539
too dangerous to allow to continue to

956
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:54,519
exist so they have to shut them down but

957
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,719
they gave them eight years actually they

958
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,789
actually said that they're going to vote

959
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,500
again within that eight years oh they're

960
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:02,019
probably gonna vote at least eight times

961
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,670
yes hopefully we can turn it around

962
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:06,099
there so when you guys are writing the

963
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:09,579
rules in your state or city or a county

964
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:11,019
or whatever it may be on your island in

965
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:13,569
your bubble when you're making the rules

966
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:16,538
for your cannabis laws be sure to

967
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,669
include some sort of way to consume

968
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,229
that cannabis legally and safely with

969
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:22,208
your friends there are places to go to

970
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:24,728
drink alcohol we can all go together I

971
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:26,528
can name 12 places within five minutes

972
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:28,389
of here that we can all go get drunk

973
00:39:26,528 --> 00:39:29,650
until we [ __ ] die yep but there's

974
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:31,239
nowhere that we get other than right

975
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,009
here at this table we can all congregate

976
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:37,389
and safely consume cannabis without any

977
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:39,099
problems we take it as kind of a given

978
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:42,608
but there's a huge contingent of people

979
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:46,798
out there that want no rules and they

980
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:50,288
think that's possible and it's not it's

981
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:52,809
marijuana might be the most safe

982
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,459
intoxicant known to mankind it might be

983
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,009
the most beneficial plant known to

984
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:59,708
mankind none of that means you're gonna

985
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:02,739
legalize it to be produced in the home

986
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:05,469
at any amount with no regulation or no

987
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:06,969
rules as to how or where it can be grown

988
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:10,749
like you'll never be able to grow it

989
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:13,059
like tomatoes at best you'll be able to

990
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:17,108
produce it like homebrew alcohol works

991
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:20,769
um and we need some of those rules

992
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:22,929
honestly with the abuses we see just in

993
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:25,508
the legal states that are going now like

994
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:27,729
there are idiots everywhere like and we

995
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:29,438
kinda have to set up the rules for the

996
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:31,478
slowest link you know what I mean like

997

eight thousand a pound and you've got

1008
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:56,379

1009
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:59,619

00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:00,069
you should just get in the car and take

1036
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:01,389
the biggest [ __ ] dab you've ever had

1037
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:10,960

1038
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:12,819
the kid but it was got more questions

1039
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,159
for white Mike there's a couple more

1040
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:20,860
questions on the list yeah I got the

1041
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:23,679
list also yeah okay so what other states

1042
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,470
um accept other states medical cards

1043
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,210
okay the only state that does they call

1044
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:30,730
that reciprocity the only state that I

1045
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,250
know that does that is Nevada okay and

1046
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,019
they accept all other states are just

1047
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,449
selected as far as I'm aware Nevada is

1048
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:39,400
medical marijuana dispensaries except

1049
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:42,099
medical marijuana cards from all other

1050
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,260
states which is great for the medical

1051
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,480
marijuana industry in Nevada because

1052
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,490
last I checked they had like 20 10 or

1053
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,050
14,000 patients that just changed a lot

1054
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:51,699

haven't wanted to go to Vegas we're

1070
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:30,010
drinking and legal weed or legal access

1071
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,289
to my medical marijuana should be more

1072
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,320
specific do you think do you think beach

1073
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:38,559
will improve your gambling Oh bye miles

1074
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,588
yeah that's yo yeah I'm not a drinkers

1075
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,239
that's what I was gonna say about

1076
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:43,518
smoking club's thing like that's a huge

1077
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,048
thing for me because I don't drink I

1078
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:46,998
haven't drank and maybe two or three

1079
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:48,559
years now like I don't really do

1080
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:50,268
anything else so smoking is really

1081
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,650
important to me and like being able to

1082
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:53,358
have somewhere to go and to do that is

1083
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,009
like really important so knowing that I

1084
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,298
can go to other states and like consume

1085
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,880
cannabis about having any issues or

1086
00:43:56,298 --> 00:44:00,679
anything is like a really I think it was

1087
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,690
Matt that said on a past episode that

1088
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:04,248
they made bars so that you don't have

1089
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,048
people drinking on the streets all day

1090
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:07,368
they need to make cannabis social clubs

1091
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:09,650
so that we're not out in our car trying

1092
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:12,499
to dab at the [ __ ] Safeway parking lot

1093
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:16,519
right and then we get a DUI right yep

1094
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:17,718
yeah yeah you know there's or some

1095
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:20,419
stupid [ __ ] right

1096
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,548
like legalization doesn't exist in a

1097
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,440
vacuum like it has to be practicing just

1098
00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:25,998
like everything else and there are a lot

1099
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,460
of people who live in places where they

1100
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:30,199
can't smoke there are a lot of people

1101
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,440
who live in situations where they can't

1102
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,449
smoke I'm about to be in one and it gets

1103
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,499
cold [ __ ] and collar out of there the

1104
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:41,058
winter and so you've you know you need

1105
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:42,498
places to go where you can legally

1106
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:44,259
consume you don't want to be standing

1107
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:46,699
out in an alley if you don't have to be

1108
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:48,139
and there's no reason to have that be

1109
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:51,078
the legal consumption method

1110
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:52,429
I [ __ ] hate tourists or Talent or is

1111
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,650
that just go to the back of the hotel

1112
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:57,440
parking lot like we should have a better

1113
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,479
answer than that right ah smoke out your

1114
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,150
car yeah I love the points that got made

1115
00:44:59,478 --> 00:45:05,298
on that show that last show of candy

1116
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:07,548
Canyon about like we've got kids now

1117
00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:09,259
like I don't necessarily want to explain

1118
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:12,440
that like I want to do that on my own

1119
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:13,960
time I don't want to have to explain

1120
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,969
that [ __ ] in the park or [ __ ]

1121
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,039
anywhere else like yes signs are one

1122
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,170
thing like what are those guys doing

1123
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,119
over there like that looks fun should we

1124
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,130
go do that dad like I want to skip those

1125
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,318
questions for as long as possible and if

1126
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,239
there are consumption clubs that

1127
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,929
conversationally comes up like that if

1128
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,818
I'm at a consumption Club yeah right and

1129
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,228
it's [ __ ] on me because I've got my

1130
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,150
twelve year old the consumption club

1131
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:40,578
like I'm the douchebag in that situation

1132
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:44,358
of the guys smoking weed you guys they

1133
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:50,210
will not let you have your 12 year old

1134
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:51,889
the bar just I'm gonna lay that out it's

1135
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,940
really got to be hard to telling people

1136
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:54,679
that about the whole

1137
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,019
tell because you're putting them at risk

1138
00:45:54,679 --> 00:46:00,049
too because if a cop were to catch them

1139
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:01,579
smoking out in the open they get you

1140
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,470
know they still get a fine or whatever

1141
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:05,660
it is here income we had a friend who

1142
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,309

1143
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:08,989
didn't have anywhere to be for a little

1144
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:11,150
while he parked underneath the stoplight

1145
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:12,379
or the just the lightness or a

1146
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,300
streetlight there and was chilling out

1147
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,099

1148
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,660
couple of puffs off the bowl as he was

window and knocked on his window he had

1151
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,669
no choice but to roll down the window

1152
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:23,989
and let the smoke billow onto the cops

1153
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,730
face and he just roll all he did was

1154
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,318

1156
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,170

1161
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:41,269
our buddy's fault 44s fall shout out to

1162
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,130
forty-four afraid but if there had been

1163
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:49,699
a place for him to go where he could

1164
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:51,170
safely consume cannabis 44 and two if

1165
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:53,598
there have been a place for him to like

1166
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,858
safely consume cannabis you know that

1167
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,050
wouldn't have happened that whole

1168
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:58,219
situation wouldn't happen for people

1169
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,990
that would have happened but for our

1170
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:04,909
friend 44 and two that still would have

1171
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:07,159
happened that way there should be more

1172
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:08,629
hotels that cater to the level of

1173
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,068
tourists coming through Colorado and

1174
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,180
they just that part of the industry

1175
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:14,329
hasn't caught up yet

1176
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:16,159
I mean come consumption Club saw a

1177
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:18,349
couple hundred different questions about

1178
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,568
how legal marijuana works there was a

1179
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,920
dispensary in Manitou Springs since the

1180
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:23,690
dispensary I work for is not a

1181
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,639
recreational store it's a medical only I

1182
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,010
can tell you about Emerald fields in

1183
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,568
Manitou Springs if you're gonna be in

1184
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,760
the Manitou Springs Colorado Springs

1185
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:33,170
area and you're looking for recreational

1186
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,700
cannabis I would send you to Emerald

1187
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,200
fields I like the vibe and the

1188
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:39,108
experience of the place it was unlike

1189
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,368
any other recreational dispensary I have

1190
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,710
ever been to the place was really

1191
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:43,970
[ __ ] cool had a neat vibe to it it's

1192
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,380
a little overpriced because it's

1193
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:47,209
recreational cannabis and I'm used to

1194
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,039
plant paying member pricing over at

1195
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,318
Green and healthy but the place was

1196
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,108
cooler [ __ ] check it out right down the

1197
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:56,119
street there is a 420 friendly hotel in

1198
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:57,318
Manitou they advertise that they are 420

1199
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,780

1273
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:45,379

Warwick has killer balconies there's

1275
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,530

1276
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:52,430

you guys ever been there okay so I

1279
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:02,119
visited Colorado twice before I moved

1280
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:05,269
out here and both times that I visited I

1281
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:07,130
tried to go there and like they don't

1282
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:10,460
open until noon or something like that

1283
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:13,039
so my overly excited woke up too early

1284
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,289
you know so I was not prepared for

1285
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,820
something to not be open till noon and I

1286
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:21,349
was not ready to wait to smoke a blunt

1287
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:23,660
so I said but anyways yes I have never

1288
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:27,409

1289
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:29,960
is a really chill like no entry fee

1290

1296
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:47,000
cities in Colorado there just if they

1297
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:48,619
were legal it'd be simple you know I

1298
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,590
shot out the can of Canyon all the time

1299
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:53,329
I really had fun at the dab lounge a

1300
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,070
couple of weekends ago with Steve de

1301
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:57,049
Fino doing the veteran farmers Alliance

1302
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,570
and then I went to this speakeasy

1303
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:01,460
that's the 4/20 speakeasy it's next door

1304
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,590
to the lazy lion it's a completely

1305
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,480
different vibe than both places it's got

1306
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:08,000
a big stage and there is a band plan and

1307
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,219
there are pool tables there are a lot of

1308
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,840
options I really enjoyed all three of

1309
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:13,459
those clubs on a different level I just

1310
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,570
prefer the candy cane Ian because it's

1311
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,639
got this

1312
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:18,980
hardwood floors leather couches this is

1313
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,659
classy as [ __ ] it's funny I always

1314
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,780
explain the smoking clubs in Colorado

1315
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:25,609
Springs if you're trying to go with

1316
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,500
people who you're trying to I wouldn't

1317
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,450
even say distract but there's a lot of

1318
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,860
TVs and a lot of things to do at the

1319
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:32,199
lion so you don't necessarily have to

1320
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,570
interact with people

1321
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:36,399
um the dad lounge is the same way right

1322
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,680
and but canna Canyon is where you go

1323
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,088
with your like true friends to like sit

1324
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:41,858
down and talk and actually have like a

1325
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:44,019
real conversation because there really

1326
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,460
isn't any TVs there's some music and

1327
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:47,440
stuff so you really go there for the

1328
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,420
atmosphere and the Cannabis everything

1329
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,970
music has kept it a real quiet level and

1330
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,230
yeah the hostess is usually Camille and

1331
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:56,139
she's amazing

1332
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:59,588
bring your bottles of water if you yeah

1333
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:01,239
right and like that's what I want what I

1334
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:04,328
hope to see like all over Colorado

1335
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:05,588
slowly start to spring up is places

1336
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,630
where people can go with their friends

1337
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:10,750
socialize a little bit consume some

1338
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:12,039
cannabis safely out of public view like

1339
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,349
away from people who aren't interested

1340
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:15,550
in it I mean it's just that simple it's

1341
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,960
some place to wait for the [ __ ] cab

1342
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,700
of the uber you know where people can

1343
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,929
safely consume cannabis and hang out

1344
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:22,179

like working Mike will be working sorry

1351
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:36,369
someone's got to do it bro yeah shot

1352
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:39,420
it's a Grammy Gatsby thanks for all the

1353
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:39,420
love bro I appreciate it

1354
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:45,400
we actually just confirmed our DJ I've

1355
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,659
been talking about the DJ that we might

1356
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,940
get we just confirmed it so I have to

1357
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:50,230
get permission from the people that are

1358
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,630
hosting the event before I can announce

1359
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:55,599
the DJ and confirm we've got it we've

1360
00:53:52,630 --> 00:54:00,000
got a good DJ I asked one of my favorite

1361
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,000
rappers to come rap and crickets

1362
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:19,950
I really think right at one hour I'm in

1363
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:22,300
that fine spot between two Deb did not

1364
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:24,068
either too high for this [ __ ] or not

1365
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,079
high enough for this [ __ ] so honestly

1366
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:27,759
the last three questions are what we had

1367
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:32,140
talked about that they're all shows in

1368
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,339
themselves so I don't mean we can do a

1369
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:35,588
round two of this what I think we should

1370
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:37,179
do is let the listeners listen to this

1371
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:39,009

regularly smack anti-marijuana people on

1441

Twitter and that gets you a bunch of

1442
