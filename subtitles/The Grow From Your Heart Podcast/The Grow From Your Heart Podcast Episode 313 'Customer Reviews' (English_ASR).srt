review I want to read was

66
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,350
left on March 15th by a person who calls

67
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,360
themselves Cobra I hope I said that

68
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:22,669
correctly the headline is amazing show

69
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,630
they gave me a five-star review and it

70
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:25,849
goes like this

71
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,949
listening to Jeff is fun educating and

72
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,930
compelling heartfelt comments with

73
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,149
incredibly educated commentary make this

74
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,969
show a must if you are interested in the

75
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,670
world of cannabis changing the world one

76
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:39,229
show at a time you know I may have read

77
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,549
that review before but that was a good

78
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,530
note so it's worth reading again if I

79
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,750
did so I guess the first thing I should

80
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,310
say is thanks for having fun and

81
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,689
learning with me I'm glad you find me

82
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,210
fun and I'm glad that you're learning

83
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,859
and that was exactly my goal so thanks a

84
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,540
lot for that and then thanks for saying

85
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,370
that I'm changing the world one show at

86
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:59,509
a time that is huge that means a lot to

87
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,460
me I did not realize the magnitude of

88
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:03,799
what I'm doing and I try not to think

89
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,420
about how big that is so I just try to

90
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,490
stay humbled and not think about that

91
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,389
stuff but thank you that does mean a lot

92
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,100
to me so thanks for the great

93
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,839
compliments thanks for the great

94
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,389

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,849
the 5 stars I'm trying to get my iPad to

96
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:18,619
open up the next review it goes like

97
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,569
this it's from a person who calls

98
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,300
themselves sweet chick Tennessee it was

99
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:25,519

100
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,439
informational then the review goes like

101
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,290

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
trying to give you great information and

105
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm trying to deliver it in a way that

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,189
sounds good I got good equipment I want

107
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,500
this to sound well produced and I want

108
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:44,000
to speak mostly clearly I know sometimes

109
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,680
I get carried away and I've got my own

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,419
personality and I speak the way I speak

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,460
but I try to be clear and I try to

112
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:51,109
enunciate and I try to give clear

113
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,460
instructions and explain things well and

114
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,370
I try to explain things in different

115
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,750
ways so that different thought processes

116
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,150
can absorb what I'm trying to say so

117
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,490
thanks for noticing that it's delivered

118

167
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,210
they need is some good advice I'm here

168
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,189
to do that so thanks for noticing that

169
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,250
I'm doing that for the community for

170
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,709
free also in an unbiased manner I do

171
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,329
have my own opinions and feelings and my

172
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:55,239
ideas of certain things I just try to

173
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:56,649
keep a lot of that out of the podcast my

174
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,538
opinion of a lot of things doesn't

175
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,099
matter to you what's going to make your

176
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:00,969
garden better what's gonna make your

177
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,039
life easier

178
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,070
what's going to help you increase your

179
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,750
yields or improve your potency or help

180
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,430
you medicate yourself more properly

181
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,259
that's what you want to hear from me you

182
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,780
don't want to hear about my crap so I

183
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,610
try to keep it unbiased if I do have an

184
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,189
opinion on something that is going to

185
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,780
affect the cannabis community I do try

186
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,089
to share that but I try not to be biased

187
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,369
I try to have an open mind and an open

188
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,538
heart in everything I do because when

189
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,430
you close your mind and you close your

190
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:29,978
heart you can't learn so I try to

191
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,959
deliver content in an unbiased manner I

192
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:34,149
try not to put too my own person too

193
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,589
much my own personal stuff into it if

194
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:37,719
you listen to the show a lot you'll know

195
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,848
I am biased I'm biased against Auto

196
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,390
flower seeds when I first started doing

197
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:43,670
the show three hundred and thirteen

198
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,620
episodes about four years ago I didn't

199
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,080
like support endorse or care for Auto

200
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,199
flowers at all but since I kept an open

201
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:55,159
mind and I listened to people now I kind

202
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:59,509
of find the the acceptable use the spot

203
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,010
for that product so I was biased and I

204
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,779
just had to learn how to kind of keep

205
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,399
some of that out of the show and if you

206
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,439
watch my Instagram live videos that's

207
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,879
where you'll get more of my opinions and

208
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:09,920
my feelings I just don't feel like

209
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,509
that's what a lot of you are here for I

210
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,449
do start the podcast off by talking

211
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:17,089
about my life sometimes but I try not to

212
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,310
bring too many of my beliefs or my

213
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,709
political ideas or too much of that kind

214
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,089
of stuff or brand loyalty I try not to

215
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,819
bring too much of that to the this

216
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:28,250
podcast of course business is business

217
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,829
and I'm a human so things are gonna come

218
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,870
through and without my personality this

219
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,639
podcast wouldn't be this podcast so I've

220
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,899
got to put myself into it but thank you

221
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,930
thank you for noticing that I try to

222
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:41,389
stay fair and unbiased I try not to I

223
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,250
try not to form opinions on new ideas

224
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,500
new products new methods or techniques

225
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,990
until I've actually had time to research

226
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,550
it and look at what I'm talking about I

227
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,590
try to keep an open mind so thanks for

228
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,870
noticing that the last line of this

229
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,959
customer review says Jeff is solely

230
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,530
responsible for 36.4 of all hugs given

231
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,389
to moms

232
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,399
hey that's pretty good I'll be

233
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,990
responsible for one third of all of the

234
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,629
hugs given to moms that's pretty awesome

235
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,310
I have definitely been blamed for a lot

236
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,399
worse things so that's something that I

237
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,959
can add to my resume responsible for

238
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,879
one-third or thirty six point four

239
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,529
percent of all hugs given to moms can I

240
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,850
claim that is that something I can put

241
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,369
on our resume can I put that on my

242
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,110
facebook profile I might add that hey

243
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,129

themselves madcap v2 the customer review

274
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,110
goes like this I've been listening for

275
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,629
about a month

276
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,300

277
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,820

278
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,059

Jeff hey thanks for listening for the

281
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,639
past month I'm glad you loved the show

282
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:37,009
the strain reviews what they're talking

283
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,659
about is I have done strain specific

284
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,578
episodes where I talk about strains that

285
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,819
I have bred we've done the morning dew

286
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:45,469
we did Firefly and we did the cream it

287
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,269
feels a little weird sitting here for 30

288
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,070
minutes talking about my own strains it

289
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,929
feels a little egotistical but since you

290
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,110
guys are asking for more that means I've

291

357
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,570
guys I promised that I had some emails

358
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,790
let's start right at the start of the

359
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,100
pile this one I don't know if they want

360
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,629
their name said it goes like this that

361
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,550
was a great Thursday quickie about

362
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:20,419
adapting with the plants and if you

363
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,039
don't know what that's from

364
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,599
he's referring to an episode I did a

365
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,059
couple of weeks ago about having to

366
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,649
adjust and adapt sometimes you're gonna

367
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,569
have to change your plans on the fly

368
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,829
sometimes things are gonna change in the

369
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,410
grow and you're going to have to pay

370
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,540
attention and adjust and adapt so thanks

371
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,610
for enjoying that episode the email

372
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,500
continues with I was going to send an

373
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,300
email to ask what I should do to make my

374
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,399
grow run perfectly with the new arise

375
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:45,469
and cream seeds that I just popped but

376
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,569
this podcast was right on point

377
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,278
great job Rasta Jeff keep up the good

378
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,120
work and let's get you on the Joe Rogan

379
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,769
podcast one day dude when I read that I

380
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,139
got intimidated I would love to go on

381
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,578
the Joe Rogan podcast I'm not sure what

382
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,769
I would talk about for three hours I'm

383
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,949
sure I'd come up with something but sure

384
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,230
let's do that maybe I could actually

385
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,850
live out one of these weird scenarios

386
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,220
I've been playing in my head you guys I

387
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,589
haven't eaten meat in about 18 years

388
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,220
I've been a vegetarian since around the

389
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:18,140
year 2000 it may be time for me to start

390
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,700
eating meat again I could explain but

391
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,019
just I'm getting skinny I'm getting

392
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,940
older and I'm getting skinnier I need

393
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:24,949
more energy I need to

394
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,110
who build instead of shrinking and I'm

395
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,570
approaching 40 so it may be time to add

396
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,159
me back into my diet I've been a

397
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,060
vegetarian for a lot of reasons for a

398
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,469
long time and it may be time I'm not

399
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,599
ready to go to the store and buy myself

400
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,889
a steak I'm definitely not gonna go to

401
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,379
some shitty restaurant and get a

402
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:46,669
half-assed piece of meat what I would do

403
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:50,269
is I would eat some of the elk harvested

404
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:52,429
by Joe Rogan I respect and Trust the way

405
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:54,230
that Joe Rogan harvests his meat I know

406
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,579
he does it ethically I know he does it

407
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,970
respectfully I know he doesn't

408
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:01,520
responsibly if Rogan were to take down

409
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,950
an elk and send me he may have to cook

410
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,779
it he may have to pre cook it for me put

411
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,780
it in his Yeti cooler do his fancy

412
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:10,309
cooking and then send it to me and give

413
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,889
me specific instructions on how to

414
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,059
reheat that [ __ ] properly or maybe I

415
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,250
could have one of my friends come over

416
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,689
and they can show me how to remind me

417
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,539
how to cook meat since I haven't done

418
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,120
that since the year 2000 but if Rogan

419
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,889
sent me an elk steak that was prepared

420
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,450
and all I had to do was warm it up or if

421
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,189
he sent me an elk steak that all I had

422
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,190
to do was cook it and he taught me how

423
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,560
to cook it you guys I would definitely

424
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,930
take a couple of fat bites and chew it

425
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,599
up and swallow it and give it like 10

426
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,879
minutes and see how I feel if it doesn't

427
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,149
kill me I'll probably more if it kills

428
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,029
me

429
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:45,470
I'm obviously not gonna eat more but

430
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,209
that's what I would like to do on the

431
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,160
Joe Rogan podcast if I were on there

432
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,650
also talk about cannabis also pitch my

433
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:56,029
show but that's kind of a weird scenario

434
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,769
it's not a bucket list thing because I

435
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,539
it's not something that I have to eat

436
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,309
elk with Rogan but it's an opportunity

437
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:03,740
that I would take if it were available

438
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:05,000
and I keep kind of I've tweeted it and

439
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,129
I've had a couple other people tweet

440
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,779
about it so maybe just maybe now that

441
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:12,049
I've said it on the show maybe that will

442
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:14,389
happen hey Rogan mr. Joe Rogan I fully

443
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,759
respect you and I love the way that you

444
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:19,789
hunt and represent hunters I've been a

445
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,259
vegetarian for 20 years my body is

446
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:23,740
indicating that it may be time to add

447
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:26,629
some animal protein back into my diet

448
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,360
powerful Joe Rogan it would be an honor

449
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:31,850
if I could break my nearly 20-year

450
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,460
streak of being a vegetarian by

451
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,320
consuming some of your fine elk steaks

452
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,860
my friend all right you guys I put that

453
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,989
out there

454
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,629
maybe joe rogan will hear that you never

455
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,429
know now I'm kind of on the spot what if

456
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,170
this does come up you guys anyway let's

457
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:47,149
keep going with his email I kind of got

458
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:49,159
off on a rant there there's one more

459
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,928
line left in this email it says that way

460
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,600
the whole world can tune in to your

461
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:54,980
expertise for cannabis knowledge hey

462
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,749
that would be awesome to get myself on

463
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,188
the Joe Rogan experience because he does

464
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,600
say some things about cannabis that

465
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:01,548
sometimes I'm like dude you need an

466
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,259
expert you need somebody to clear that

467
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:04,698
up cuz you just said some weird [ __ ] I

468
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,860
would like to be that guy

469
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,659
hey guys tweet Joe Rogan and tell him

470
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,249
that Rasta Jeff hasn't eaten meat in 20

471
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:12,980
years and that the only way I'm gonna

472
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:15,230
break my streak is if Rogan either

473
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,058
prepares and sends me some meat or just

474
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,829
sends me some meat with specific

475
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:20,600
instructions on how to prepare it for

476
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:22,669
myself I think this could be a fun

477
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,470
