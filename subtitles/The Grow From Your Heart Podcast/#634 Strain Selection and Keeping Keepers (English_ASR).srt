182
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,039
podcast episodes that i put on youtube

183
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,600
sometimes the text gets wonky

184
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,639
i put like visit the website i edit

185
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
those shows i make

186
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
pretty damn good sure that the things

187
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,680
are correct i try

188
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,079
real hard but sometimes i've noticed

189
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,079
that uh after the processing of the

190
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,680
video some things go weird in the video

191
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,879
processing and they don't post the way

192
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,918
that they looked on the screen

193
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,519
originally

194
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,519
uh thank you for letting me know that

195
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,319
sometimes i post stuff like support us

196
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,719
on pat

197
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,159
uh it should say support us on patreon

198
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
uh but i don't know what happened dude

199
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
there was an update on final cut pro

200
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
and some [ __ ] got weird and they fixed

201
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,639
it i think there's been another update

202
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
so we'll see

203
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
but it looks good on the screen when i

204
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,638
type it in i made sure like i double and

205
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,239
triple edit and then i watch it back

206
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,918
and then when i put it up on youtube i

207
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
guess it's happening when the file

208
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,279
processes and compresses anyway

209
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,879

210

333
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
i took some of those seeds and i passed

334
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,599
them to some friends ah billy podunk

335
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,519
got some of these seeds he got a five

336
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
pack of daybreaker f2s

337
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
it says i want to maintain this if it is

338
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
something i really like

339
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,839
but that is not something i normally do

340
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
so billy would like to

341
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,560
preserve and maintain these daybreaker

342
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,599
f2s but he's not normally

343
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,958
a clone cutting type of person i do

344
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
virtually no cloning

345
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,599
but i see that it is probably i see that

346
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,278
is probably

347
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
i get okay let me read that again

348
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,320
because i do virtually no cloning

349
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,359
but i assume that it is probably what i

350
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
will have to do

351
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,639
as a part of this project so i had to

352
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
edit you a little bit there but we made

353
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,199
it make sense

354
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
uh yeah it's always good to know how to

355
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
clone you have to get on top of your you

356
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,159
don't have to but i recommend

357
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,240
you get on top of your clone game learn

358
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,838
how to clone and rapid rooters

359
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
in little like the tray the rapid

360
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,920
rooters and the dome that's the most

361
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,519
affordable cost-effective simple way

362
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,199
if you want to spend some money on it

363
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,039
make it a science project get yourself

364
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
an easy cloner a turbo cloner

365
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,879
an aerocloner they're all basically the

366
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
same get a good quality product

367
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,000
uh and you can do that but i would

368
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,879
recommend strongly that you learn to

369
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,799
clone

370
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,078
what if what if you grow one of these

371
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,719
daybreaker f2s

372
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,319
and it is the perfect medicine for you

373
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
what if it makes you feel

374
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
uh perfect what if it fixes all of your

375
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,199
ailments

376
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,639
what if it makes everything that hurts

377
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,079
not hurt what if it makes all the sick

378
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,439
not sick what if it makes all the pain

379
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,958
not pain i think i said that

380
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
but what if this is the greatest herb

381
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,278
you've ever smoked you're really going

382
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
to wish you had another clone of it

383
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,958
because you're going to want to grow it

384
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
smoke it

385
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,000
and enjoy it and be pain-free again so i

386
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,759
recommend

387
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
learning how to clone that is something

388
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,559
i recommend in the beginning

389
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,759
once you get good at growing the next

390
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,599
thing you do is learn how to clone so

391
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,078
you can grow again but

392
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
um you're gonna have to learn to do that

393
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,000
it says i'm also open to making seeds

394
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
but i have not done that intentionally

395
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
before which makes me think maybe before

396
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
bro you may have made some accidental

397
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
seeds

398
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
i will be growing these in cocoa using

399
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,120
your feed schedule

400
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,959
what is your recommended approach to

401
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,879
this product ultimately i think i will

402
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,518
want to use these to make seeds at some

403
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,439
point

404
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,959
as i want to avoid using mother plants

405
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
for as long

406
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,199
as it will cut into my six plant limit

407
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
we can talk about that for a minute too

408
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,278
um once you find the keeper i would the

409
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,120
way i would go about this is i would

410
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,078
grow the five plants and find the keeper

411
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,759
out of there

412
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,799
find the male and the female because you

413
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,480
might want to breed with these but

414
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,039
definitely find the male keeper out of

415
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
there

416
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,319
learn how to clone it then you've only

417
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
got one plant working

418
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
as your mother plant you can cut uh

419
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,799
let's see you got six plants what i

420
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
would do is i would have a four or five

421
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,240
plant perpetual growth where you've got

422
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,039
one mother plant per se

423
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
you're taking clones off of that every

424
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,278
two

425
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
three four weeks however you set your

426
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,759
rhythm and then put a plant

427
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
in the veg room every two weeks let it

428
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,319
veg for

429
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,439
however long your cycle will set up a

430
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
cycle you know what i mean that fits

431
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
around your six plants and your size of

432
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,319
your space is really going to be

433
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
be key but always have plants in

434
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,920
rotations where one is two weeks in

435
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
one's four weeks in one is six weeks in

436
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,120
one is eight weeks in

437
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,959
and one gets chopped down today you

438
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
could set that up one mother plant

439
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,799
and five perpetual plants you could make

440
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,399
that happen cut down four plants have

441
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,000
one in veg at all times

442
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
you could set up that rhythm if you put

443
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,799
some strategy and thought into it

444
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,078
you got 70 day cycles divided by how

445
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,599
many numbers of plants

446
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,039
there you go that's how many days apart

447
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
your cycle should be how long do you

448
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,919
need to veg

449
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
it's really just a math equation where x

450
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,519
equals how long do i veg

451
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
y equals how many plants just do an

452
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,078
equation figure it out

453
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,000
but that's how you work around the

454
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,239
mother plant and the low count or

455
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
use that veg plant for a mother plant at

456
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,159
the same time while it's vegging

457
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,240
it's growing it's growing cut the top

458
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,679
off of it get the top cloning as soon as

459
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
that top makes roots

460
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,439
that plant has recovered by then from

461
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,278
the top and you can put that into flour

462
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
repeat that process grow that next [ __ ]

463
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,559
out real big top it

464
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,759
move it into flour grow that top out

465
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,399
move it put into flour you can keep

466
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,919
doing that

467
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,759
not have to waste a waste of mother

468
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,199
plant space all right

469
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,439
i said real quick on that one so let me

470
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,800
get back on track if i'm going to make

471
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,399
seeds

472
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,519
after going through what i have with

473
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,958
these plants is it possible or

474
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,120
worthwhile to make some smaller plants

475
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,078
all right let's not talk about that yet

476
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
my recommended approach the recommended

477
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,519
approach honestly is learn how to make

478
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,639
clones find a keeper and keep the best

479
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
female out of here

480
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,159
and turn that into like a production

481
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,839
female and make that happen so you can

482
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,759
grow that forever and ever

483
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
however you may want to preserve this we

484
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,480
talked in a previous episode about

485
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,759
preservation

486
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,079
uh then i would say find a male plant

487
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,519
in this pack of seeds a male you've only

488
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,000
got five to work with so you're gonna

489
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,480
find

490
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,039
two maybe three males find the male that

491
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
is short

492
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,480
squatty uh doesn't flower too quickly

493
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
and smells like

494
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
uh puke and mothballs is the one i would

495
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,000
go for find that male

496
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,838
find the girl that looks like what you

497
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
want find the girl of your choice out of

498
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
this pack of seeds

499
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,198
pollinate the two pull the seeds out of

500
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,919
there then you've got a bunch of seeds

501
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,838
that would be the quick easy way to go

502
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,799
about making more seeds and preserving

503
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,320
it breeding it

504
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,838
uh to get more seeds and that way you're

505
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,000
making f3 and you're going to narrow

506
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,079
down the traits that you're looking for

507
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,039
uh honestly to learn how to clone is the

508
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,799
way uh that you should go about this

509
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,480
and i can't say should i couldn't i

510
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,838
shouldn't should on you but

511
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,879
that's what i would do bro if you want

512
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
to be a great grower and have this

513
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,159
genetic around forever

514
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
cloning is the way to do it we talked in

515
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,198
the previous episode about making

516
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,879
feminized seeds as well

517
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,719
if you find that female that you really

518
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,838
like you can use the advice from the

519
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
last episode

520
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,760
to definitely make feminized seeds for

521
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,198
preservation of this

522
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,278
now there are more parts to this

523
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,278
question i want to talk about

524
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,639
if i'm going to make seeds after going

525
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,320
through what i have with these plants is

526
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
it possible or worthwhile

527
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
to make some smaller plants with a

528
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,958
shortened veg

529
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,278
period will that provide me with a

530
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,638
decent amount of seeds all right

531
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,759
the shorter veg period veg period is up

532
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,440
to you if you want something more

533
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,278
vigorous you just have to breed

534
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
things that are more vigorous find one

535
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,278
that veggies with

536
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,799
hyper vigor and breed to that that's how

537
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,480
you breed for the traits that you want

538
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,639
quicker veg quicker flower

539
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,879
find plants that veg quickly flower

540
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,560
quickly and breed to those that is how

541
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,559
to put that trait in the mix

542
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,638
then you'll make seeds find the next

543
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,479
generation find the seed in that batch

544
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
that does what you want keep reading

545
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
you'll isolate that trait dial in that

546
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,839
tree that's how you get to

547
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,359
quicker vegging quicker breeding it's

548
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
find the plant that does it and breed to

549
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
it

550
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,399
will that provide me with a decent

551
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,959
amount of seeds you can make a lot of

552
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,919
seeds off of a small plant yes

553
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,278
ah a one gallon pot with a female plant

554
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,958
that is pollinated at the right time

555
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,399
will net you plenty of seeds to play

556
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,278
with for the rest of your life if you

557
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
don't want to play them

558
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,078
sell them you'll have plenty of seeds um

559
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
do you have any pointers on these plants

560
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,039
as well as what you might think would

561
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
come out of the f3

562
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,919
generation i'm in the process of

563
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,399
planning this project and i want to make

564
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,240
sure

565
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,919
i'm in a position to take advantage of

566
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
these beans i really appreciate

567
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,360
the forethought and preparation into a

568
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,360
pack of seeds most people

569
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
uh they buy seeds and they start growing

570
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
them and once they're in a cup and

571
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,078
falling over then they get a book and

572
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,879
start asking how to grow so this is

573
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,239
great

574
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,320
shout out to billy podunk for having

575
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
some forethought here but

576
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
uh any pointers and what i think would

577
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
come out of the f3 if you breed with a

578
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,958
big

579
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,399
wide-leafed female and a short stocky

580
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,039
male and they both have that burnt

581
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,839
rubber

582
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,639
tennis balls vomit kind of a mothball

583
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,959
sort of a

584
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
aroma and flavor uh you'll make a

585
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,599
beautiful og

586
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,958
kush cross that is short squatty

587
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,399
uh if you get the right male that

588
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,679
flowers in the right time and the right

589
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
female that flowers in the right time

590
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,159
you could bring these down to nine weeks

591
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,240
and have a solid nine-week finisher

592
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
rock hard dense buds that smell like

593
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,078
feet and fuel

594
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,600
and just this nasty bar puke trash can

595
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,639
sort of thing that's what i would expect

596
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,798
from it

597
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
super potent put you in the couch sit

598
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,838
you on your ass that's what i would

599
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,599
expect from it honestly

600
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,198
if you do it right it's all about

601
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,639
selection though you could pick

602
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
totally different plants than me and

603
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
come out with a completely different

604
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,280
outcome

605
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,960
so it's all about that selection i hope

606
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,319
that's a real solid answer on that

607
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,319
i'm gonna skim this make sure i give you

608
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,639
an answer first part

609
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,038
learn how to clone bro the second part

610
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,240
find a male pollinate a female

611
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,240
make seeds or run a perpetual grow

612
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,919
where you're using the mother plant as

613
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
the veg plant at the same time that's

614
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,759
another way to do it

615
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,600
uh pointers for the f3 that's all about

616
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,960
selection short squatty plants with big

617
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,240
leaves is what i would go for on this

618
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
cross

619
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
um a lot of seeds you can make a lot of

620
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,519
seeds in small plants i also want to say

621
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,480
that i greatly appreciate your discord

622

650
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,320
obsessing over one of your discontinued

651
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,160
strains i wonder if there's a place i

652
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,918
might score some dub wise

653
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
seeds thanks again and keep up the

654
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,080
incredible work from billy po

don't think there's any left even in my

663

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
on auto watering

684
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,759

705
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,038
to cracker mike uh so my question

706
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,959
uh and you can use this on the show or

707
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,279
not bro it's on the show here we go

708
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,279
uh what watering system do you use or

709
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,119
have you use or can you recommend

710
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,279
or do you just build your own setups i'm

711
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,639
pretty handy but also a visual guy

712
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,639
uh that's the point of right there so

713
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,320
let's talk about that he also said

714
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
uh just to add i'm looking for a little

715
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,839
more automation watering feeding

716
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,360
he says i'm here to hand feed but i'd

717
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,959
love to so yeah that makes sense bro i

718
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,119
get it you're there to hand feed but

719
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
if we could automate feeding and focus

720
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,798
on cracking twisting popping

721
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,120
lollipopping defoliating scouting for

722
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,679
bugs uh yeah we could just do more [ __ ]

723
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,959
if we have

724
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,640
machines doing other [ __ ] i get it um

725
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,319
so let's talk about what i missed in a

726
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
previous episode talking about auto

727
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,038
watering and i did recap on this

728
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,839
just a little bit um if you want to

729
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,839
provide

730
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,918
a really simple solution for auto

731
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,599
watering you can build a really easy

732
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,679
auto watering system i talked about that

733
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,439
in a previous episode you got a pump

734
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,360
you got some tubing that goes to

735
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
basically a homemade manifold which goes

736
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,000
to spaghetti line

737
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,599
which goes to emitters which goes to the

738
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
pots you put that on a timer

739
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,798
ding ding water the plants right it's

740
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
pretty easy if you're a handy dude you

741
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,879
can knock that out no problem if you're

742
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
not

743
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,039
the super handiest construction worthy

744
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,080
uh maybe if you're accident prone maybe

745
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,000
if you're like me

746
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,599
and you know that there's a company out

747
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,079
there that spent a lot of time making a

748
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,240
product

749
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,839
researching it developing it finding the

750
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,000
[ __ ] mistakes and flaws and getting

751
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,439
it perfect and before they sold it to us

752
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,119
uh that's what i'd rather do than [ __ ]

753
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,880
around and try to build my own product i

754
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,079
make seeds i do podcasts i play the

755
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
drums i'm good at that

756
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,359
i'm not good at making auto watering

757
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,879
systems for my home grow

758
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,479
i can do it but i'm not there are other

759
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
people that can do that so

760
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
that's when i would go with the product

761
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,760
like an auto pot system

762
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
auto pots are a great system for

763
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,720
somebody who wants to just provide

764
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,200
themselves with a quick

765
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,839
auto watering system auto pots hempy

766
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,759
buckets

767
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,038
something like that are wonderful for

768
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,359
you so that's what i would recommend

769
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,960
shout out to our friends at autopot usa

770
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,479
give them a check out they don't sponsor

771
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,919
the show they are friends of mine i'm

772
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,558
not even using the products right now

773
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,960
but i've

774
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,079
been really thinking about it and really

775
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
considering

776
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,519
putting one room on auto pots and seeing

777
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
if i enjoy it because

778
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,359
the summer's coming and after a covid

779
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,319
summer this summer i'm not sitting

780
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,759
around all year

781
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,519
ah we're gonna go do some [ __ ] i don't

782
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,519
want to be here watering all the time

783
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,639
so some auto pots where i could get away

784
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,639
would be awesome

785
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
now that i've recommended the auto pots

786
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
something i must say

787
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,319
auto pots are [ __ ] awesome until you

788
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
knock over that reservoir don't knock

789
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,480
over the reservoir keep that thing full

790
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
keep it nutriented keep it ph balanced

791
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
maybe stir it

792
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,399
but don't knock it over because that's

793
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,159
the only time i've seen something go

794
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,280
wrong with the auto pot system we had a

795
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,720
friend knock over that thing you know

796
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,918
who you are bro big shout out i'm not

797
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,558
gonna say your name

798
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,400
uh but don't knock that [ __ ] over uh

799
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,119
once again they don't pay me to say that

800
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
but the auto pot system has been looking

801
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,038
like a great product

802
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,079
to me auto pots hempy buckets some sort

803
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,359
of sip system

804
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,199
is really easy it comes with all the

805
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,319
[ __ ] in the box also if you really

806
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,480
insist on building

807
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,720
an irrigation system they do make some

808
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
pre-designed irrigation systems you can

809
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,319
find them at your big box

810
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,519
hardware stores locally or if you're

811
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,200
smart enough you can just reverse

812
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,839
engineer that build it for everything

813
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,159
you need

814
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,240
again my advice i say this every time we

815
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,480
talk about auto watering systems

816
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,798
by a second pump if you plan on auto

817
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,880
watering and that's your reliable system

818
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,079
buy a second pump quite often that pump

819
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
will die uh

820
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,678
unexpectedly without warning it goes

821
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,038
pump pump pump

822
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,038
pump pump and then it makes this noise

823
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,119
and you're [ __ ] it doesn't warn you it

824
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,038
just dies they're done

825
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,158
so they seize up and they're over get a

826
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:54,879
backup because you don't want to be

827
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
watering

828
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,720
and have that's not the end of work bell

829
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,519

auto water you have to hand water if you

836
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,879
[ __ ] it up

837
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080

this one do they want their name said i

840
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000

841
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,200
name said so we're going to skip

842
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,400
that just to be safe it says jeff

843
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,159
i live where our longest day is only 13

844
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,519
hours long i already know where this is

845
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
going

846
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,200
which of your strains would you would do

847
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,439
okay with those

848
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,360
shorter days i'm worried that a lot of

849
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,840
stuff will sprout and almost immediately

850
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,158
go into flower yes you are accurate

851
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,119
um and to be quite honest with you a

852
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,120
hundred percent

853
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,639
honest and [ __ ] not lie to you at all

854
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,678
as a seed breeder i'd like to tell you i

855
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,240
got some [ __ ] that's going to work

856
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,640
perfectly for you but i do not

857
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
i breed and we're playing with these

858
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,799
words sativa and indica and all that

859
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,679
[ __ ] now

860
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,359
i breed sativa dominant thin-leaved

861
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,519
drug-type cultivars

862
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,399
that will flower very quickly in your

863
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,319
conditions

864
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
most of what i breed it will go into

865
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,599
flower and that you need something more

866
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,519
indica like more broad leaf more

867
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,959
mellowed out kind of stuff

868
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,038
my shit's not going to do that for you

869
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
my stuff will flower very

870
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,759
very quickly to be quite honest with you

871
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,759
uh it says i sure would love to run

872

um they said i'd love to run morning dew

876
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,000

grateful dog which is also a grateful

878
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,798
dead reference if

879
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,879
you're paying attention but i'll go with

880
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,519
whichever one will grow with

881
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,880
more equatorial type of light cycle

882
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,440
thanks brother

883
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,278
um yeah i wish i could sell you some

884
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,278
seeds bro but i don't want to lie to you

885
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,880
i've got a reputation to keep i've got a

886
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,440
friend to keep i've got a patron to keep

887
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,919
here

888
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,278
um i got a business to manage and i'm

889
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
more about keeping you guys as my

890
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,359
friends and being [ __ ] honest with

891
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,079
you that's

892
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,678
working really well for me uh i can lose

893
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,599
out on a seed sale and tell you that i

894
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,679
probably don't have what you want that's

895
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,798
quite honest you could buy some stuff

896
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
but keep it

897
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,720
indoors until it's time to flower like

898
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,000
keep it indoors under grow lights get it

899
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,519
big and then when you're ready to flip

900
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,558
it then go put it outside that's what i

901
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,798
would do but

902
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,319
honestly bro i don't have the product

903
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,879
for you i'm not even trying to be that

904
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,200
guy

905
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,720
uh but i don't want to rip you off uh

906
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,720
you're looking for ferraris bro and i

907
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,839
sell volkswagens which may be related

908
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
some are i don't know

909
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,599
i'm not a car guy that was a bad analogy

910
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,278
but most of what i've got is going to

911
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,399
flower pretty quickly outside it likes a

912
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,000
lot of light

913
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,759
as soon as soon as you get out there

914
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
it'll probably flip so my advice would

915
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,400
be to get something

916
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
veget indoors it's kind of late for that

917
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,080
now then put it out there when you're

918
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,278
ready to flip it but it sounds like you

919
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,399
could probably get

920
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,159
if you got i've never i've never said

921
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
this bro but you need autoflowers i

922
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,640
would run you don't need i would

923
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,120
recommend i would recommend

924
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
three runs of autoflowers in a summer uh

925
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,000
if your days are that short

926
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,278
you could probably bust out three runs

927
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
of autoflowers just put them out there

928
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,759
and get them going

929
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,519
you could probably do it at least two

930
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,278
runs of autos here you guys

931
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,480
is a good situation where autoflowers

932
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,240
come into play i talk a lot of [ __ ]

933
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,319
about autos i'm not a fan of them

934
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,278
i think they are um it's not that

935
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,278
they're inferior

936
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,880
i'd rather be able to veg and manipulate

937
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,159
my plants through their veg cycle for a

938
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,000
commercial production and get what i

939
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
want and then flour them when i'm ready

940
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,038
here we've got plants that are going to

941
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,480
flip on their own anyway so let's just

942
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:13,759
put autoflowers out there and maybe

943
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,278
that's what you want i'm not an

944
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,879
autoflower guy maybe the

945
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,159
short flowering cycle but you could pull

946
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
more of them is what i'm thinking you

947
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
get like three cycles um

948
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,319
you can get two cycles of regular

949
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,480
cannabis also out there probably but

950
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,480
honestly dude this uh my products aren't

951
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,200
gonna be the best products for you

952
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
maybe try the uh the fl the prana the

953
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
prana may be the one

954
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
that would work out there for you but i

955
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
really don't want to lie to you rip you

956
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,798
off take your money

957
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
and then you think those plants are

958
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:40,960
going to do well and they go into flower

959
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,440
and you call me and you're like hey

960
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,159
dreadlock [ __ ] you i don't need that so

961
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
um yeah straight up honesty is the best

962
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,799
policy right here

963
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,199
there is more if you happen to mention

964
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,398
me or my question this is what we need

965
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,038
please mention dtom

966
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,239
420 is my username on a lot of forums

967
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,558
and ig

968
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,159

969
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,480
dread on

970
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
shout out to our friend dtom420 for the

971
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,519
great question

972
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,119
uh and then it says i oh i replied with

973
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,158
i think most of my stuff

974
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,798
will flip early on you maybe try

975
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,399
sunkiss or prana so that was my

976
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,599
recommendation my advice

977
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,278
you guys i could have recommended

978
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,719
anything i actually recommended

979
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,079
autoflowers which is weird

980
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
uh just because they're still gonna

981
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,759
flower early on you but

982
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,038
but you'll be able to get more crops i

983
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,919
think if you're just pulling autoflowers

984
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,278
you can put them out there and they'll

985
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,679
flip right away and you pull more

986
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,599
i don't know that may be terrible advice

987
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,720
um i'm not an outdoor grower i'm not an

988
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,918
autoflower guy

989
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
i'm just guessing that maybe you could

990
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,799
pull more there's a reason why people do

991
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
the autos outdoors

992
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,240
i may have just talked out of my ass on

993
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,319
