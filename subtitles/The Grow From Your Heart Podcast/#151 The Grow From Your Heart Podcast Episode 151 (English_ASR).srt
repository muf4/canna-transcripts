100
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,739
before I get to that I want to talk a

101
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,180
little bit about my weekend ladies and

102
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,090
gentlemen I had a good friend bless me

103
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,430
with a front row ticket to reggae on the

104
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,509
rocks if you've never been front row

105
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,030
right down the rocks that's a damn

106
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,409
experience go check that out it's

107
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,489
different it's way different when you

108
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,709
got to state lines go for it I just

109
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,659
bought my first concert tickets to Red

110
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,170
Rocks today actually are we gonna see

111
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:45,030
I'm gonna see gez on the 22nd so I'm all

112
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:46,619
know I have no idea Mike and I were

113
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,409
discussing earlier that how we're in the

114
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,370
way different music than a lot of people

115
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,319
Mike's like 10 years older than

116
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,670
everybody he works with I probably I'm

117
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,459
the same age as Mike 10 years old

118
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,458
usually when I take over the radio work

119
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,070
that's been happening for a while

120
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,048
well that's funny because I had a front

121
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,419
row ticket and the headlining band was

122
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,519
Mike's favorite band which is 311 love

123
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,719
it guess how much of 311 I stuck around

124
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,140
for

125
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,949
not a second so the band that I wanted

126
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,539
to show I probably did I probably did

127
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:20,039
they set it off at Red Rocks that's one

128
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,620
of their favorite places to play that's

129
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,420
one of the best it is one of the best

130
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,850
venues in the country I am a spoiled

131
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,069
brat I've probably seen thirty Red Rocks

132
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,300
concerts and that's no joke probably 15

133
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,490
of them were widespread panic

134
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,639
I was working that night and I caught a

135
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,060
couple Facebook it was like I wish I was

136
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:43,740
there I remember that you would probably

137
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,600
had just left a lot yes so I get to see

138
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,379
I got to see Morgan Heritage that's most

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
of the people that listen to the podcast

140
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,339
frequently know that my favorite reggae

141
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,720
band currently it will change and does

142
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,189
just my taste change I'll here's

143
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,540
something that'll catch my attention but

144
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,009
Morgan heritage has been my favorite

145
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,710
reggae band for a couple a few months

146
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,550
here probably the past year or so they

147
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:04,319
were awesome they played at 4:45 I got

148
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,879
to catch most of their set they sounded

149
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,259
fantastic they played a bunch of new

150
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,269
[ __ ] that I didn't know which was kind

151
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,889
of cool I kind of wanted to hear some

152
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,329
familiar [ __ ] like you know you want to

153
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,879
hear your favorites but I also like

154
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,439
seeing them they do kind of a jam band

155
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,668
thing they start off with one song they

156
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,379
don't stop till about halfway through

157
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:21,180
they're said they just segue song to

158
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,639
song to song so that was kind of neat

159
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,100
that kind of did a medley what's your

160
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,750
favorite song by them Joe it really

161
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,780
depends on the mood I'm in that's a good

162
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:35,189
question right now like not like this

163
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:37,139
moment I'd probably throw on like Jah

164
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,969
seed is one of my favorite songs by them

165
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,469
but then strictly roots is also a good

166
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,970
one and then there's a bunch of like

167
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,640
remixes that they do because they're a

168
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,250
reggae artist so it's always don't put

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
out a single all the time but strictly

170
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,569
roots is a great one so I got to see

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,030
them they ended then I was in the front

172
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,439
row and I looked back toward the sound

173
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,819
booth just looking into the crowd and I

174
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,228
see one of the band members hanging out

175
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,490
I was like ah he's over there I was like

176
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:01,469
I'm not gonna go bug him but he's right

177
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,360
there and I turned around and his

178
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,150
brother Peter Morgan was walking right

179
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,889
past me and Peter Morgan is probably my

180
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,209
favorite reggae singer if I could sound

181
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,560
like anybody if I could sing like a

182
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,209
reggae artist and probably be Peter

183
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,500
Morgan I know that sounds really weird

184
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,180
cuz he's got a high-pitched kind of

185
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,100
voice he's kind of squeaky but that you

186
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,360
could [ __ ] sing and if I wanted if I

187
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,180
could sound like anybody probably be him

188
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,030
him or Ritchie Spice but uh it's just

189
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,470
the kind of reggae voice I wish I had

190
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,879
I know I don't let its cool but that

191
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,800
dude walked right past me so I just put

192
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,269
my hand on his shoulder and that dude is

193
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,710
beefy bro like you know any touched some

194
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,750
people they kind of move that do did not

195
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,069
move he's one stout [ __ ] Jamaican I

196
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,629
put my hand on his shoulder and I was

197
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,800
like bro thank you and he just turned

198
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,149
around looked me straight in my eyes and

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,189
he stuck out his right hand and he shook

200
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,629
my hand and he said respect and then he

201
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,800
kept on walking because he didn't want

202
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:44,000
to get mobbed you know if I would have

203
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,650
stood there for three seconds he would

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,730
have got crowded so he just kept not

205
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:49,789
moving so that was cool I got to meet

206
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,620

207
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,290
reggae on the rocks that was awesome so

208
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,000

209
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,160

214
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,680

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,229
[ __ ] old like all the dreadlocks are

quote me I've never eaten it because I'm

264
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:07,929
a vegetarian yeah yeah I would assume

265
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,879
you have to like cuz I mean cooking it

266
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:11,739
in the oil wouldn't do enough because

267
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,419
you were ready to tell the dosage it's

268
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,860
real crispy and it's coated in something

269
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,419
because I've he handed me some and gave

270
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,789
it to me but I just gave it to Bobo

271
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,949
blaster Co because I don't need bacon

272
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,299
when I told him that I'm a vegetarian he

273
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,070
kind of looked at me and he felt bad

274
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:26,349
that he had been offering me bacon he

275
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,410
felt like legitimately guilty like [ __ ]

276
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,940
I'm sorry man no it's cool man he goes

277
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:33,639

278
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,440
me a big-ass dad like a really like a

279
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,759
manly sized dad when I told him I soak

280
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,350

281
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:44,830

288
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:10,139

289
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:23,379
pre-rolled joints the weed was good yeah

290
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:24,939
stone from it these guys yeah one of

291
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,439
their managers is a very good friend of

292
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,940
mine and I trust that place because of

293
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,950
her so cuz I know she wouldn't represent

294
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,180
a place that wasn't I wasn't worth

295
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,470
representing she's got too big of a

296
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,089
heart so shout it's altitude that's

297
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,100
really cool it's great packaging this

298
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,009
new package is a pre-rolled joints of

299
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,529
quality joints oh yeah presume that you

300
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,950
know I don't know why a lot more

301
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,379
companies are

302
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,370
I like it it says sativa and indica on

303
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,230
the top that's rad

304
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,820

305
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,230
over at altitude I like that the first

306
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,450
place I saw that was a place called

307
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,759
pride in medicine in Denver but they

308
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,500
fell off on all the new rules came in a

309
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,990
couple of different places doing

310
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,970
something similar and I like the way

311
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:08,149
that this project turned out those are

312
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:11,060
sleep I get a chance to try just about

313
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,370
every product out there on the market

314
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:18,349
being able to travel the whole state oh

315
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:20,179
yeah I'm a sucker for name-brand and

316
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,199
marijuana you know I've tried to Snoop

317
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:27,289
Dogg but Willy I got to give a shout out

318
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:30,049
to him he's the his model he actually

319
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:34,399
grows his weed in house you know unlike

320
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:38,059
like Snoopy just comes to write a name

321
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,980
on the Strand likes Willy actually this

322
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:43,309
is his company grew it and I went to a

323
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,149
blue sea sky in Denver and they had a

324
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:50,179
little room set up at guitars albums

325
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:55,220
where he'd sign all kinds of merch and

337
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:36,439

339

it out and there's another pre roll tube

340
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:46,028
in there and it's like a Russian doll

341
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,709
trying to buy cannabis now exactly

349
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,960

turps but I have any edibles since my

351
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:16,310
experience at the CP I know I'm kind of

352
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:18,980
trying I'm trying to every time I know

353
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:20,089
I'm it's it's once I get on a streak I'm

354
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,889
really weirdin I like to stay on a

355
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,810
streak I don't know man I'm on a streak

356
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,490
I got five milligrams in the car yeah

357
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,959
whenever I pick a streak whatever I'm

358
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,700
doing I'm really stubborn so if I commit

359
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,870
to something then I just like to once I

360
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,759
made it like a week or two and I've

361
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,200
broken the desire or whatever then I'm

362
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,549
like it's easy let's just see how long I

363
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,680
can go on whatever I'm doing here

364
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,389
whether it's not eating meat which has

365
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,559
been 20-something years now or not

366
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:47,689
brushing my hair which has been almost

367
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:55,219

373
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,259
chocolates that we just got into the

374
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,299
shop that I just felt like trying so I

375
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,559
they come in a sample pack so I brought

376
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:20,479
the sample for us to play with

377
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,129
I had the person that got me those

378
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,539
regular on the rocks tickets that might

379
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,220
be her favorite edible that you brought

380
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:26,839
they're the tiramisu one there I had a

381
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,300
bunch of people asked before and that's

382
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,480
the one I plan on trying but you know

383
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:34,069
how I act for lemon G dad's that's how

384
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
she gets for those terrorists see there

385
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,180
edibles the packaging is impressive as

386
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,250
[ __ ] they're totally compliant with the

387
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,629
new rules - which I like is a lot of

388
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,450
stuff that I'm even that I'm getting

389
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:50,779
samples of right now isn't packaging its

390
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:54,230
yeah I think they just plans we really

391
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:56,029
get yeah and I I mean I haven't tried

392
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,980
one yet but so far packaging and

393
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,720
presentations at home run remember back

394
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,279
in the day when we had a dispensary and

395
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,960
the packaging was basically one of these

396
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,309
Ziploc bags with the product name and

397
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,509
written on it

398
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:12,569
literally places steal that sell weed in

399
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:15,629
baggies oh that's funny yeah we would

400
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,480
get the owners owner one of the owners

401
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:20,129
would walk in with a laundry or not you

402
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,080
know like the sweater storage bin the

403
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,629
big plastic bin for like under the bed

404
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,830
was one of those Tupperware things the

405
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,539
thing that a lot of people make an easy

406
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:33,300
cloner out of and it would be full of

407
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:35,099
like slices of banana bread individually

408
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,809
wrapped in ziplock bags with just a

409
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,779
piece of scotch tape taping the flap

410
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:43,109
down so it fit taut and that was what

411
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,579
went onto our shelves like yeah it was

412
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,840
exactly that and you know where they

413
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,910
stayed when we closed at the end of the

414
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,700
night right right there on that shelf

415
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:53,639
nothing get away there longer than like

416
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,800
three or four like he's glad like we've

417
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,240
advanced to where we are now because I

418
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
it's a good thing that the health

419
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,240
department is overseeing edible

420
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,859
production but I do I never pictured

421
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,500
something like the product I'm holding

422
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,960
in my hand I mean even three years ago

423
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,100
let alone five or seven it's like

424
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,590
something that you would get from a

425
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,360
really fine hot chocolate company

426
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,259
through the mail or something like I

427
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,950
figured the company that they get some

428
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:27,710
exotic friendship you know that's

429
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,710
probably just somebody making it up but

430
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,709
they've definitely got a high head

431
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:34,709
chocolatier working for him these are

432
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,509
impressively [ __ ] I've paid a lot of

433
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,060
money to give these two girlfriends

434
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:42,389
throughout my life it's just not

435
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,039
medicated I've paid the same amount for

436
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,649
these that I paid for unmedicated

437
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,909
chocolates more than one holiday so

438
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,870
since we're - I'm up let's give a let's

439
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:50,159
give him a quick shoutout they didn't

440
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,450
pay for any advertising but they seemed

441
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,539
to be the talk of the show for a couple

442
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,670
of seconds here Kota signature truffles

443
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,620
the signature truffles they're packaged

444
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,269
very nicely they come in a black box it

445
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,129
looks like a condom package three

446
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,569
different flip doesn't it looks like a

447
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,088
fancy condom box is what it makes me

448
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,100
pink

449
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,619
more than one person described it is

450
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:17,869
that so it's the logo it's not the box

451
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:23,028
it's the logo it makes a circle and it

452
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:25,519
yes but I had heard about these long

453
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:27,709
before I actually got um I got to see

454
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:42,288
them in person and one they were at the

455
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:43,820
shop Lindsey just threw a medium-sized

456
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:47,148
at me I'm gonna have to take this one

457
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:48,829
so something slows down for a second

458
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:53,569
just know that we're getting higher for

459
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:55,189
your do you guys dive in if you want one

460
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:59,778
the flavors are kind of listed on the

461
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:02,990
box here how many milligrams is each

462
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:04,970
piece each piece is ten milligrams so

463
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:11,269
it's only 60 so you guys can really dive

464
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:16,490
in and try a couple the starter step

465
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:20,089
keeping my streak I'm just gonna keep

466
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,609
thinking that infuse it with some acid

467
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:24,230
or some some THC how much does that

468
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:26,000
package cost if you're not an employee

469
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,599
at the dispensary I honestly don't know

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,398

price range it's about 23 okay worth it

474
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,640
worth it that's probably worth yeah if

475
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,720
you were a dude and you were in trouble

476

00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,658
about dads and chocolates and all that

500
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,659
[ __ ]

501
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,159
pretty much Mike called me similarly

502
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,990
today for Mike and I it might have been

503
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,860
early for most do folks is probably well

504
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,628
into your day I was just thinking to

505
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,058
myself I bet to this conversation happen

506
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:14,189
at 1:00 and I was still had an am

507
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:16,798
attached to it Mike's 59 and he's like

508
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,940
hey ah this is what's up this reporter

509
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,859
is looking for somebody to talk to

510
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,960
because there's this news story going on

511
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:24,388
and he's like would you like to speak

512
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,649
and I was like new and about two seconds

513
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,969
later my phone blew up with a whole

514
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,018
bunch of other people asking me would

515
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,058
you like to speak for us would you like

516
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,019
to speak for us cuz I'm well-spoken I

517
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:32,069
guess I'm well-known amongst the

518
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,179
cannabis community and they felt that

519
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,288
I'd be a good representative so sure

520
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,879
that's all the people that message me

521
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:38,190
and wanted me to contact this reporter

522
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:40,648
for hey that's cool I passed the baton

523
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,210
over to our buddy Mike because I don't

524
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:44,788
want to be on the news talking about

525
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,259
that I grow cannabis I just don't want

526
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:48,028
to do that so I let Mike do it and

527
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,960
Mike's well-spoken and eloquent and well

528
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:54,000
now there's a reason caregivers don't do

529
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,538
interviews yeah it's a really good

530
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,579
reason

531
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,859
Markowitz effect I didn't want to name

532
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,538
it on the show legitimately the

533
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,189
Berkowitz effect the one and only

534
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:05,278
caregiver in Colorado to really do an

535
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,769
interview paid for it severely yeah is

536
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:10,500
still paying for didn't in many very

537
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:15,120
real ways and it's been a lot of years

538
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,960
and in pueblos that means that we had no

539
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,849
caregiver advocates down here is sort of

540
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,240
for lack of a better candidate that

541
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,678
became me a long time ago thank you

542
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,980
you're welcome it's a fight that I care

543
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,040
about

544
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm caregivers have been part of

545
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:34,980
for more than a decade we've never been

546
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,329
part of the problem and I say we in a

547
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,150
very general term because I am NOT a

548
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,980
care giver but they're very much under

549
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,860
attack again right now in Colorado from

550
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,420
a number of different angles people

551
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,250
they're going after the doctors right

552
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,710
now and looking at plant counts there

553
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,920
every county is restricting the number

554
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,750
of plants you can grow in a home or

555
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,840
looking to limit the size and scope of

556
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:00,630
your garden for in one way or another if

557
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,970
it's not by plant count directly

558
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,740
it's a rough time I predicted a couple

559
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,870
years back that caregiving wouldn't be a

560
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,430
thing by 2020 we saw this happen in

561
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,869
Springs less than a year ago and now

562
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,539
that's basically the same rules are

563
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:14,759
trying to implement Springs are trying

564
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,519
to do here it's it's even more than that

565
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,379
they've already done it here and what

566
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,660
their what the what's going on right now

567
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,240
is our Board of County Commissioners is

568
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,880
talking about putting a question on the

569
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,910
vote this November on the ballot that

570
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,630
says should we go to the state and

571
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:39,150
continue to lobby for a statewide cap of

572
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:41,220
18 plants per house and even even if you

573
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,290
have a medical recommendation from your

574
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,579
doctor to grow an increased plant count

575
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,170
of say 60 plants the didn't [ __ ] your

576
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:54,089
medical card [ __ ] your needs [ __ ] your

577
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:55,259
condition yes roll this the new rules

578
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:58,049
that they're talking about wouldn't

579
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,059
affect the card that you get written it

580
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,349
would just affect your ability to grow

581
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,019
on that card okay

582
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:06,809
you'd be limited to that number of

583
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:10,049
plants unless you had a specific type of

584
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,549
property which I haven't just seemed to

585
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:13,409
find anywhere it's just not in a house

586
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,970
or a residence and because of what

587
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,279
caregivers are and what the other rules

588
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,140
around caregiving are in Colorado that

589
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,930
means you can't be a caregiver and have

590
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,100
more than 18 plants period because of

591
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,630
your caregiver you can't have a

592
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,809
storefront or a building or anything

593
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,790
like that you have to do it at your home

594
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:32,669
so essentially these new rules statewide

595
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:34,259
means no more caregivers and your

596
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,450
extended plant count card could still

597
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,710
exist and you just be excited assigning

598
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,410
that extended plant count to your

599
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,788
dispensary which feels like is what

600
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,080
they're trying to do with most of

601
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,128
the patients are trying to take away the

602
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,509
caregiver and send it all to a

603
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,798
dispensary so they can make some tax

604
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,079
money off of it and not worry about

605
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,118
what's actually needing to be taken care

606
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,019
of that's been the goal statewide for a

607
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:55,470
long time

608
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,659
caregivers have been the scapegoat for

609
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,589
all continued black market activity in

610
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:03,210
Colorado for the last eight years

611
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:05,009
anytime a home girl gets busted they're

612
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,970
like oh my god these medical rules are

613
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,759
so confusing

614
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,769
and I go back and reread the article in

615
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,919
the paper and it's that there was no

616
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:16,348
paperwork it wasn't a caregiver that was

617
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,330
breaking the rules or manipulating the

618
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:20,098
rules or hiding under the rules it was

619
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:22,048
just a black market grower that's been

620
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:24,479
here for forever doing what they've

621
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:27,058
always done the only thing that's

622
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:30,269
different is that caregivers also exist

623
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:33,148
in the same state but caregivers are the

624
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:36,839
public face of home growing and so they

625
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:38,969
take all that heat at the same time the

626
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,089
state has gotten a taste of recreational

627
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,868
taxes and they've gotten a real look at

628
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:47,638
the sales totals by volume in the Med

629
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:51,089
markets still eating up half of what

630
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:53,308
Colorado period is selling and they

631
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:56,398
would love to tax that at the higher

632
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:59,638
rate so medicals kind of under attack

633
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:01,319
under all fronts right now which is why

634
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:05,668
I'm telling people to register to vote

635
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:07,378
for eight months something then you can

636
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,869
clear up for a lot of Colorado folks

637
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:11,428
people in Colorado have this thing that

638
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:12,959
they think this since as an adult

639
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:14,909
they're allowed to grow six plants if

640
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,769
they get their basic six plow plant

641
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,450
medical marijuana card are you allowed

642
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,339
to grow your six + or six or are you

643
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,440
just limited at the original six it

644
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,108
depends on where you're living that is

645
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,679
confusing ash it it really really really

646
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:32,069
really okay so here in Pueblo it matters

647
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,499
city to County this city doesn't care

648
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,648
what your plant count is I worked

649
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:40,048
incredibly hard for a very long time to

650
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:43,878
make sure that the city of Pueblo did

651
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:46,858
not implement a plant count limit just

652
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:48,628
we found sympathetic ears inside city

653
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:51,749
government and myself and a caregiver

654
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:53,368
here in town who isn't willing to go on

655
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:55,230
the news but is willing to work with

656
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:57,658
city government people

657
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,089
managed to get them to hear reasoning

658
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,009
and not do a plant count limit so they

659
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,888
did a square footage limit and require

660
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:06,690
air filtration we couldn't get them to

661
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:09,209
hear reason on a number of other rules

662
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:13,500
they implemented that I don't support

663
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:15,899
nearly as much but in the county they've

664
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,480
already passed an 18 plan count limit

665
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:21,658
which means if you live in Pueblo County

666
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,298
versus City you're limited 18 plants

667
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,000
period if you live in a residential area

668
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,589
there are some exceptions to that and

669
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,609
you'll have to look up your specific

670
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:34,678
zoning your residence and then what the

671
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,048
specific rules are for that zoning

672
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,519
designation but before I could give you

673
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:42,960
a hard answer on that so yeah answer my

674
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,429
question because somebody came into the

675
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,960
dispensary the other day and told me

676
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:50,580
that Pablo was an 18 count County and I

677
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,700
was like what are you talking about I

678
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,960
was like no it's not mean is like yeah

679
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:03,240
it is he's like look it up and I was

680
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:06,259
like I remember that fight and there was

681
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,669
not much public support against it

682
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:10,950
carriers are really busy people this

683
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,409
state put the squeeze on them several

684
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,470
years ago with a couple of statewide

685
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:17,909
limitations that mean in practice

686
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,569
caregivers don't have a lot of free time

687
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:24,230
to lobby City Council's and when they do

688
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:26,700
they tend to get treated pretty badly

689
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,378
because they're there for one specific

690
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,419
issue they don't have six months to

691
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:33,619
learn how to play the insane game you're

692
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,389
required to play to do things like that

693
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:39,599
it's often unfortunate that the system

694
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:41,908
works that way but that's how it works

695
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,918
and so caregivers have had a rough go of

696
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,980
it in Colorado and it looks like one

697
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,419
maybe two more elections and they're

698
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,899
gonna be something that's in our history

699
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,840
books

700
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:53,339
we need caregivers so if you can really

701
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,808
do if you're a part of the vote make

702
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,579
sure that you wait for this to come up

703
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:59,538
on the ballot and you do not allow them

704
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,369
to limit our plant count to 18 plants

705
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:05,220
this is an example if you've got a four

706
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,709
by four train you've got one light it is

707
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,250
very feasible it makes a lot of sense to

708
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,890
run

709
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,119
sixty-four plants in that 4x4 tree that

710
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,190
sounds like a lot of plants right but

711
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,409
here's how you do it you cut 64 clones

712
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,450
as soon as they start popping fat roots

713
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,769
you put them in the 4x4 tray you put a

714
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,620
little capillary mat down for those

715
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,210
roots to grow into you do it's like a an

716
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,889
ebb and flow system you fill that tray

717
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,079
then you drain that tray every hour fill

718
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,580
it drain it fill it drain it you got 64

719
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,899
little plants and there you flower them

720
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,490
they're about six inches tall they

721
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,680
finish off about 12 inches tall and you

722
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,750
pull about 6 or 7 grams for a plan

723
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,549
that's a pound of weed but you got 64

724
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,470
plants you do the same thing with one

725
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,579
plant or four plants under 7 gallon pot

726
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,100
just depending on how long you want to

727
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,899
veg it it takes a lot longer it's way

728
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,480
easier to pull that pound of cannabis

729
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,670
for Mike's medicine with 64 tiny tiny

730
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,170
plants than it is with a whole bunch of

731
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,029
big pots and bigger plants that you have

732
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,519
to veg for a longer time so it makes a

733
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:58,079
lot of sense it's not like 64 plants is

734
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,639
not like cartel numbers kicking out

735
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,259
although that's way that's one pound

736
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,090
just one example

737
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,069
I mean people when they see something

738
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:08,339
like ninety nine plants is the state

739
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:10,049
limit they picture the plants they've

740
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:16,169
seen in the newspaper that are the size

741
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:18,119
of a Volkswagen bus the end they just

742
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,279
don't realize that immediately the

743
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,079
numbers cut in half because only half of

744
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,299
those planets can be flowering right

745
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,339
when you're talking about a caregiver

746
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,909
with that's growing ninety nine plants

747
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:33,839
it's often because their caregivers four

748
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:37,529
or five patients often five patients and

749
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,269
then themselves and each patient

750
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:42,690
requires two or three strands each

751
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:45,029
strain requires one or two moms when you

752
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,920
start dividing out over life cycles in

753
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,899
two different rooms all of a sudden

754
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,080
you're you're just struggling to stay

755
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,269
under 99 and you're barely producing

756
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,949
enough marijuana for just your patients

757
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,480
and if you want to run a seed pack to

758
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,400
find something new then you're really

759
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,930
already over numbers as soon as you pop

760
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,670
those ten and get them planned it gets

761
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:07,019
very complicated and when you're number

762
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:09,630
six it's it's in almost impossible you

763
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:14,250
you're basically left with plant a seed

764
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,620
pray it's female maybe keep one and

765
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,750
rotate five I mean it gets very

766
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:21,649
complicated quickly and

767
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:24,599
it's not productive and it doesn't do

768
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:27,538
anything to combat the things that

769
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,069
people that are writing these rules are

770
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,919
hoping it will it's not gonna do

771
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:33,480
anything to the illegal growers it's not

772
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,549
gonna do anything to the smell of

773
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,538
marijuana in neighborhoods move shitty

774
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:40,798
gross with no carbon filters it's just

775
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,808
gonna make life a lot harder for

776
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,579
patients who rely on caregivers for

777
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,779
medicine at a price they can afford

778
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:47,519
it's gonna force them to go to a

779
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:50,069
dispensary it's gonna force them to

780
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,168
maybe find a ride they don't have a ride

781
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:54,319
maybe they don't have time maybe they

782
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:57,240
don't have money because I know that

783
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,069
what if you've got a caregiver what you

784
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,900
are reimbursing your caregiver compared

785
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:04,019
to what you are paying at the dispensary

786
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:08,640
is a huge huge drastic difference the

787
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:11,279
difference is massive almost 50% yeah I

788
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,909
mean just the cost to the the patient is

789
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,230
50% at least so here's something that we

790
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,549
should think about Mike I've been your

791
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,759
caregiver for how long now so it's

792
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:23,908
probably 2010 ish give or take so six or

793
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:26,158
seven years I know your cannabis needs

794
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:27,480
very well I'd like to think yeah I've

795
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,100
watched you evolve into a little dabber

796
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,220
lately it's been kind of neat to see

797
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,839
it's a time saver I can name strain I

798
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,009
know which strains you like I know if I

799
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,240
walked into my garden I'd be like I

800
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,440
gotta throw a couple of these into the

801
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,359
room for Mike because he's gonna need

802
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,679
this in about 60 days I gotta get this

803
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,599
ready for him yep

804
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,890
Lindsey's a budtender she's a very good

805
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,658
bud tender she knows you but how much do

806
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:54,059
you know about Mike's cannabis needs

807
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:55,590
right now yeah nothing wrong with that

808
00:31:54,058 --> 00:32:02,759
that's not your job that's not your

809
00:31:55,589 --> 00:32:09,240
responsibility I'm assuming actually

810
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:11,190
that you need a variety but CBD yes it's

811
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,808
curse tonic when your streams I curse

812
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,808

gonna get that thing done but that's

815
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,230
exactly what I needed to do for me in

816
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,210
the evenings but we we're wandering

817
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,400
caregivers are important damn it

818
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,160
yeah but my point is that I know what

819
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,230
Mike needs know I have a schedule I've

820

821
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,710

824
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,059

829
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:53,250
supposed to know that but you don't know

830
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,720
that [ __ ] you're the you're gonna be the

831
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,490
one providing his cannabis if they

832
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,410
eliminate me from the chain and you're

833
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,730
gonna have to learn all of these people

834
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,750
that do not have a caregiver anymore

835
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,710
you're gonna have to try to learn their

836
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,750
medicine you're gonna have to try to

837
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,009
have that product on the shelf can they

838
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,890
grow it green and healthy wellness

839
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:09,779
supply those flowers that Mike needs the

840
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,580
juicy needs that I need that you need

841
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,720
the people in that room need people in

842
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:14,399
that house over there need can we

843
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,500
[ __ ] supply those specific flowers

844
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,210
like a caregiver can no because they

845
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,859
don't have that many mother plants and

846
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,200
they don't have the time the part of the

847
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,139
equation that really worries me isn't

848
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,420
really the part that affects me directly

849
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,310
a lot of the people that use the

850
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,269
caregiver system in Colorado are

851
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:35,159
consuming massive amounts of THC

852
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:38,460
concentrated oil and CBD concentrated

853
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,050
oil and in the medical or the rec market

854
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,500
this is gonna cost them hundreds of

855
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:46,680
dollars a day per dose when you price it

856
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:51,509
out recreational several hundred dollars

857
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:54,390
a day per dose two doses a day so you're

858
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:58,259
looking at twelve thirteen hundred per

859
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:01,170
day in medication and in the caregiver

860
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,240
market with the plant counts that are

861
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:09,720
under attack right now they're getting

862
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:11,519
that same dose at the same quality if

863
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:17,339
not better depending on the production

864
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:20,280
and in a far cheaper price pennies on

865
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,829
the dollar because of how its produced

866
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,130
and where it's produced they didn't need

867
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:27,750
the million dollar machine the two

868
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,390
million dollar building the hundred

869
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,099
thousand dollars in permits and so they

870
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:35,279
don't have to pass that on to the

871
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,750
epilepsy patients into the cancer

872
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,570
patients that are taking a thousand

873
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,880
milligrams of CBD twice a day or a

874
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,070
thousand milligrams of THC twice a day I

875
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,039
had a caregiver give me a

876
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:49,650
bottle that was I think 648 milligrams

877
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:59,420
of pure THC what would that cost me at a

878
00:34:49,650 --> 00:35:02,670
recreation 648 oh no way more than that

879
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:06,900
does your rec rec you're looking at

880
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:10,440
around sixty to ninety eight gram for

881
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:14,099
good for good like co2 oil if it was

882
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,150
pure CBD teacher a little bit CBD

883
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:22,159
tincture CT oil and THC I mean you're

884
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:26,700
still looking at maybe 300 bucks okay I

885
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:29,279
exchanged a 10 pack of seeds for that

886
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:31,409
team sure because it was a caregiver to

887
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,400
caregiver transaction for a child

888
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:36,179
um I mean recreationally that would have

889
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,010
cost a fortune

890
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:43,259
yeah for 160 milligrams you're looking

891
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,460
at I mean like 60 and I'm sure he would

892
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,840
have given it to me if I didn't even

893
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,309
offer him the seed pack in exchange

894
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,780
right I was like you get something you

895
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,549
know like there was stuff here so you

896
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,860
get stuff for my stuff it's how it works

897
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,870
um I mean the caregiver system is where

898
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,620
the people that really really need the

899
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,089
in high quality high dose medicines

900
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,089
that's where they get their their their

901
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,039
product if I have to I can deal with the

902
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:07,860
recreational market I've got a job I've

903
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,809
got access to enough cannabis product

904
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,510
selection to keep myself on my feet and

905
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:14,279
healthy enough to work but there are a

906
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,530
lot of people who can't say that in

907
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,960
Colorado that rely on caregivers and

908
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,720
that's why I don't mind standing up and

909
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,179
doing press or advocacy for caregivers

910
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,639
even though I'm not one I definitely

911
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:30,239
appreciate it oh I'm sure a lot of

912
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:35,789
people just don't want to be seen even

913
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:39,269
though it's more seen walking in to a

914
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:41,039
dispensary right to purchase it there's

915
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:42,599
still very much a stigma you can still

916
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,840
very much lose your job like the pork

917
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,839
chop

918
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,309
what's the ID yeah it's the same thing

919
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,539
as walking into the porn shop for some

920
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:56,289
people they just can't be seen doing

921
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:58,809
that yeah yeah I like hope somebody sees

922
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:03,730
me walking in there the porn shop or the

923
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:05,559
dispensary if they stalk to you and

924
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:27,010
watched you go know that you're gonna go

925
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:28,719
home and have a great day there's

926
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,560
definitely a stigma attached for a lot

927
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,618
of people I still run into irregularly I

928
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,869
run into customers who are from other

929
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,358
states who are like I can't use the ATM

930
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,160
in this building because my bank might

931
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:48,369
know that this address is where a pot

932
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:52,949
store also is that I mean like a handful

933
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:55,269
a day it's not rare well because in the

934
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:57,189
large parts of the rest of the country

935
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:00,099
doing what we're doing what we're

936
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,900
talking about at this table will land

937
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,088
your ass in jail for an incredibly long

938
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,829
period of time these delicious

939
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:08,469
chocolates we were just eating are like

940
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:18,279
a serious felony in some parts of the US

941
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:24,730
because in Texas concentrates in what

942
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:29,130
state well that's a great way to say

943
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:37,150
rolled your own cigarettes look I said I

944
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:40,900
used it for you talk a little more to

945
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:44,079
the mic for that I'm just gonna make

946
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,030
sure we get this part again okay I told

947
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,739
the cop I said well I'll use those for

948
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,510
[ __ ] so I don't get [ __ ] stains in my

949
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,149
underwear

950
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,130
coming up my [ __ ] and it still didn't

951
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,440
work I said in court too by the way

952
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:58,680
you know it's really embarrassing he

953
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,950
gave me 45 days in jail so 45 days of my

954
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:04,619
life was taken away oh these are rolling

955
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:07,769
rolling papers man I remember those days

956
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:10,259
though when when I was in band in like

957
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:12,119
seventh grade they told us to buy

958
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,890
rolling papers for something I don't

959
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,809
even remember what about the instruments

960
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:17,339
but the paper specifically was good for

961
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,469
something with the rap you read in it

962
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:22,680
yeah yeah I mean that's how little I

963
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:24,269
think a little bit but I remember the

964
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,739
speech in class they're like alright

965
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:28,349
what you're buying now is currently

966
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,419
contraband if law enforcement contacts

967
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,429
you about these you can explain that

968
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,170
it's for your instrument and that

969
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:35,519
hopefully you don't get a ticket for

970
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,159
having what we're telling you to have

971
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,659
and that was like 20 years ago and

972
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:47,969
there's still places in the country

973
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:50,489

medical and recreational we have

993
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:50,879
probably the highest dose CBD probably

994
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,769
on the market when you say obtain two

995
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,059
ones so you just drop these straight

996
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:55,469
into your drink and it dissolves and

997
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,210
then you drink it there's that that's

998
00:40:55,469 --> 00:41:00,029
the brand-new product

999
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,380
we don't have the the the brand newest

1000
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,050
scent on our shelves yeah just the

1001
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:07,230
Stratus pills I was pretty damn cool

1002
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:10,710
they're uh brand new product on the

1003
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:13,019
market last what six months yeah they've

1004
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,570
been in business for about a year but

1005
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:18,960
they exploded everywhere across the

1006
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,820
state about six months ago I really like

1007
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,099
them personally they're they're a great

1008
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,960
low-dose medication option their their

1009
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,190
CBD products are really convenient and

1010
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,829
they're available recreationally

1011
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:34,409
yes relationally around 100 milligrams

1012
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:37,829
and medically 3 different kinds the

1013
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:40,109
relax is like a it's a hybrid the

1014
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:54,690
energies the sativa and then we have

1015
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:56,700
also one asleep the sleep I get more

1016
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,579
feedback is it just real heavily

1017
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:01,859
activated THC a yeah okay that makes

1018
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:07,019
sense that makes no sense and these are

1019
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:08,640
sins absolutely he just medicated a

1020
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,230
Snapple yeah I watched him dropping

1021
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,879
people and shake it up as I could you

1022
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,949
got in there and he's like THC we

1023
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,930
discussed medicating my Mountain Dew and

1024
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:23,339
decided that was not safe around all

1025
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:26,839
this electrical equipment from what I

1026
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,840
understand you can medicate any beverage

1027
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:39,000
[Music]

1028
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:42,900
it works like a kind of okay and yeah it

1029
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,610
fills up and there is kind of a taste in

1030
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,220
like a carbonated beverage I can taste

1031
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:50,820
it but like in this tea and I've tried

1032
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:54,779
use as well there's not really a mild

1033
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:57,990
flavor yes nice mom for sure that the a

1034
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,150
lot of drinks have a heavy flavor so an

1035
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:01,829
option that I can a medicate whatever

1036
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,710
beverage I want without adding tincture

1037
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:07,650
which is always a little weird

1038
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,179
I do like sodas but you can taste that

1039
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,400
medicine you can

1040
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:13,769
demanda see and then they're also kind

1041
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,838
of we teach a stand out you know I like

1042
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:18,358
my head will like these kotas right here

1043
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,650
they don't have that right I'm not a

1044
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:21,779
horse I don't need to eat the flowers

1045
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:27,599

1046
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:28,800

00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:49,380
that for several years yeah yeah I'm

1100
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,849
looking at looking I'm at the end of the

1101
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,980
table guys and I'm looking down the

1102
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:59,009
table and I see at least eight

1103
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:01,409
mainstream cannabis companies I mean

1104
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:03,599
different companies products vastly

1105
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:06,538
different types of products yeah and

1106
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,240
just this afternoon I was reading an

1107
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:14,009
article that was saying Colorado doesn't

1108
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,419
have real legalization um it hurts their

1109
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:18,230
there are people that are gonna vote

1110
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:21,539
against legalization this November

1111
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,880
because they're worried they won't make

1112
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,339
enough money when their state ends up

1113
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,259
exactly like Colorado is now and it's

1114
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:30,509
insane I can't believe you'd have vote

1115
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:33,329
to risk going to jail and keeping it the

1116
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:41,608
way it is because of something silly

1117
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:43,710
like that there's a lot of change I was

1118
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:46,170
a black market grower for far too long

1119
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,210
and it's much more comfortable having

1120
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,460
shifted to having this badge around my

1121
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,588
neck all the time and knowing that what

1122
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,239
I'm doing is not shady you know what I

1123
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:55,739
mean like if I'm doing something I'm on

1124
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,139
a camera you can watch me all day this

1125
00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,028
is what I'm doing is where I was it's so

1126
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:04,578
much easier that way let's do run a bit

1127
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:04,579
but they hit pretty nice for a pre-roll

1128
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:12,509
just pack a bunch of cones

1129
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:16,528
I've made 900 pre-rolls and a shift

1130
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:19,469
before like after you pay I was just a

1131
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:22,130
monkey in the corner might spin that

1132
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:24,298
monkey me to buy also make sure that

1133
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,300
sure that they roll and burn a little

1134
00:47:24,298 --> 00:47:30,039
bit

1135
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:31,630
we're a judgmental crew the first bit a

1136
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,309
little bit I saw the first one Usain

1137
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,769
Bolt that first one could've ran the

1138
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:37,630
Olympics it was running so fast this one

1139
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,949
is kind of so you know sorry

1140
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:43,289
altitude we didn't mean it just

1141
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:43,289
completely bash you're pretty good I

1142
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:51,010
rolled worse when you're at a concert

1143
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,090
you're like I'm gonna fire up this joint

1144
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:58,770
you like the other side and then that

1145
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,769
part falls apart like this one just did

1146
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:11,380
yeah yeah yeah actually I couldn't

1147
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:16,930
smoked any weed the front row reggae on

1148
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:18,400
the rocks for a little walk and sneak

1149
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:20,579
off by the trees and smokey a little bit

1150
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,360

1151
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,889
reggae on the rocks

1152
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,090

1157
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,269
taking [ __ ] from everybody at reggae on

1158
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:35,589
the rocks but they were cool about it

1159
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:36,940
because they pull your pipe out or pull

1160
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,980
whatever you whatever they found they

1161

1163
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,089

1164
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,650
your car you're not bringing this in but

1165
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,180
when you come back if I find this on you

1166
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,380
again we have to call the cops like

1167
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:48,519

1168
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,289

1171
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:58,380
the past at least as long as your show

1172
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,970
the one little chickens like the pass

1173
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,559
it's just for the record pretty sure

1174
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:04,899
that one security guard lady was a

1175
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,519
prison guard by day or a prison guard by

1176
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,860

1177
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,690

that was a couple of years ago timers

1187
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:31,999
but right before that they'd really

1188
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:33,889
started looking at security and making

1189
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:37,129
some improvements inside it's a

1190
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:40,129
completely my first Red Rock Show I

1191
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:42,829
think was fish in ninety five six nine

1192
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,809
ninety five saw fish there and it was

1193
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:49,089
basically a hard judge of enya's

1194
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:49,089
security from the night fish play dude

1195
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:54,470
it was a it was a giant dirt field it

1196
00:49:52,278 --> 00:49:56,210
was a giant dirt and cactus and [ __ ]

1197
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:58,399
brush fire waiting to happen type of

1198
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,858
field and if we're a hippie wearing

1199
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,849
sandals it was just a big toe [ __ ]

1200
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:03,409
dirty spot

1201
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,630
I remember Red Rocks when I was a

1202
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:09,230
teenager and it wasn't just a concert it

1203
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:10,999
was an adventure it's still slightly an

1204
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:16,998
adventure if you're not into uphill if

1205
00:50:10,998 --> 00:50:18,169
you got weak legs and I kind of

1206
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,429
challenged myself a little bit I was

1207
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,789

1213

1344
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:11,838
tobacco people that I don't know how I

1345
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:15,200
grew up in tobacco farm land that's

1346

1348
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:21,949
what I mean he I'm sure he grew he

1349
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:23,509
raised tobacco my mama sit there tell me

1350
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:25,939
how she used to pick it was just five

1351
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:29,540
years old I just felt so bad for cuz

1352
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:31,400
this is some rough work yeah so uh I'm

1353
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:33,739
sure he's probably just threw a whole

1354
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,139
leaf in his mouth yeah it was pretty

1355
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:38,029
rugged I get really lit up when I smoke

1356
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:39,858
blunts something about that tobacco leaf

1357
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:46,430
just really makes me spin around and get

1358
00:57:39,858 --> 00:57:50,588
so I've barely been smoke joints I

1359
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:50,588

I've got all the flavors dive in stop it

1374
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,880
work I had the day off and I had to stop

1375
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:49,548
at work for something and I'd had people

1376
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,400
ask me for or asked me if we carry them

1377
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:54,588
and so I just grabbed both both kinds

1378
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,660
that we carried and brought them for fun

1379
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:59,179
dive in did you try that Monkey Bar

1380
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,588
not yet but it's on the do list they

1381
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:02,239
don't pay me to say this at all but that

1382
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:03,679
monkey bar from Incredibles is one of my

1383
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:14,479
very favorite edibles that's ever been

1384
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:17,690
made in my how much did you eat so yeah

1385
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:20,298
this is this is this is why I hit this

1386
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:23,700
twice within a 12 hour period I consumed

1387
00:59:20,298 --> 00:59:28,829
over 2,500 milligrams of edibles

1388
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:32,699
yeah yeah so I'm just taking a break I

1389
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:34,619
can't go over like 30 or 40 okay myself

1390
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:36,509
cuz you know like six or seven hundred

1391
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:41,760
was hard for me that was what I was

1392
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:45,480
going in and then I completely stage to

1393
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:49,109
you exciting movement a little bit i'm

1394
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:52,650
ralphing run right into a CI go real

1395
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:56,730
light with edibles to ten ten I don't

1396
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:58,349
really feel it just it makes symptom

1397
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,809
management significantly better that's

1398
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:03,329
what I like about the Stratis

1399
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:06,960
specifically but other stuff thirty

1400
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:10,859
twenty five thirty milligrams is fun any

1401
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:18,210
more than that and I'm like not fun in

1402
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:19,858
public high still high I was still high

1403
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,900
when I woke up my eyes I'm wearing my I

1404
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:23,880
read genetics logo shirt and this red

1405
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,318
print is dark dark red my eyes were that

1406
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:41,130
red yeah that's where you brother enjoy

1407
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:46,139
that you can see the bubbles isn't like

1408
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:47,940
alka-seltzer kinda to you we're gonna

1409
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:51,449
watch this happen I like to eat the

1410
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:54,210
smallest physical like thing with the

1411
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:56,969
highest milligram so like those oh it's

1412
01:00:54,210 --> 01:01:03,809
very similar this means the one gummies

1413
01:00:56,969 --> 01:01:05,939
that are 100 milligrams or that that's

1414
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:07,798
me all day I don't want to eat a whole

1415
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,539
bar and get a hundred milligrams I want

1416
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:11,670
to eat a hundred milligrams real fast

1417
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:13,980
I like the exact opposite thing about

1418
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:16,680
the five milligram goings because I can

1419
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,780
sit there and pop six of them and have

1420
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:22,469
that is like I'm gonna get really

1421
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:24,180
toasted dose and I actually get to like

1422
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:25,769
chew and enjoy the edible most of my

1423
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:27,808
gripe about edibles is they're delicious

1424
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:30,358
but now they're the size of your like

1425
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:33,150
thumb joint and you take one tiny little

1426
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:35,548
brownie bite in like I'm a big guy when

1427
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,220
I take a tiny bite of a brownie most of

1428
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:38,900
the rest of my body that's not true

1429
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:41,868
in that moment starts looking for more

1430
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,820
that [ __ ] browning and when all of

1431
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:47,210
the brownie has weed in it that can get

1432
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:48,740
dangerous fast but yeah that's why I

1433
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,389
like this is the lower dose stuff

1434
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,069
because I can have a couple pieces and

1435
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:53,750
enjoy because most of them are insanely

1436
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:56,180
good now I've got a new idea for an

1437
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,980
edible company let's sell let's just

1438
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,389
copy our favorite edibles and we'll sell

1439
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,858
those and then right alongside those

1440
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:03,170
we'll sell the same thing without any

1441
01:02:00,858 --> 01:02:04,608
THC in it it's people have been joking

1442
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,139
about it for a minute the first company

1443
01:02:04,608 --> 01:02:12,650
that does it well is gonna make it nice

1444
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:19,159
just one company that did that already

1445
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:21,019
that didn't have a lot of there's more

1446
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:22,429
than one company that does a larger

1447
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:25,969
piece they just don't do it in a

1448
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:28,549
multipack successfully they need to make

1449
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:30,559
like a dozen of cookies right and they

1450
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:32,390
need to have one packaged in the front

1451
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:53,679
of it and that one is a hundred

1452
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:53,679
milligrams just slowly

1453
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:04,220
only if everybody knows did you see

1454
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,539
somebody the secret session did me an

1455
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:07,098
edible and I passed it on and they

1456
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:08,509
looked completely offended I was like

1457
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,859
sorry I'm on a thing and they just look

1458
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:11,060
like that's cool but I mean what the

1459
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:19,969
[ __ ] why'd you give it away and so they

1460
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:21,409
giving it back like oh no wait I forgot

1461
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:31,549
sorry I'm not doing those drugs anymore

1462
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:33,649
here you go I'll do it again

1463
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,330
it's just I'm I'm just stubborn and it's

1464
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,858
funny it's more of a joke to me now that

1465
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:38,269
I haven't done eating any edible since

1466
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:39,858
this time it's secret session when I ate

1467
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:42,170
like twenty five hundred milligrams and

1468
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:44,509
then I tried to go to work it's just

1469
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:46,010
[ __ ] always eat too many edibles a

1470
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,410
secret stash and I swear to God every

1471
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,810
time we have the conversation like we're

1472
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,429
not gonna

1473
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:52,170
animals and I feel like the last two

1474
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:54,750
times you followed through on that

1475
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:59,430
obviously the last two times I have not

1476
01:03:54,750 --> 01:04:01,739
it was 9:30 at secret sesh and Bobo

1477
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:04,379
blaster Co Chris bought me a cookie and

1478
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:06,689
I was gonna bring this up I'm like

1479
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,269
eating the cookie it's like 9:30 night I

1480
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:11,760
have to open the shop the next day and

1481
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:14,190
the guy was like I'm eating it he's like

1482
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,390
yeah these cookies were like 300

1483
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,250
milligrams that's what I've been telling

1484
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:21,059
everybody he's like but realistically

1485
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:23,190
they might be like I was like I'm three

1486
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:27,269
for three thirds cooking I'm like I'm

1487
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:29,429
gonna finish it now doesn't matter now

1488
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:30,780
but like man I wish I would have known

1489
01:04:29,429 --> 01:04:33,839
that before I started eating X I would

1490
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:35,700
have only eaten a quarter or one of the

1491
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,350
things I like about the rec market over

1492
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:40,859
the Med and there's not a lot on that

1493
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:43,049
list but the the dosing and the lab

1494
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:45,510
testing them to perfection it's coming

1495
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:49,440
to the medical scene very it'll be there

1496
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:51,390
in less than a year probably but I heard

1497
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,099
November I was supposed to be July and

1498
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:57,480
then they said November so we have to

1499
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:58,710
built the labs yeah bringing creating

1500
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,119
this from the ground up which is like

1501
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:04,530
why we're joking about like different

1502
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:06,059
models for edible companies if we're

1503
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:08,910
really watching it happen in front of us

1504
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:11,730
it's fun I had the honor of giving

1505
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:13,799
Lindsey and her better half mr. Bobo

1506
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:24,990
Blaster Co a ride home from the secret

1507
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:29,250
session first of all that cookie killed

1508
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:31,529
me second of all I swear

1509
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,059
all right Jeff wanted to do a podcast on

1510
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:36,120

1512
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:42,029
smoking and I guess I had said I was

1513
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:44,069
gonna wait to do a damn and I've said no

1514
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:45,750

1515
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:47,610
was gonna wait so apparently we're all

1516
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,110
waiting for me to take it down I fell

1517
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,340
asleep in the back of the car and then I

1518
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:52,440
woke up and I was like all right I'm

1519

1520
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,800
awake and then Chris started trouble you

1521
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,970

1522

long story that'll be part two it gets

1738
