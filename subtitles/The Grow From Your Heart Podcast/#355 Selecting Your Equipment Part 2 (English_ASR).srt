3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,820
heart podcast thank you for joining me

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,558
this episode of the show is brought to

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,809
you by our friends at the hella dank

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,879
seed company if you need new genetics

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,070
for your garden I highly recommend the

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,630
hella dank seed company and you can find

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,910
them at dank seed dot store you guys

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,339
somebody has been smoking all of my

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,268
concentrates but I'm pretty sure it was

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,948
me

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,989
I've been going pretty quickly through

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,439
this blueberry citron fan brochure this

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,479
stuff is delicious I've described it as

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,058
oranges coated in sugar with a hint of

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,128
the purple Laffy Taffy maybe a hint of

18
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,750
blueberry in there it is blueberry and

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,179
Clementine so that would make total

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,159
sense it gives me a really nice head

21
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,079
buzz it keeps me nice and energized and

22
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,849
it certainly makes me nice and talkative

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,770
so it's great podcast Deb's

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,870
the only bad part is it tastes really

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,879
good so I always want to dab more of it

26
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,159
so it's almost gone the good part about

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,079
that is I'll open a fresh concentrate on

28
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,140
the next episode and we will get to talk

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,879
about a brand new flavor alright in this

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,250
episode we're gonna get back on track

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,618
with the grow lessons this will be the

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,540
fourth episode in a long series of grow

33
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,549
lessons that will take us from the

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,799
beginning of a grow all the way to the

35
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,540
end we've already done planning your

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,520
grow we've worked on selecting your grow

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,200
space we also talked a lot about

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,908
planning your equipment we talked a lot

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,920
about planning your lighting your air

40
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,290
conditioning and how to handle air flow

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,060
now in this episode we're gonna talk a

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,040
little bit about how to control all of

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,560
that stuff and what to plug all of those

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,920
things into so let's jump right into

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,210
selecting your equipment part two the

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,340
first thing we'll probably need to think

47
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,989
about is what are we going to plug the

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,719
light into sure you can plug it directly

49
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,289
into the wall now it's gonna be on 24

50
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,438
hours a day

51
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,990
don't rely on yourself or your high

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,349
roommate or maybe your girlfriend

53
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:57,239
don't rely on anybody but technology to

54
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,309
turn that light off and on at the same

55
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,218
time every day we need consistent light

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,829
control so let's talk about a controller

57
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,289
for that light the easiest route to go

58
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,359
is just a basic on/off timer that you

59
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,360
can program to be on from a certain time

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,400
and off at another time I recommend

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,590
timers I like a timer with the battery

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,860
back up think about this you've got an

63
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,509
analog timer an analog timer you plug it

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,880
in and you spin it to the correct time

65
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,319
and then you push pins down for when you

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,699
want the light to come on and then you

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,709
leave pins up for when you want the

68
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,449
light to go off now you set it to the

69
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,939
correct time and while it's plugged in

70
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:35,589
that dial spins and then when the time

71
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,090
comes it clicks the lights to the

72
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,219
appropriate on or off and then it keeps

73
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,039
spinning if you have a power

74
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:44,949
interruption that timer stops spinning

75
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,629
so whatever time the power goes out that

76
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,639
timer thinks it's that time if it goes

77
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,680
out at 3 o'clock it's always 3 o'clock

78
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,689
until the electricity comes back then it

79
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,099
starts back up at 3 o'clock the lights

80
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,800
will come on they'll run until they're

81
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,500
programmed off cycle if you have a

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,230
digital timer with a battery back up if

83
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,360
you have a power failure the power goes

84
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,159
out at 3 your clock and your timer keeps

85
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,350
ticking so when the lights come back on

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,870
your grow room is still on the regular

87
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,219
schedule and your lights yes you did get

88
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,870
that dark period from the light

89
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,729
interruption but you were now back on

90
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,409
your regular gross Eiko so you're not

91
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,750
gonna throw your whole grow system off

92
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,370
so I recommend if you're going to buy a

93
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,379
basic plug-in timer

94
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,140
I recommend a digital timer with a

95
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,509
battery backup also make sure you get a

96
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,669
timer that is rated to support enough

97
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,459
amperage or voltage for your grow light

98
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,229
so for one light a small plug in timer

99
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,180
it goes straight into the wall you set

100
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,369
the time on that timer you set your off

101
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,620
and on scheduled times and the light

102
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,750
will go off and on when you expect it to

103
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,750
for one light that's a really easy basic

104
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,870
setup you can plug 1,000 watt into that

105
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,299
with no problem in most homes or they do

106
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,640
make another timer that has two outlets

107
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,459
on it with that timer you can plug in

108
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,279
probably two six hundreds definitely two

109
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,650
for hundreds maybe in a 4 and a 6 but I

110
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,169
would not recommend attempting to plug

111
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,909
in 2,000 watts unless you've done some

112
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:09,189
electrical upgrades in that home that

113
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:11,590
will flip the breaker if you try to plug

114
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:13,539
in 2000 watt lights into one outlet

115
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,680
without any upgrades you're gonna flip

116
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,180
the breaker I know I've said that a

117
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,410
couple of times in these episodes but I

118
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,728
want you to keep that in mind when

119
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,130
you're thinking about building your grow

120
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,839
a lot of people say no my house will

121
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,699
probably be able to do it no it won't do

122
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,619
your house isn't special you don't have

123
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,229
magic breakers you didn't buy a magic

124
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,149
ballasts

125
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,890
you're probably gonna flip breakers if

126
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:32,929
you put too much electricity through

127
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,969
them and you also start running a risk

128
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,310
of fire everything starts getting weaker

129
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,570
the more time you flip that breaker the

130
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,980
weaker its getting which also means

131
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,180
you're heating up the receptacles which

132
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,160
also means you're heating up the wires

133
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,920
you're stressing everything over time

134
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,750
that equals fire so just quit pressing

135
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,240
your luck reduce your amount of lights

136
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,589
settle for having less lighting or pay

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
for the electrical upgrades that are

138
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:55,489
required and here's another idea that

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,050
people get they plug in the timer then

140
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,460
they plug in the power strip and then

141
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,410
they plug in their light and other

142
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,029
accessories into that power strip make

143
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,670
sure if you're gonna do that that that

144
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,889
power strip is strong enough and rated

145
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,840
to support the voltage and amperage for

146
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,209
all of the electronics you're plugging

147
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,589
into there also you can't plug in

148
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,120
another light just by doing that you're

149
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:16,250
gonna blow up that timer it's gonna

150
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,389
short out or you're gonna short out the

151
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,519
receptacles I've already talked about

152
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,829
the things that are gonna happen you can

153
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,539
plug in an extension cord or a power

154
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:25,789
strip into your timer and provide

155
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,760
multiple plug in spots so they all come

156
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,040
on at the same time but do not overload

157
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,050
that power strip maybe have the light

158
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,430
and a fan come on at the same time with

159
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,199
the power strip that's not a bad idea

160
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,000
maybe a light and too small fans would

161
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,949
work for you maybe a light a blower and

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
a fan but don't think you can outsmart

163
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,939
electricity don't think you got smart by

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,860
plugging in a power strip and then you

165
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,660
were able to overload that that timer

166
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,129
that timer will just crap out on you and

167
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,530
then it'll be dark or it'll catch on

168
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,060
fire they may just melt all right so let

169
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,609
me get back on track for one light a

170
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,230
timer plug directly into the wall then

171
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,910
the light plugged in to bat that is

172
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,500
perfect for one light you can also

173
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,630
possibly run two lights if you're

174
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,939
running for 600 watt lights with a dual

175
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,889
timer they do make that it is available

176
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,420
at your gross store it may be available

177
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,949
at your local hardware store I'm not

178
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,350
sure what's available to you it is

179
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,839
certainly available on Amazon of course

180
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,760
we always recommend you shop locally at

181
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,769
a mom and pop shop avoid those big box

182
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,170
stores recently I've said things like

183
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:23,120
Lowe's and Walmart I say that because I

184
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,210
know you guys have those but if you have

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,250
a smaller local shop go there that does

186
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:30,139
help out all right now we know how to

187
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,509
control one or two lights we just use a

188
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,800
basic horticultural timer plug it into

189
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,569
the wall plug your light into there

190
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,939
that's real easy now what if we want to

191
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,159
run three maybe four maybe six or eight

192
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,660
lights what do we do then the first step

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
to that is Electrical up

194
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,110
I'm gonna talk about that a lot when we

195
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,370
talk about these lessons because I don't

196
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,920
want you to put yourself or your house

197
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,329
in danger so electrical upgrades if

198
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,330
you're gonna do four lights in a room

199
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,379
you will need electrical upgrades now

200
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,729
when you're doing the electrical

201
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,519
upgrades is the time to start thinking

202
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,650
about your lighting controllers some of

203
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,539
them have a plug it looks like the plug

204
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,729
that plugs into the dryer some of them

205
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,280
are sold with just bare wires at the end

206
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,930
you have to hardwire in keep that in

207
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,449
mind when you're designing your space

208
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,370
and selecting your controller do you

209
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,259
want to hardwire your controller in is

210
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,060
this going to be a permanent fixture or

211
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,310
do you want something you can plug into

212
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,259
a dryer type plug in and then maybe you

213
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,300
can upgrade or downgrade or replace that

214
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,709
unit in the future think about this now

215
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,210
while you're planning your grow so let's

216
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,789
talk about lighting controllers while

217
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:30,680
we're here what do I mean by a lighting

218
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,319
controller a lighting controller is

219
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,180
basically a large timer that like I said

220
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,279
it either plugs into the dryer plug or

221
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,259
it's hardwired right in and it's got

222
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,519
multiple plugins on it to where you can

223
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,409
plug in 4 6 8 I've seen 12 lights on one

224
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,599
of these devices I've seen 24 lights on

225
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,000
a flip box on lighting controllers a

226
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,370
Gavita master controller will run 48

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,649
lights at one time I believe let's focus

228
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,259
more on something you may find in a home

229
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:00,649
grow now for a lighting controller and a

230
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,689
small home grow you may find a box with

231
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:05,359
the timer in it with a bunch of plugins

232
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,069
in it with a cord that comes out like I

233
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,560
said that plugs into the 240 or it's

234
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,230
hardwired in now that one timer will

235
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,480
function all of the plugins on that box

236
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,700
there may also be a switch it will allow

237
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,470
a couple of those plugins to operate

238
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,420
independently so they can stay on all

239
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,190
the time or you can flip a switch and

240
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,050
they work with the timer some of the

241
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,639
boxes have that some of them don't the

242
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,280
power box is what I'm speaking of

243
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,409
specifically so basically instead of

244
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,969
plugging a bunch of timers in and trying

245
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,129
to sync them up and plugging all your

246
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,960
lights into for individual timers you

247
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,549
put up a light controller you set the

248
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,469
timer on that you set the light schedule

249
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,059
you want on that you either hardwire

250
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,250
that in or you plug it into the dryer

251
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:46,189
fixture then you plug your grow lights

252
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,960
into that controller and then when the

253
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,820
scheduled lighting cycle comes on all

254
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,680
four lights come on at once when it goes

255
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,610
off all four lights go off at once you

256
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,379
don't have to deal with a bunch of

257
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,409
timers you don't have to try to sync up

258
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,179
four different timers

259
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,309
have to try to fit four timers in one

260
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,799
spot and plug lights into them it's all

261
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:04,049
easy to program with one unit with one

262
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,318
timer there are a lot of different

263
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,508
brands of lighting controllers available

264
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:11,849
earlier I recommended a digital timer

265
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:14,370
with the battery backup I would also

266
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,889
recommend something similar with your

267
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,778
controller they do offer a light

268
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,730
controller that has a timer with the

269
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:23,519
battery in it so if the power does go

270
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,339
out that timer stays on the same cycle

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,438
that is always advantageous so whether

272
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,569
it's digital or it's analog on your

273
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:32,610
lighting controller try to look for one

274
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:34,318
with a battery backup so if you do have

275
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,230
a power failure it doesn't throw

276
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:39,149
everything off schedule for a home grow

277
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,860
or maybe a small garage grove or

278
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,110
something like a shed grow I would

279
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,959
probably recommend a power box or a

280
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,699
Titan lighting controller I know I don't

281
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,049
recommend a lot of brands I try to stay

282
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:51,659
away from brands but those are gonna be

283
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:53,729
the two that are most affordable for

284
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,429
somebody trying to get into a medium

285
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,528
sized grow I often talk about a four

286
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:02,458
light room that I work in in that room

287
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:04,588
it is controlled by a power box DPC 7500

288
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,649
it's got the dryer plug that plugs into

289
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,230
a dedicated dryer type plug in that room

290
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,839
then the unit has spots for four plugins

291
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,000
that are synced up with the timer then

292
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,889
there are two plugins that you have the

293
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,750
option of pressing a switch and those

294
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,909
plugins either work with the timer or

295
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,278
they are on continuous which means they

296
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:25,409
never turn off so in those four main

297
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,448
plugins that work with the timer I plug

298
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,578
in four lights and those other two

299
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:31,229
plugins I've got a fan and my main

300
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:34,828
extraction blower running so it's all

301
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,720
operating off of that one unit there are

302
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:38,609
a lot of options when it comes to

303
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,920
lighting controllers so start thinking

304
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,959
about that as we design our grow room

305
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,519
we've got to plug our lights into

306
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,409
something and we've also got to keep our

307
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,629
lights on a schedule so a lighting

308
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:50,759
controller will be a huge decision in

309
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,620
designing your grow now let's talk a

310
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,558
little bit about your air conditioner

311
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,058
how are you going to control your air

312
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:58,799
conditioner are you going to plug it

313
00:10:57,058 --> 00:11:00,808
directly into the wall are you gonna

314
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,278
plug it into one of those accessory

315
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:04,350
switches on the power box that it's

316
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,379
constantly on and then at that point are

317
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,940
you going to use the thermostat on the

318
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,279
air conditioner and rely on

319
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,110
that or are we going to plug the

320
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,629
air-conditioner into another trigger

321
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,129
device that has a sensor that hangs in

322
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,259
the middle of the room and pays

323
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:22,049
attention to the temperature there those

324
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,789
are a few things to think about so when

325
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,979
you are buying your air-conditioner if

326
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:28,829
you plan on plugging it into another

327
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,800
triggering device make sure you buy an

328
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,930
analog air conditioner with analog

329
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,359
controllers like a knob that clicks like

330
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:38,849
a high medium low some of your digital

331
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,909
air conditioners won't work if you try

332
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,379
to trigger them with another device so

333
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,049
here's how it will work you will have a

334
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,480
switch that plugs into the wall that

335
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,429
switch will have a setting that says I

336
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,039
want this device to come on when the

337
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:54,929
temperature gets this high I want this

338
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,639
device to go off when the temperature

339
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,949
gets this low so it's just a little

340
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,809
range that you set then that thing has a

341
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,910
cord that hangs in the center of the

342
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,349
room with a thermometer so now we're

343
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,299
getting the temperature from the center

344
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,730
of the room instead of where that air

345
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,259
conditioner is located now we can

346
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,509
actually take a reading from the plant

347
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,309
area instead of that one wall where the

348
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:15,779
air conditioner is sitting so now the

349
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,250
air conditioner is plugged into this cap

350
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,750
switch the switch is reading from the

351
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,000
middle of the room now what's gonna

352
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,529
happen it's gonna say oh it's reached

353
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,090
the temperature we want let's turn it

354
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,589
off it doesn't reach up and hit the off

355
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,570
switch on the air conditioner it simply

356
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,000
cuts off the power so now there's no

357
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,340
power everything has reset on your

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,559
digital device when it comes back on is

359
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,509
that digital air conditioner gonna come

360
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,039
back on in the previous setting or is it

361
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:39,659
just gonna come back on and blink and

362
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,669
wait for human interaction to tell it

363
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,339
what to do that's the downfall of

364
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:46,709
digital devices if you only plan to

365
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,080
trigger your air conditioner with the

366
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,540
air conditioners onboard controls you

367
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,460
can get a digital air conditioner if you

368
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:56,610
plan to run your air conditioner through

369
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,250
another triggering device I recommend an

370
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,230
analogue air conditioner I will make the

371
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,769
same recommendation when it comes to

372
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,690
humidifiers and dehumidifiers if you

373
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,549
want to plug them into the wall and let

374
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,830
them work off their own functions off

375
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:13,229
their own settings you can do that and

376
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,780
that will be just fine for a tent or a

377
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,839
small room if you really want to dial it

378
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,759
in I recommend something that can take a

379
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,080
humidity measurement from the middle of

380
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,700
the room

381
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,740
I talked about earlier with the air

382
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,870
conditioner you would have a cap switch

383
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,210
that plugs into the wall this would have

384
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,799
a humidistat controller on it it would

385
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,740
say when the humidity gets to this point

386
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,759
activate this power this device it

387
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,870
doesn't even know it's plugged into

388
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,090
there it just knows that it needs to

389
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,970
power that switch when the humidity gets

390
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:44,280
below here turn that switch off that cap

391
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,170
switch then has a humidistat

392
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,509
on a cord that we can hang in the center

393
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,159
of the room that way we can get our

394
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,019
humidity measurement from a more

395
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,000
appropriate place instead of down on the

396
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,730
corner on the floor where the humidifier

397
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,379
or dehumidifier is located so we've got

398
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,600
a cap switch it's plugged into the wall

399
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:03,450
it's got settings on it it's got a

400
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,909
courted humidity reader on it that hangs

401
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,340
in the center of the room then we plug

402
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,439
our humidifier or dehumidifier into that

403
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,840
cap switch and it is activated by

404
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,000
readings from the center of the room

405
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,190
these extra controllers are not

406
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,159
necessary but if you really want to dial

407
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,320
in your room to a precise humidity range

408
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,750
and the temperature range and get that

409
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,000
vapor pressure deficit dialed in for

410
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,399
your plants these types of devices are

411
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,559
what you're going to need they make cap

412
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,840
switches to trigger everything you can

413
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,879
trigger your fans your blowers you can

414
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,700
set up cap switches to trigger any type

415
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,100
of grow room equipment if your equipment

416
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,920
is compatible you need the type of

417
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,110
air-conditioner dehumidifier and/or

418
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,149
humidifier that has a knob where you can

419
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,129
set to high and then you can plug those

420
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,139
into other devices that will control

421
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:54,179
them that way when it they're necessary

422
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,409
they just come on if their highest and

423
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,379
they activate it and then when you reach

424
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:00,629
the parameters you need they turn off

425
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:02,909
for that to work we need devices that

426
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:05,159
can handle power interruptions it won't

427
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:07,949
reset their settings when they come back

428
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:11,370
on now that's the basic equipment to set

429
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:13,020
up an analog grow room now let's talk

430
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,149
about automating things a little more

431
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,519
and also giving ourselves the ability to

432
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,149
make adjustments from a remote location

433
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,039
and also turn off and on equipment from

434
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,620
remote locations we'll be able to

435
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,959
monitor our grow and make changes on the

436
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,090
fly with some of the advanced technology

437
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,830
that is available for our grow rooms

438
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,500
let's talk a little bit about that stuff

439
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,550
there are several options for setting up

440
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,159
a more odd

441
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:41,250
made a grow room through technology I'm

442
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,708
trying to avoid pitching specific brands

443
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,070
and specific products here but for this

444
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:48,778
example I'm going to use a specific

445
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,420
piece of equipment and a specific brand

446
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:53,578
of equipment to paint a picture of how

447
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,259
we can set up an automated grow room I

448
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,179
have a lot of experience with this

449
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,490
device and with this equipment so it

450
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:01,769
makes it easy for me to draw the plan in

451
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,379
my head which makes it easier for me to

452
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:06,089
kind of convey the idea to you this is

453
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,338
an example of how I set up the

454
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,200
automation at a recent facility I worked

455
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,170
with and I'm gonna try to stay away from

456
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,200
mentioning brand names and proprietary

457
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:18,569
specific names of their devices but this

458
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,370
is how we do it this brand comes with

459
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,700
their product comes with a brain that

460
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:26,190
brain syncs up through Wi-Fi to your

461
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,890
cell phone you set up an account you

462
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,230
create a password then you design your

463
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:33,059
grow rooms if you've got a bedroom just

464
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,220
go make veg room if you've got two

465
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,159
bedrooms make two bedrooms give them a

466
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,589
name then you enter your flower rooms

467
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,969
flower a flower B flower C however you

468
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:45,899
want to do it you just type them in and

469
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,730
you create the rooms then you select a

470
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,649
room on the application if you're doing

471
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,269
a small home grow it's probably just the

472
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,250
flower room the one room that you've got

473
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,199
now that's where the next fun piece of

474
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,539
equipment comes in the next piece of

475
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,310
equipment looks like a basic power strip

476
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:02,519
it's got a plug that plugs into the wall

477
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:05,279
and then it has four available plug in

478
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,400
spots it plugs into the wall and now it

479
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,889
connects wirelessly to that brain unit

480
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,319
that is connected to your phone now that

481
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:17,819
power strip has four slots in it that

482
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:19,918
are numbered 1 2 3 &amp; 4 now you open up

483
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,149
the application on your phone and it

484
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,189
will show you that you have plugged in

485
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,290
that power strip it knows it's there the

486
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,699
app is found it the brain says hey this

487
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,308
is here what do you want me to do with

488
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,169
it you add it you say that is in room 1

489
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,910
you assign it to a room number now

490
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,919
you're already got a room started with a

491
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,290
piece of equipment in there now it's got

492
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,600
4 slots on it you can assign each of

493
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:42,359
those 4 slots to be a different piece of

494
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,759
equipment so I would say slot 1 is my

495
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,109
lights and now you just it's really easy

496
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,240
to scroll through there's a little dial

497
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,459
it says what is plugged into slot 1 is

498
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,500
an HVAC

499
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,600
in a light is it irrigation it's real

500
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,339
easy it's a light cool no problem

501
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,959
you just hold it slot number one is a

502
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,819
light slot number two is an air

503
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,130
conditioner slot number three is a

504
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:02,689
blower and slot number 4 is a

505
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,970
dehumidifier we're just being

506
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,429
hypothetical here so once you've got all

507
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,740
of the devices assigned to that power

508
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:12,320
strip you go to the room and set

509
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,329
settings for the room so our light is

510
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,798
plugged into spot number one you just go

511
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:18,769
to lighting and you set a lighting

512
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:21,589
schedule and you hit save and now slot 1

513
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:23,450
will act accordingly to the schedule you

514
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:26,148
have just set so the air conditioner at

515
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,798
slot 2 you just go to HVAC then you tell

516
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:30,019
it I want it to stay this temperature in

517
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,480
here so if it gets too hot it'll fire up

518
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,908
slot number 2 on that power strip and

519
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,640
each spot on that power strip will act

520
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,649
as program now you're gonna say how does

521
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,020
it know what to do because there's

522
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:44,000
another device in the box that hangs in

523
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:47,000
the very center of the room and this

524
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,980
device has a light temperature and

525
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,028
humidity sensor that takes a reading

526
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,919
every 15 seconds so every 15 seconds it

527
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:57,140
takes a fresh reading and it sends the

528
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,340
information back to the brain unit and

529
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,778
the brain says ok so it's 9 a.m. which

530
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,389
means the lights need to be on so I'll

531
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:06,769
keep that switch on it's gotten up to 84

532
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,778
degrees in here so I need to turn on the

533
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,429
air conditioner and let's check on the

534
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:12,079
humidity humidity is cool so we don't

535
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,610
need to turn on that device and the fan

536
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,798
that goes with the air conditioner so

537
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,569
that came on to probably so now your

538
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,879
lights are on the air conditioners on

539
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:21,288
the fans blown around that dehumidifier

540
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,750
doesn't need to be on so it's just

541
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:25,548
chilling and every 15 seconds that units

542
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,169
gonna keep taking measurements and then

543
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:29,480
once it sees that we've gotten down to

544
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,100
the parameters we've programmed in then

545
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,110
it will turn off that air conditioner

546
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:35,148
that fan will turn off the lights will

547
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:36,918
stay on and that dehumidifier will be

548
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:39,589
right there on standby for when we need

549
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,509
it the unit I'm talking about also has

550
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,668
the ability to measure the moisture

551
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:45,589
content in your medium if you're running

552
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:47,870
rock wool cubes if you're running cocoa

553
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:50,209
if you're running soil whatever type of

554
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:52,639
medium you're working in this device has

555
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,970
the ability to measure the moisture

556
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,370
content in your medium that means you

557
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,880
can set up automated irrigation when the

558
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:03,408
plants reach a certain dryness how does

559
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,700
that work it's fairly

560
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,769
you put these little sticks in your

561
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,140
medium and you calibrate them they link

562
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,630
up to the water content sensor

563
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,059
controller which wirelessly hooks up to

564
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,429
the brain which wirelessly relays to

565
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:18,980
your phone so that moisture content

566
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:21,320
meter is constantly every 15 seconds

567
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,360
taking a moisture meter in your medium

568
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,980
it's sending that reading up to the

569
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,599
little brain which is sending it back to

570
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,610
the main brain which is sending it to

571
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,769
your phone now if you have the equipment

572
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:32,629
installed you can go to that room you

573
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:35,509
can open the irrigation tab on your

574
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,700
phone and you can tell it to water that

575
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,440
room when it gets to a certain dryness

576
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,480
and you can tell it to water for a

577
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,548
certain amount of time or until it

578
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,349
reaches a certain moisture level

579
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:47,480
basically the way you would do that you

580
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,579
would plug your irrigation pump into

581
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,169
that power strip I spoke of earlier or

582
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,089
you can add another one of their

583
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,340
specified power strips that syncs up

584
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:57,230
wirelessly to the brain which then syncs

585
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,269
wirelessly to your phone so you plug

586
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,509
your irrigation pump into that you go to

587
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:04,759
the irrigation tab in the application

588
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,558
and you tell it when to water and then

589
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,808
when the plants get dry it simply sends

590
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,038
electricity to plug number four or

591
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,408
whichever plug you assigned as

592
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:14,210
irrigation it'll activate that it will

593
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,070
start watering once it gets wet enough

594
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,980
it will know because it's got a moisture

595
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:20,750
content sensor in your medium and it

596
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,190
will say wet enough and it'll send a

597
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,470
signal to the brain and it will

598
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,048
discontinue powering your irrigation

599
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,298
pump now there are a lot of ways to

600
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:31,038
irrigate your system maybe you're

601
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:32,480
running a flood and drain system maybe

602
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,519
that will just tell it when to flood and

603
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,259
drain maybe you're running pots with an

604
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,298
automated drip system like we talked

605
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,548
about in another episode however you do

606
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:43,069
it basically you were just triggering

607
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:45,408
the pump to come on and it knows when to

608
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:48,408
come on because we've got those moisture

609
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,809
content sensors pressed into our medium

610
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:52,669
at specified intervals and the unit I'm

611
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:55,099
talking about allows you to have six

612
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,350
different water probes in different

613
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:59,808
locations hooked up to one unit so there

614
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,240
are six wired probes that go back to one

615
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:04,250
unit that one unit then wirelessly sends

616
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,319
the data back to the brain that brain

617
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,509
relays it to your phone so once we've

618
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,269
dialed in automated lighting automated

619
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:12,888
air conditioning automated

620
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,079
dehumidification and humidification and

621
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:16,759
now we've got automated irrigation we

622
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:20,029
have almost got a fully

623
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:23,000
automated grow room with very basic

624
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,940
equipment and honestly not a huge budget

625
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,619
if you shop smart I know it's exciting

626
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,390
to get everything automated you want it

627
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:31,219
all dialed in you want it just to happen

628
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,660
it's fun watching the Machine happen I

629
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,279
would just stand in the corner of the

630
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,080
grow room and look at a timer and go so

631
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,428
in about 10 seconds and you would know

632
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,079
that that's gonna switch off that

633
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,880
thing's gonna go that's gonna happen all

634
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,019
the bells are gonna happen the whistles

635
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,750
are gonna happen it's like a big game a

636
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,609
mousetrap it feels really great to watch

637
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,759
with all that being said some of my

638
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:52,219
favorite advice is keep it simple stupid

639
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,048
I know I'm calling you stupid but that's

640
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,880
the way the saying goes keep it simple

641
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:57,710
stoner how's that does that feel better

642
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,410
keep it simple stoner we don't need to

643
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,929
make everything elaborate a small grow

644
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:05,808
does not need a lot of equipment the

645
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:08,720
more electronics you have the more knobs

646
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:11,329
and dials and bells and whistles you've

647
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,370
got the more [ __ ] can go wrong if you've

648
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:15,259
got a light and a fan and an air

649
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,418
conditioner and some way to pull stale

650
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:20,150
air and heat out of that room you have

651
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:21,590
got all you need of course it is fun to

652
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,450
trick out the room it's fun to have

653
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:25,668
accessories it's fun to have toys and

654
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,940
it's also going to improve your quality

655
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,799
if you dial it in properly don't spend

656
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,960
money on a bunch of toys just to have

657
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,940
them think about what you need think

658
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,370
about what's necessity and think about

659
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,100
the order in which you need your new

660
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:41,928
toys I'm gonna kind of skip off of my

661
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,730
notes here and I'm gonna say instead of

662
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,280
spending a whole bunch of money on some

663
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,679
automation why not buy yourself a better

664
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,859
pH pan I was gonna talk later about pH

665
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,080
pins and EC meters but now's a good time

666
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:56,569
instead of spending a lot of money on

667
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,039
automation you need a quality pH pen

668
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,439
your plans are gonna look like [ __ ]

669
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,909
without proper pH so if you're putting

670
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,470
together a budget and you're trying to

671
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,290
include Auto watering and you're trying

672
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,150
to decide between a quality pH pin or

673
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,149
maybe some fancy auto watering stuff I

674
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,370
highly recommend you go with a good pH

675
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,919
pen you need that from the beginning

676
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:18,139
you can add auto watering later you can

677
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,360
buy fancier toys later if you're on a

678
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,549
tight budget get the necessities first

679
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,019
and then we can expand in the future if

680
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,668
you don't have the right stuff you're

681
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,408
not gonna have a quality product and

682
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:27,770
it's all going to be a giant waste of

683
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,630
money

684
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,769
all right we've talked about controlling

685
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,300
everything

686
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,039
here's something that I want to include

687
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:36,049
but I'm not sure where it fits in so I'm

688
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,629
just gonna tag it in right here

689
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:41,450
what about co2 augmentation maybe you

690
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,550
want to add co2 to your grow room this

691
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,220
is probably going to require you making

692
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:48,710
extra trips to either the gross store or

693
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,569
the commercial gas place our local place

694
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,970
here is called air gas you're gonna have

695
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:55,039
to buy or rent a container you're gonna

696
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,900
have to get that refilled as frequently

697
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,059
as you need it I don't know how often

698
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,500
it's going to need to be refilled in

699
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,629
your environment I don't know how well

700
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,460
sealed your room is I don't know how

701
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,170
much co2 your room starts with I don't

702
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,150
know how much co2 you're trying to get

703
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,310
it to I don't know how often you'll need

704
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,740
your containers filled but for co2

705
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,950
augmentation you're going to need either

706
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,900
those big tanks or a co2 burner which

707
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,870
will have to be hardwired into your

708
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,580
natural gas line so tanks are probably

709
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,919
the easiest way to go you'll have to get

710
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:27,230
the tanks get them to the room if you're

711
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,000
not an able-bodied person this could be

712
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,549
challenging the larger tanks are hard

713
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,559
for me to move the smaller tanks are not

714
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,659
light either so once you've got the

715
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,149
tanks to the room now you require a

716
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,710
regulator this screws on to the nozzle

717
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,420
on the tank it'll be obvious when you've

718
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,490
got the tank in the regulator you will

719
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,289
see where that goes you screw on the

720
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,779
regulator there are a couple of knobs

721
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,879
you've got to turn you've got to open

722
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,410
the tank turn the gas on to the tank now

723
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,780
it's gonna be flowing to the regulator

724
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,600
that regulator has a valve you can turn

725
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:58,490
it will allow gas to flow through the

726
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,579
lines there are lines that attach to the

727
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,890
regulator hang those lines high in your

728
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:06,470
grow I like to hang them right about the

729
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,380
height of the lights co2 is a gas that

730
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,029
is heavier than oxygen that co2 is gonna

731
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,100
pump through those lines and it will

732
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:16,039
fall right down onto the plants and

733
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:17,869
become available for the plants now how

734
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:20,059
do we know how much co2 is in the room

735
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:23,419
that's when co2 gets expensive you need

736
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:26,299
a co2 monitor you can get a standalone

737
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,340
co2 monitor or this will work right into

738
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,669
the automated system I was talking about

739
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:34,369
earlier there is a tab for co2 so we

740
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,350
need a co2 monitor whether a standalone

741
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,389
unit or unit that's combined with our

742
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:40,730
other monitoring and triggering system

743
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:44,390
now your more expensive co2 monitors

744
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,110
will also have a co2 controller the co2

745
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,210
control

746
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:49,579
work very similarly to the cap

747
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,200
controllers I talked about earlier there

748
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:52,939
are a lot of different brands and styles

749
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,670
available most of them will have a

750
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,950
screen on that screen you can set the

751
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,259
level that you want the co2 to reach in

752
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,210
that room some of the more advanced

753
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,879
models will also give you the option to

754
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,470
set a schedule so that it comes on only

755
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,090
when the lights are on and it does not

756
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,799
come on when the lights are off we don't

757
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:12,169
need to add co2 when the lights are off

758
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:14,210
so you'll be able to set the level you

759
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,090
want the co2 to reach and you'll be able

760
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,130
to set a schedule now this co2 monitor

761
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:21,379
has a cord hanging off of it which plugs

762
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:24,320
into the wall or your power source now

763
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,600
the plug that plugs into the wall has a

764
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,960
piggyback that you can just plug your

765
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,909
co2 regulator directly into so now that

766
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,799
thing's going to monitor the level of

767
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,080
co2 in the room and when it needs

768
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,599
electricity triggered to the co2

769
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,909
regulator it will just fire up and let

770
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,889
that co2 regulator know to come on the

771
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,450
co2 regulator will pump gas down those

772
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,610
lines that you've got hung above the

773
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,440
canopy and then once that co2 regulator

774
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:50,389
says oh it's enough it'll turn that

775
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,090
right off for you so that is the best

776
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:55,790
way in my opinion to set up co2 in a

777
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,589
small grow that's very similar to the

778
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,659
way it's done in a large commercial grow

779
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:01,549
we do the same lines above the canopy of

780
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,810
course the lines are much longer and of

781
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,029
course we're not running to the growth

782
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,980
store to refill our canisters all the

783
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,440
time we have a truck that comes and they

784
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,450
actually link up to a giant set of

785
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,120
canisters outside there are about a

786
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,950
dozen six foot tall canisters outside

787
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,500
that the truck fills for us that lasts

788
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,000
about half a week maybe a little less

789
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,940
depending on how many of the rooms are

790
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,289
in full flower but it's very similar to

791
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,840
the way it's done in a commercial

792
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:28,909
facility now if you don't want to use

793
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,939
the co2 monitor I understand they're

794
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,430
expensive you can put the regulator on a

795
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,340
timer but when you do that how do you

796
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,860
know how much co2 is in that room how do

797
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,659
you know if you even need to add co2 how

798
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:43,519
do you know if you haven't overdone it

799
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,400
and you're not wasting co2 at this point

800
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,900
I think a co2 monitor is really worth

801
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,420
the money you're gonna spend because

802
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,730
then you can save on co2 in the long run

803
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,950
you won't be overdoing it you won't be

804
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,779
wasting co2 you won't just be blasting

805
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,000
co2 into the room and wondering what's

806
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,649
in there I like knowing what's happening

807
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,079
my grow rooms if they're big if they're

808
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,640
small it's always better to take good

809
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:06,529
notes and understand what is happening

810
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,090
in there instead of just blasting

811
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:10,339
something that you're paying a lot of

812
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:12,470
money for and not understanding any type

813
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:15,169
of results so if I'm paying money for

814
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,210
co2 I would like to have a co2 monitor

815
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,310
just to see some sort of number go up

816
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,019
just to see my money turn into something

817
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,329
even if it's just a number on that

818
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:25,940
monitor I want to see some kind of

819
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:29,059
result so that is my quick sidebar on

820
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,250
co2 augmentation and co2 equipment I

821
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,829
feel like that fit perfectly right there

822
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,380
I feel like this series of grow lessons

823
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:38,179
is off to a great start we've got some

824
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,550
goals in mind for the grow we know what

825
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,930
to expect from the grow we know where to

826
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:43,759
put the grow we have a good

827
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,100
understanding of what equipment we need

828
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,720
for the grow we've learned how to set up

829
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:49,759
our lighting we've learned how to set up

830
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,220
our air conditioning we understand what

831
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,629
type of humidifier and dehumidifier we

832
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,910
might need we've got a good

833
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,310
understanding of how to set up our co2 I

834
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,040
think we are off to a really good start

835
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,529
in the next episode I plan to talk about

836
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,079
selecting the appropriate pots soil and

837
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:08,779
nutrients for your grow and after that

838
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,029
we'll work our way into integrated pest

839
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,410
management before I start wrapping up
