everybody who gave me feedback

125
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,719
on the last episode i did use a

126
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
different camera setting on the last

127
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,719
episode i felt like that video came out

128
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,158
beautifully i do like the camera

129
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,759
settings i like those adjustments i've

130
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,598
got the lights right where i need them

131
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,439
i think we've got the podcast kind of

132
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,798
dialed in now it's time to decorate

133
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,479
around here and do a little bit of stuff

134
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
like that but thank you for all of the

135
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,238
feedback all of the support

136
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,639
i really like the way that video came

137
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
out this video will be edited on the

138
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,518
brand new

139
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
mac mini the mac mini finally made it

140
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,039
here so this video will be the first one

141
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
that i edit on that mac mini

142
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,798
i'm going to throw this video into

143
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
imovie my old editing software and see

144
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,840
how much faster

145
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
the editing process is in imovie just

146
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
because i want to compare the two

147
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
computers

148
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
once i see how much more quickly i can

149
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,759
process an imovie

150
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,639
then i get to learn final cut pro so

151
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,399
expect some

152
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,719
video edits and improvements in the

153
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,279
video here in the near future

154
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
also also excuse me for that also bear

155
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,559
with me and be patient with me while i

156
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,479
learn final cut pro

157
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
i've opened up that application one time

158
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,839
and there's a lot going on so i've got a

159
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
lot to learn

160
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,039
have no fear i'm good at learning

161
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,319
programs you guys have watched me evolve

162
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
and watch me learn

163

164
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,599
of

165
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,959
six or eight months so there's been a

166
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,879
lot of changes and there will continue

167
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,000
to be more changes and improvements i am

168
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439

00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,639
compassionate

337
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,559
with each other with ourselves with

338
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,639
those that are around us especially the

339
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,159
people that are doing a service for us

340
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,159
we've gotten used to just expecting the

341
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,079
mail to come we take that for granted

342
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,838
the mail person the mail carrier has a

343
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,759
family also they want to go home and

344
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,360
smoke a bowl just as bad as you do

345
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,799
they got [ __ ] to do they're overwhelmed

346
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
let's not be a dick to them

347
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,799
uh let's try to tip them and give them a

348
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,039
bonus where we can if we're able to

349
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
in these weird times to make life easier

350
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,519
for everybody right now we don't need to

351
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
make [ __ ] harder

352
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
life is hard enough right now speaking

353
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,759
of making life easier if you do

354
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
celebrate christmas don't forget to

355
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,639
leave out some milk and cookies and a

356
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,720

357
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,919

359
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,199
i've got so much stuff written down and

360
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,919
i'm way off track on my notes here

361
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,278
disc discord on the last episode i

362
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,159
talked about some friends of ours that

363
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,759
created an irie genetics discord page

364
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,240
a lot of people then said how do i get

365
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,039
to that honestly i am brand new to

366
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
discord

367
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,078
and i haven't spent a lot of time on

368
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
there because i'm overwhelmed myself

369
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,000

372
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,480

i know that things are rough out there

480
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
money isn't as abundant as it used to be

481

483
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,838
working hard for their money

484
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,200
you got to go somewhere you don't want

485
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,800
to be and deal with people you don't

486
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,360
want to deal with and get told what to

487
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,799
do

488
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
by somebody you probably don't want to

489
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,838
hear some [ __ ] from you probably

490
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,439
just want to go home and play the new

491
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,560
xbox or play the new playstation and

492
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,079
take a couple of dabs

493
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,278

494
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,078
with your puppy or whatever you're going

495
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,838
to do

496
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,519
i get it you're stuck at work to make

497
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,240
the money and then you spend some of

498
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
that money

499
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839

520
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,439
two computers patreon has bought two

521
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
computers that sounds crazy right

522
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,360
i said on a long a long time ago like

523
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,120
two years ago i said hey this computer's

524
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,919
taking a [ __ ] and it's hard to produce a

525
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,078
podcast

526
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,838
and i'm getting frustrated patreon

527
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,919
contributions started pouring in

528
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,240
i was able to pay for this macbook right

529
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,679
here with patreon contributions i walked

530
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,039
in i said this is my budget

531
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,559
and they said this is the computer you

532
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,958
want for that budget and i said let's do

533
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,879
it

534
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,119
this computer has lasted two years and

535
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,519
it is amazing it works very well

536
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
i upgraded to the 4k camera when i

537
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,198
started dumping those 4k videos into

538
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
this computer this computer started

539
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,838
smoking and making

540
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,159
weird noises it was like hey i'm a good

541
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
computer but you're asking a lot of me

542
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,198
so i did some research i talked to a few

543
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,198
of our tech nerds

544
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,879
shout out to reefer matinus uh shout out

545
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,399
to tony shout out to a lot of people

546
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,958
that helped me out but they guided me

547
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,600
toward

548
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,039
the mac mini with the m1 chip so

549
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,680
yesterday in the mail

550
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,719
i received a mac mini with an m1 chip it

551
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,239
is set up now

552
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
i think it's probably downloading

553
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,759
updates as we speak but by the time we

554
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,600
get done here i'll get to go play with

555
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,039
that i'm going to edit this video

556
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,879
in that machine like i talked about

557
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,039
before so that was

558
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,278
from you guys you guys covered the cost

559
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,480
of that new mac so thank you without you

560
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,919

561
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,278
have to dug into my pocket and pulled

562
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,319
that out and right now that might not be

563
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,240
in the budget

564
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,079
because it's christmas time and i got to

605
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,399

609
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,880
you feel as a person when you're nicer

610
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,480
to other people this weird little thing

611
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,120
in the world comes back and makes the

612
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,400
world

613
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,078
nicer to you well i did a podcast for

614
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,839
free i gave out a bunch of information i

615
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,000
was super nice to a bunch of people look

616
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,359
i got a dope ass hat i got a cool

617
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,640
painting and i got some brand new

618
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,639
drumsticks out of the deal

619
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
just for being nice to people karma goes

620
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
in circles you guys

621
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,838
so i know sometimes you just want to

622
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,279
cuss somebody out sometimes you want to

623
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,480
[ __ ] kick something sometimes you

624
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,359
just want to throw some dishes at

625
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
somebody

626
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,558
what's that going to do it's going to

627
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,079
create that negative loop let's be a

628
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,720
good person let's try to shake all that

629
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,558
[ __ ] off

630
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
let's go into 2020 with the most

631
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,440
positive outlook positive attitude we

632
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
can have

633
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,558
because when you laugh at the dumb [ __ ]

634
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,000
the dumb [ __ ] laughs back and goes

635
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,119
you're right i can't get to you

636
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,558
you're right and then you create a

637
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,079
little force field a little bubble of

638
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,000
goodness around yourself

639
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,359
and that little bubble of goodness it

640
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
only lets in goodness and it's

641
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,240
contagious also

642
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,000
if you rub up against some [ __ ] with

643
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,599
your goodness you got the opportunity

644
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,279
to shine that [ __ ] with your

645
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,079
goodness and the [ __ ] can't get near

646
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,000
you

647
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,119
mike used to call it my jaw bubble mike

648
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,200
noticed that i've got a little

649
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,359
protective karmic bubble around me

650
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,360
because i do my best to be a good person

651
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,959
i'm not [ __ ] perfect you guys

652
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,798
i told somebody to [ __ ] themselves in a

653
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,120
text message the other day because

654
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,798
they deserved it so i'm not perfect i'll

655
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,279
say what needs to be said but i do try

656
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,160
to be

657
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,599
the best person i can be at all times

658
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,558
now with that being said

659
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,480
uh 2021 is a fresh year coming up now is

660
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,599
the time to set some goals

661
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,519
by the time you're listening to this

662
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,439
you've got a week until there's a brand

663
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,119
new calendar year we're gonna turn

665
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,319
the back of the calendar we're going to

666
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,759
look 2021 right in the face

667
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,759

668
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,480

669

what are you going to do in 21 2021 what

670
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,558
didn't you accomplish in 2020 what did

671
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,279
you [ __ ] up in 2020 what did you suck at

672
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,599
this year

673
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,759
let's do that better next year let's set

674
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,759
some goals have some accomplishments

675
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,440
also while you're setting those goals

676
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,919
and looking for accomplishments

677
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,440
and ways to realize that you are making

678
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
progress in your life set some goals and

679
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,759
then you know you're moving forward if

680
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
you don't have a goal

681
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,038
you may just stand still and not even

682
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,959
know it if you're gonna if you're

683
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,319
doing something at level five let's get

684
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
to six or seven next year if you're

685
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,159
doing it a seven let's be level 10

686
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,519
by the end of 2021 let's improve

687
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
ourselves this year

688
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,879
also with that being said we've got to

689
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,400
adjust

690
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,679
and adapt to this new way of life 2021

691
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,600
is not going to be like 2019 it's not

692
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
going to be like 2020.

693
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,279
a lot of people keep saying i want the

694
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,480
world to get back to normal

695
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:35,038
and i hate to be that guy but this is

696
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,279
the new normal if you're waiting for

697
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,279
things to go back like they were

698
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,879
you're [ __ ] stuck and it's never

699
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,720
going to be that way i hate to tell you

700
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
that i hate to be that guy

701
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,120
but this is the new world and we've got

702
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,079
to adjust and adapt to what the world

703
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,479
is now all of your old plans it is okay

704
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,000
now

705
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,319
to go back and look at your goals and

706
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,359
plans and scratch that [ __ ] out and say

707
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,119
well covet and replan everything it may

708
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,439
be necessary to do that

709
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,119
so don't think that things are going to

710
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
go back to the way they were

711
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,479
we may get a vaccine some people will

712
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
take it some won't some are going to

713
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
have

714
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,640
[ __ ] conspiracy theories about it i'm

715
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,558
not even going to tell you where i stand

716
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,280
on that because i don't want the emails

717
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,879
but it's not going to be like it was we

718
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,558
will get the vaccine some people will

719
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,600
get treated but there's always going to

720
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,399
be a weirdness

721
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,918
that stemmed from this situation the

722
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
world will not be what it was

723
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,600
that's my opinion i'm getting older i

724
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,798
feel like i've got some foresight

725
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,719
i've been watching i've been paying

726
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,839
attention and i don't think things are

727
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,839
ever going to be

728
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,199
like they were before so when you are

729
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,918
writing your goals when you're setting

730
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,319
your plans and your expectations for

731
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,600
2021

732
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,839
remember that 2019 [ __ ] is not the same

733
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,359
2021 is gonna be way different because

734
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,079
2020 was

735
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,798
[ __ ] weird so set yourself up for

736
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,519
success

737
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,319

755
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
be prepared

756
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,678
let's get our [ __ ] together and help

757
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,439
everybody i feel like i'm rambling

758
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,200
but we've got to have a plan do you have

759
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
some financial goals do you have goals

760
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,038
for what you're going to do do you have

761
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,960
garden goals how many crops are you

762
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,158
going to turn in your grow room

763
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
in 2021 if it takes you 60 days to run a

764
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
crop in there that's two months you

765
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
should get six crops out of that right

766
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,158
it's going to take you a little longer

767
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,759
than 60 days because most of our plants

768
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,080
go 63 65

769
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,519
should get 5.7 crops out of that room

770
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,000
right how are you going to make that

771
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,079
happen

772
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,759
how are you going to veg and flower and

773
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,759
then have more plants in veg to fill

774
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,879
that flower as soon as it comes down

775
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
let's make some grow room goals and

776
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,200
schedules

777
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,038
before the year starts we've got a week

778
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,798
to work on this it's going to kick in in

779
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,960
seven days from the time you hear this

780
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,639
so let's start getting prepared now not

781
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,038
only garden goals what are you going to

782
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,559
learn

783
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,158
are you what are you going to what did

784
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:10,960
you suck at this year were you not a

785
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,640
good cloner

786
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,159
were you not good at identifying males

787
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,159
are you not good at scrogging

788
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,760
are you not good at putting up a trellis

789
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,600
let's get better at those things

790
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:24,158
in 2021 so set yourself up for success

791
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,918
improve in 2021 and have some sort of a

792
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,360
plan and some sort of a goal without

793
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,038
plans and goals i've said this

794
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,399
we don't move forward and if we do move

795
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,000
forward how do we even know

796
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,759
there's nothing to base it on nothing to

797
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,359
judge it on nothing to guide it on

798
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,960
set yourself up for success and have

799
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,959
some sort of a goal

800
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,558
all right you guys i think i've covered

801
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,679
all of the important notes i do have

802
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,960
some sad news

803
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,120
that i saved here for the end of the

804
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,640
podcast um

805
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,639
i've been following a person for a

806
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
really long time on social media

807
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,320
before social media was a thing this

808
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
person was a huge member of the forums

809
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,079
this person as a bin has been a big and

810
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,240
an important member of the cannabis

811
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,399
community and has often been overlooked

812
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
but i want to give a huge uh moment of

813
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
silence and a moment of respect

814
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,839
to a man known as bog the bushy old

815
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,879
grower

816
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,639
unfortunately uh damn i'm gonna cry

817
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,440
bushy old grower passed away recently

818
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
you guys

819
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,120
and bushy old grower was a very

820
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
inspiring grower he's known as bog seeds

821
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,719
bog genetics

822
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,079
if you've smoked boggle gum that is from

823
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
bog a lot of the things

824
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,759
that bog made were bred into the current

825
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,759
strains now

826
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,519

[ __ ] that's important uh you would

889
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,278
always see bog at the event he had

890
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,599
he had a booth at every cannabis cup he

891
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,038
was there the old guy with the ponytail

892
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,240
and sometimes he had a beard sometimes

893
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,400
he didn't he had his wife with him it

894
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,480
was just bog and mrs bogg at the booth

895
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
that's the guy we lost so that was a big

896
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
part of the community

897
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,000
a big part he wasn't as uh outspoken and

898
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,440
popular on social media because he was

899
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,359
an older dude that he was

900
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
before social media that wasn't like his

901
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,399
thing but when he did go on there he

902
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
always had a smile always had a good

903
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,120
attitude

904
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,960
i was always a good dude and always

905
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,558
encouraged us to breed with his gear

906
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,079
and would tell you which plants to breed

907
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,399
