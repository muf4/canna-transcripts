where do i start how about this one

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,878
because it is on the top of the list

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,319
this email came from my friend john this

83
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,039
one came to us on the grow help tab at

84
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,280
iriegenetics.com that's right if you go

85
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,239
to the website

86
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,239
iriegenetics.com there is a grow help

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,759
tab on there when you click on that grow

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,158
help tab it does give you the

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,919
opportunity to answer a few preliminary

90
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,840
questions i ask what are you growing are

91
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,439
you growing indoors or outdoors what's

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
your temperature what's your humidity

93
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,120
what are you feeding this plant i ask

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
several questions that gives me an idea

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
of how to answer your questions people

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
will send me a question they'll say hey

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
my plants yellow what do i do and i've

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
got 20 questions we've kind of cut to

99
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,598
the chase and asked some of those so

100
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,199
that i've got some info a little bit of

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,199
a triage a little bit of a checkup if

102
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,958
you will so before we get to the main

103
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,719
question i ask a few questions our

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,920
friend john here asked a very simple

105
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,680
question so we don't need to know about

106
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,280
his plants as grow room this one came

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,719
from my friend john

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
this is on the grow help tab of course

109
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,359
and it goes a lot like this it says hey

110
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,719
quick question for you what strains were

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
bred with the e phenotype of arise that

112
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,959
is a very good question there's a lot to

113
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,359
talk about here uh first of all what

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,680
does john mean when he says the e

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,239
phenotype of a rise let's talk about

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
that i am known well maybe i'm not i

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,798
like to think that my strain my brand is

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,120
known for a strain known as a rise i

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,519
made a rise f once i took a

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
golden goat female and a daybreaker male

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
and i made some seeds and i named those

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,040
arise now out of that batch of arise

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,800
seeds i ran a lot of them i ran

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
thousands of those myself and i found

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
several keepers

126
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
i found the king solomon male king

127
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,839
solomon my stud male the male that makes

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
my line really potent and popular is

129
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,959
known as king solomon he is a selected

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,040
phenotype from the arise line so there's

131
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,359
a male that got called king solomon

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
there's another male that is known as

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
the golden goat dominant male it doesn't

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,120
have a real name i just call it the

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
golden goat male because it's not for

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,079
sale nobody else touches it nobody's

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,600
ever seen it but me

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,879
that's the golden goat male it's over

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
there that is the one that is used to

140
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,360
make the golden goat back cross

141
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,679
so those are the two males that i kept

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,080
out of that also there were several

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,478
stellar females that stood out in the

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,639
arise line when i would grow them we see

145
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,879
what is known as phenotypical expression

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,600
not all two seeds will grow the same

147
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,600
especially in an f1 or a polyhybrid so

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
when you cross a plant uh when you cross

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
two plants you got a male and a female

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,599
right the offspring are going to show

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
some mommy traits some daddy traits some

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
of them may show grandparent traits and

153
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,399
then some may be right in the middle you

154
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,478
never know what ratios you're going to

155
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,879
get until you do the breeding so that is

156
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,800
where phenotypical expression comes in

157
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,120
some of these plants were taller some of

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,840
them were skinnier some more more squats

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,918
some were real branchy um some of them

160
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,519
were super potent some of them were not

161
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
as potent

162
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,918
these are the different phenotypes i was

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
finding as i was growing these plants

164
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,599
different expressions of the genes maybe

165
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,359
that's different genotypes and phenotype

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,479
is the expression of the room so it's

167
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
finding the different phenoes and

168
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,639
genotypes now i was labeling these

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
plants really basically

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,600
i knew they were called a rise because i

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,520
named it it was mine so as i grew seeds

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
hypothetically maybe i had a five maybe

173
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,799
i had a hundred pack of seeds as i would

174
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
grow them as i would plant them i would

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
just number them a rise number one a

176
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
rise number two a rise number three up

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
to the number that i was using so i did

178
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,478
letters the next time it was probably a

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
through like g or somewhere that's like

180
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,758
13 right get 13 14 maybe 20 down the

181
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,839
alphabet is as far as i'd usually go uh

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,759
so that is where the arise e comes from

183
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,279
we have found a specific phenotype that

184
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,439
i kept it was just a plant that i went i

185
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,758
like that one and the cup or the pot or

186
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,120
the label happened to be labeled a rise

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,439
number and i know it's a letter but it's

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
a rise number e so i kept that one

189
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,360
because i liked it for a specific reason

190
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,598
that is where the letter schemes come

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,879
from now let's talk about these arise

192
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,279
letter indications uh there was arise

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,439
number four there was number seven there

194
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,679
was number eight there is number e and

195
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
there was number a were my five

196
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,639
favorites of all time growing thousands

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,079
of seeds of arise

198
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
ah then there were the two males of

199
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,839
course the king solomon and the golden

200
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
goat looking male so i've got seven that

201
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,879
stuck around at this time i have

202
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,159
eliminated all of the females except

203
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,839
number four number four is a stud not a

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
stud number four is a champion if it was

205
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,719
a stud it'd be a dude uh number four is

206
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,318
[ __ ] awesome number four is an

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
amazing plan number four is a keeper

208
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
it's got the potency that i look for

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
it's got the vigor that i look for it's

210
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,719
got the bud uh density and shape and

211
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,038
type that i look for it's got leaf shape

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
that i look for it's got plant structure

213
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,800
it is the champion it does all of the

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
things that i wanted my arize plant to

215
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,319
do so number four has stuck around uh

216
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,719
number four was the uh the perfect one i

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
can't even it's the one that was the one

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
i'm gonna try to remember off the top of

219
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,638
my head here number eight uh was good it

220
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
was more golden goatee and a little bit

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,560
more sativa number e i think was the

222
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,119
super real tall real long finisher real

223
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
psychedelic finishing phenotype so i

224
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
don't have a list of which phenotype was

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,599
which here it's a lot to remember when

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,598
you get into breeding a lot of strains

227
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,319
and trying to remember specific phenos

228
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,319
but that is where the letters come from

229
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
so you'll see this in other breeders

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
you'll see it in my work a lot of time

231
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,800
uh you'll see a rise so there's right

232
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,239
now available and this is what my friend

233
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,918
inspired our friend john's question

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,199
right now available is a rise f2 number

235
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,680
four and a rise f2 number e and a rise

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,120
f2 uh number seven those have been

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
distributed and shared with friends i

238
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
shouldn't say available because uh those

239
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
are probably gone by the time you hear

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,918
this but those have been made and our

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,158
friends are getting those so why did i

242
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,439
call them f2 number e

243
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,080
because

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
i probably used the same male in a batch

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,639
right i got the one male i was king

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
solomon and then i had five different

247
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,399
females of a rise in there and they were

248
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
all labeled the different phenotypes

249
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,958
from which they came from from their

250
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,600
original phenohat so there was a rise f1

251
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,278
number four a rise f1 number two all the

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
way up there were five of them that were

253
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,439
selected we had number four number seven

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,519
number eight numbers a and number e and

255
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
then those all got pollinated by the

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,600
king solomon to make the f2 and now that

257
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:18,159
became a rise f2 number a

258
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
or a rise number af2 i'm not sure how i

259
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,519
labeled it either way as long as the f2

260
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,519
and the number a is indicated in there

261
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,320
that is to let you know let the consumer

262
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,240
know which phenotype of the female i use

263
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
which female phenotype of the arise i

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
use because it will make a difference uh

265
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,679
the number four will stay shorter and

266
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,600
squattier the e is going to get real

267
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,278
tall like a fishing pole so that does

268
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
make a difference you've also seen me do

269
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,159
this in the jack the ripper f2s there

270
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,679
are jack the ripper f2 number two number

271
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,519
three number four and number five i

272
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,039
believe is how i numbered those so those

273
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,679
are also available with different

274
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,958
numbers you'll see another seed company

275
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,239
um we're not going to bring anybody

276
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,359
else's names into this but you'll see

277
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,360
they do version a and version b which is

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
just simply probably i'm assuming they

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,879
had a they grew from seed they found two

280
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,720
really stellar keepers that were

281
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,240
different but they were both keepers for

282
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,160
different reasons so they bred them to

283
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
the same male so let's just say that

284
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,319
i've got i grow a batch of seeds and i

285
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,720
find two stellar females one is super

286
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
potent and really uh super potent we'll

287
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,278
just focus on the potency of this one

288
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
and then i've got another one that

289
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,600
[ __ ] tastes super good so i've got a

290
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
version a and a version b as long as i

291
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,639
make a note of which is which then it's

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
cool to have two different versions not

293
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,679
a big deal you could sell them both

294
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,959
advertise them both mark and them both

295
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,639
grow them both as long as people know

296
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,719
what they're getting the flavor or the

297
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,039
potency then what's to stop me from

298
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,680
taking a male one male and pollinating

299
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,000
both of them and offering the

300
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,679
uh version a and version b of the same

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,759
cross we could name it the same thing

302
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,039
you could call it uh fist bump that's a

303
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,639
cool strain name don't [ __ ] steal

304
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,879
that fist bump i'm claiming that strain

305
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,039
name that could be fist bump version one

306
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,720
and fist bump version two that wouldn't

307
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,639
be a problem just list what the parents

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
were and that's two different two

309
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,559
different crosses of the same thing

310
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,639
basically so that is why we see letters

311
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,199
in there thank you for inspiring me to

312
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,120
ramble and rant about letters and weird

313
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
seed package labels i hope i covered

314
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
some ground there and i hope any of that

315
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,319
was useful to some of you folks out

316
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,518
there who may have seed packs with

317
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,278
version two or version b or phenotype a

318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,639
written on the package that's why we're

319
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,720
doing it the breeder is trying to give

320
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,559
you as much detailed information as we

321
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
can share with you on the package to

322
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,119
where you know what you're working with

323
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,479
i'd like you to know what you're working

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,799
with i like to know what i'm working

325
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,278
with it makes it easy set yourself up

326
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,120
for success all right i am rambling

327
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,039
let's keep me back on track and move to

328
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
the next message this one is great this

329
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,278
one came from our friend mark

330
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
and it goes a lot like this it says yo

331
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,360
rasta jeff i just watched your show

332
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,679
about reversing male plants and i was

333
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,399
curious if female plants can detect a

334
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,319
male plant nearby and if so how is it a

335
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
pheromone the male plant emits or is it

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,519
something else thanks for all you do and

337
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,320
i will give my mom a hug kind regards

338
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,039
from mark this is a great question i

339
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,839
don't have any scientifical data any

340
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,000
real evidence other than uh observation

341
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,040
personal observation i've been growing

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,039
for years i've been cultivating in

343
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,120
small scales and large scales for a long

344
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,759
time i've had the privilege of having

345
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,679
male plants in the same room same houses

346
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,958
female plants and attempting and

347
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,439
successfully

348
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,838
finishing a seedless sensamia crop in

349
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,320
one room while pollinating another crop

350
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,040
in another room of the same house

351
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,519
so the evidence that i do have uh may

352
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,278
may be uh useful the scientific report i

353
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,919
have may be useful but this is what i

354
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,480
have observed when i do have females in

355
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,078
one room and they are waiting for pollen

356
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
and they know there's a male plant in

357
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,399
the other room who's starting to ski i

358
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
do believe and i do see those female

359
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,919
plants

360
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,278
flowering more quickly and producing

361
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,120
more pistols it looks like they're

362
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,439
putting off more spaces to receive the

363
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,278
pollen i've seen this a couple of times

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
i feel like they get stickier they get

365
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,519
more pistols and they do grow more

366
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,199
rapidly i don't know what causes it i

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
will give you credit for the idea or the

368
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
assumption that it's a pheromone or

369
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
something similar because that would

370
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,399
make sense uh when i smell my girl come

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
into the room i do get excited so maybe

372
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
that boy plant maybe those girl plants

373
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,799
know the other one is there and they're

374
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,639
just smelling each other and just

375
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,639
getting horny and starting to make more

376
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,799
flowers so that the magic can happen

377
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,560
also i do notice that uh if i'm just

378
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,719
collecting pollen and there's no females

379
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,159
around the dudes don't produce as much

380
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
pollen as they would if there were

381
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,439
actually females in the room that's

382
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,639
something else that i've noticed so i do

383
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
think the plants know that they are

384
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,639
there i think the plants can detect the

385
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,078
presence of the opposite sex i think

386
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,079
they can detect the presence of other

387
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,120
plants i also think they can detect the

388
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,799
presence of pests and the presence of us

389
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,799
i've said it before

390
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,719
those plants think that i'm just the

391
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,319
delivery mechanism the delivery guy that

392
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
shows up with calmag that's all the

393
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
plants think that i'm there for they're

394
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,679
like is he here he's got the cow mag yay

395
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
that's that's all the plants think about

396
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,039
me and they're grateful that i gave it

397
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,879
to them so i do think that the plants

398
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,719
know i do think they get stickier i

399
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,120
think they start flowering more quickly

400
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,879
and they do get more pistols so i think

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,159
that's a great answer to your question i

402
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,480
don't have a lot of scientifical

403
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,879
evidence behind that other than i've

404
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
bred in the same house uh and i've seen

405
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,120
the plants get stickier because i think

406
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,159
they knew that their date was on the

407
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
other side of the room just getting

408
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,198
prepped for them she's over there

409
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
putting on her perfume and shaving her

410
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,078
legs and that dude was up there doing

411
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,198
push-ups until we introduce them all

412
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,359
right that is enough of that one i've

413
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,799
been rambling on um there's one more

414
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
great question that i did receive i did

415
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,319
not print it because my printer ran out

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,159
of paper so i just took a quick note of

417
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,560
it this one said hey ross to jeff why is

418
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,559
some stuff only available in femme seed

419
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,319
and other lines are only available in

420
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,799
regular seeds that is a very good

421
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,639
question as a seed breeder i've got a

422
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,879
very good answer for that

423
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,879
why is some stuff only available let's

424
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,879
start off with femci that is the easiest

425
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,278
answer why is some stuff only available

426
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,240
in fams i have to start off by teaching

427
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,958
you about what is known as a clone only

428
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,959
golden goat is what we call a clone only

429
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,719
when the maker the original breeder of

430
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,039
golden goat who was not me i've got to

431
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,639
give mr dank and topeka kansas credit

432
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,919
for breeding the golden goat i did not

433
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
breathe that a lot of people give me the

434
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,278
credit did not do it don't want the

435
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,958
credit i made enough of my own stuff

436
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,600
don't need to steal credit for that one

437
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,198
however golden goat is a clone only

438
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,440
which means when the original breeder

439
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,759
made the golden goat they did not give

440
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,079
out any clones or seeds of other

441
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,078
phenotypes of that cultivar they've got

442
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,399
so the breeder made a handful of seeds

443
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,559
right he grew them he found the winner

444
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,799
he shared that one did not give anything

445
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,119
else out there are no seeds to be had of

446
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,278
the golden goat so it is a clone only

447
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,440
there's that one female clone which

448
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,838
means there is no real true male golden

449
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,320
goat plant which brings us to why there

450
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,720
are only femme seeds because

451
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,199
imagine if you only had one rhinoceros

452
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,759
and it was a female make more rhinos you

453
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,838
need some sperm or a male rhino to do

454
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,800
that and with golden goat there's only a

455
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,360
female so we cannot make regular golden

456
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,439
goat seeds unless we adulterate it which

457
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
i have taken the liberty of doing so i

458
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,959
have pollinated that with another plant

459
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,959
we've done some work to it we have done

460
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,198
what is known as a back cross i've done

461
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,838
full episodes on back crossing back

462
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,078
crossing is the solution when you want

463
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,040
seeds of a plant that is only a clone

464
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,278
only no male exists there are ways to

465
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,198
kind of replicate recreate uh what's it

466
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,600
called reverse engineer may be the

467
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,319
better word to create a line that is uh

468
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,000
non which is a clone only which has a no

469
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
male pollen donor available there are

470
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
ways to work around that but

471
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,480
that's an adulteration that is not a

472
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,198
pure version of that plant so if we make

473
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,879
feminized seeds we only need that female

474
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,399
plant because in a female pro in a

475
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,399
feminized process

476
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
i would take uh we're gonna stick with

477
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,078
golden goat i would take a clone of the

478
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,919
golden goat i would take another clone

479
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,479
of the golden goat these are both golden

480
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,240
goat clones i would treat one clone with

481
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,039
a solution i've done a full episode on

482
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
this

483
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,759
that solution would cause this golden go

484
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,560
plant to make pollen which is only

485
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,240
female pollen which also only contains

486
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,319
golden goat chromosomes there's only the

487
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,240
genetics of golden goat so we are not

488
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
adulterating the golden goat line i'm

489
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
going to take that golden goat pollen

490
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,038
and put it on a golden go female now we

491
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,798
have made golden goat s1 we have selfed

492
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,599
our golden goat which all those seeds

493
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,160
will be very very close to the original

494
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,318
golden goat so that is why some things

495
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
are available only in feminized seed

496
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,918
because it was a clone only plant

497
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
meaning there were no seeds which means

498
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,839
there was no male which means if we

499
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,558
wanted to create a seed from that it

500
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,000
either needs to be self or adulterated

501
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,839
and many people don't want the

502
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,640
adulterated version of golden goat they

503
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,639
want the original pure version of golden

504
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
goat now let's talk about the other side

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,038
of that coin

506
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
many people are not fans of feminized

507
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,400
seeds back in the day many of the dutch

508
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,440
makers were not making femme seeds

509
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,038
properly

510
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
quality control was not what it should

511
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,519
be we figured it out now femmes are a

512
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,600
lot better but because of miseducation

513
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,279
or trial and error that didn't go well

514
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,119
many growers are

515
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,038
disgruntled or they have a bad taste in

516
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,599
their mouth or they are simply opposed

517
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,919
to using femme seeds

518
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,639
in that same vein many breeders are

519
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,400
opposed to making feminized seeds many

520
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,320
people that many people that make seeds

521
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
feel like making femmes is kind of a

522
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,839
dead end what do you do if you don't use

523
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
a male you've got to keep reversing

524
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,599
something in my opinion that is fine i

525
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,759
know a few other breeders that really

526
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,240
agree with the idea of using a an alpha

527
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,759
female plant something a really a badass

528
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,279
female plant could really make a lot of

529
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,960
good breeding projects but a lot of

530
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,038
breeders don't agree with that they only

531
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
want the natural selection of a male and

532
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,359
female plant so that is why a lot of

533
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,879
things are only available in regular

534
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,798
seed because

535
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
when you make a cross you take a male

536
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,000
plant and a female plant you put the

537
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,440
pollen on the female it makes a lot of

538
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,839
seeds now you've got your cross that

539
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,400
happens naturally that is easy to do

540
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,038
creating feminized seeds from that line

541
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,120
is a different line of work it involves

542
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,960
treating a select it involves selecting

543
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,798
a plant to be a pollen donor it involves

544
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,120
selecting female plants to receive that

545
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,440
pollen then it also involves treating

546
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,839
the selected pollen donor with a

547
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
chemical solution uh a certain amount of

548
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,199
times there's work to be done you've got

549
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,720
to treat a plant you've got to reverse

550
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
it you've got to do some manipulation

551
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,160
then you've got to make the pollen

552
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
happen you've got to chuck the pollen

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,558
and then honestly um when i make red

554
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
seeds i get 50

555
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,399
more seed than i do when i make feminize

556
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
seed that's why femme seeds are twice as

557
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
expensive

558
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,000
they cost twice as much to make they

559
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,240
take twice as long to make so a lot of

560
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,720
seeds are only available in reg seed

561
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,038
because a feminized grower a feminized

562
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,160
breeder has not taken the time to create

563
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,000
a feminized line from that project or

564
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
that product it's a whole other step

565
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,919
it's a lot more work it could be

566
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,519
it could be six nine maybe 12 more

567
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,320
months worth of work to get that

568
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,119
feminized line out to you so the reason

569
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,439
why some things are available in fem is

570
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,519
because uh the breeder a breeder like

571
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
myself that is interested in making fems

572
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,720
has done the work to make the femme

573
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
seeds available the reason why some

574
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
stuff is only available in rags is

575
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
because some breeders they either

576
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,960
haven't done it yet or they are just not

577
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
interested in making stuff in regular

578
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
seed a lot of the times that fem is

579
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
because it was only available as a clone

580
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,558
only and the only way you're going to

581
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,038
get seeds of it is through making fems

582
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,720
so i hope i answered that question

583
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,400
i do have a lot of other episodes about

584
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
back crosses about femme seeds i do

585
