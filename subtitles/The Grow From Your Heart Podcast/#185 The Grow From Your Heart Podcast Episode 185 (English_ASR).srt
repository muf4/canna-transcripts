he is you know I don't know the exact

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,329
title to tell you the truth he is a very

95
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,810
high position with a dispensary known as

96
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,310
organic ax in Albuquerque New Mexico if

97
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,170
you are in New Mexico and you are a

98
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,329
medical marijuana patient in New Mexico

99
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,909
I can highly recommend organic organic

100
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,799
a-- has several great strains this is an

101
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,139
and not an dad you guys this is just how

102
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,450
I feel Organic a-- has a rise on the

103
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,509
shelves most of the time there arise has

104
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,488
tested at 32% THC so you might want to

105
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,739
try that if you're a New Mexico medical

106
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,750
marijuana patient they've got Zack Hayes

107
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,489
Zack Hayes is named after a friend of

108
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,739
ours who unfortunately passed away of

109
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,239
cystic fibrosis but he's got a strain

110
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,519
named after him so he will live forever

111
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,959
within the cannabis community big shout

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,420
out to Zack much love Missy little

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,549
brother but here's what I was getting at

114
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,530
with my talk about organic in New Mexico

115
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,420
a friend of mine was talking about

116
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,620
needing medical marijuana in New Mexico

117
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,659
and I said hey bro why don't you just

118
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,730
drive up to argh Antica and go visit him

119
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,379
and get some of that arise and he said I

120
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,328
would love to but I'm in the southern

121
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,459
part of the state and I was like what

122
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,980
does that mean and he replied with

123
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,870
there's a border check there and I

124
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,489
thought a border check in New Mexico

125
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,370
said yeah between when you're coming

126
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,679
north from Las Cruces New Mexico on i-25

127
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,910
there is a border check and they are

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
checking and it's also as you're going

129
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,350
south if you're going south to Las

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,990
Cruces on i-25 there's a border check

131
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,370
and they stop you and ask you when

132
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,870
you're coming north they ask you if

133
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,430
you've been to Mexico and they ask you

134
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,649
if you have any illegal people in your

135
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,400
car and when I went through it was

136
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:46,259
myself you guys I am white I'm super

137
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,659
white there's no mistaking me for a

138
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,569
white guy racial profiling or not I'm a

139
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,639
white dude my beard comes in kind of red

140
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,069
my beard comes in quite red I'm got

141
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,650
blond hair blue eyes I say dude and bro

142
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,149
I am white there's no doubt about it the

143
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,679
guy that was with me looks like he could

144
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,388
be my brother he's my best friend robbed

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,590
the dude when we went through that

146
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,569
checkpoint they're like what's up guys

147
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:08,219
did you go to Mexico and I said no and

148
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,509
he ran our plates and he pretty much

149
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,180
sent us on our way he knew we were

150
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,949
Gringo's so they're looking for illegal

151
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,860
aliens and they're looking for drugs

152
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,478
coming north going to the South they

153
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,009
were never looking for anything until

154
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,839
now now they're looking for people

155
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,329
taking their medical marijuana through

156
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,619
that checkpoint I was confused but then

157
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,259
I gave it about two seconds of thought

158
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,870
and I said holy [ __ ] they can't drive

159
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,379
their medical marijuana so these guys

160
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,788
are their medical marijuana patients in

161
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,439
the state of New Mexico they have

162
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,360
purchased medical marijuana in New

163
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,759
Mexico and they cannot travel through

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,280
that state checkpoint because it is a

165
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,629
federally run checkpoint and if they get

166
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,698
caught with marijuana they will be

167
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,589
charged with possession of cannabis or

168
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,240
whatever the charges are and they will

169
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,679
probably take the weed at the least and

170
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,259
they'll probably arrest and charge them

171
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,300
for crossing a federal border with

172
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,439
cannabis I thought that was very

173
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,728
interesting I just wanted to share that

174
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,098
with you guys

175
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:03,689
man if you're in New Mexico go to org

176
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:05,610
antica unless you have to try to sneak

177
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,860
through that border I cannot suggest to

178
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,569
anybody trying to sneak through a Border

179
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,610
Patrol checkpoint with cannabis in your

180
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,870
car if you're a medical marijuana

181
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,129
patient and you're having problems like

182
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,269
that getting your herb and having to

183
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,909
travel with it you know what I'm gonna

184
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,680
say grow your own cannabis that's the

185
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,490
best way to do it all right you know how

186
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,199
you can learn how to grow your own

187
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,150
cannabis this is a super smooth segue

188
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,800
you can listen to old episodes of the

189
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,968
girl from your heart a podcast before it

190
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,949
was the girl from a heart podcast it was

191
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:31,339
called agriculture and I've been putting

192
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,529
old episodes together in large

193
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,789
I've been putting if three episodes fit

194
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,439
in a block I've been putting three

195
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,900
episodes together and re releasing them

196
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,250
as one episode it may not always work

197
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,589
that way because some episodes are gonna

198
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,089
be longer some are shorter I may only be

199
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,279
able to fit two I may be able to fit

200
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,669
four or five if the episodes are sure it

201
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,319
looks like my recording software and

202
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,150
where I post my podcast it looks like

203
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,129
just over three hours is kind of the

204
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,799
limit for what I can put out so I try to

205
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,689
go pretty close to three hours I've put

206
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,610
out episodes one through three and one

207
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:04,069
chunk and then I put out episodes four

208
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,350
five and six and another chunk and after

209
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,180
I record this I will put together the

210
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,490
next two chunks of episodes and I'll

211
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,870
release those hopefully on the next two

212
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,269
Thursdays I've been dropping them on

213
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,879
Thursdays so if you haven't noticed in

214
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:18,560
the feed the old episodes are up there

215
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,000
you guys just go look through the feed

216
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,879
through the titles and it says one

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
through three revisited and four through

218
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,379
six revisited and I plan on keeping that

219
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,329
going until I catch up and I'm doing it

220
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,879
in chunks because people are asking for

221
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,469
old episodes and instead of just

222
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,149
dropping the old episodes back in

223
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,830
because what happens is every time a new

224
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:38,209
episode comes out an old episode gets

225
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,189
knocked out of the feeder only holds a

226
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,019
hundred so instead of just putting in

227
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,790
one I'm putting in three and you're kind

228
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:45,469
of getting more more value out of it

229
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,330
that way without losing something that's

230
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,620
my attempt because if I just put one

231
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:51,259
through three then it would knock out

232
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,879
whatever the bottom three were I'm just

233
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,420
I'm trying to make it make sense for

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,329
everybody

235
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,430
that's my goal also another solution I

236
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:00,500
came up with to archive old episodes was

237
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,110
YouTube YouTube does not limit how many

238
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,389
things you post I can post a thousand

239
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,340
episodes to YouTube so I have slowly

240
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,439
been going and making old videos for the

241
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,899
old episodes I've got one through 25

242
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,969
completed they are loaded to youtube but

243
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,979
they are not public yet I'm going to try

244
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,050
to get up to 50 episodes before I make

245
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,420
it public because people listen to

246
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,910
things and such large chunks that if I

247
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,620
don't put 50 of them up there the minute

248
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,600
I release it somebody is going to tweet

249
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,420
me and say listen to all 50 I need more

250
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,800
so let me get 50 up there then I'll make

251
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,960
them public you guys can listen and

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,340
hopefully while you savages dig through

253
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,220
those old episodes I'll be able to

254
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,990
produce the next 20 or so and try to

255
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,870
stay ahead of you guys and I'm going to

256
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,690
do it until I'm caught up currently I'm

257
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,250
recording episode 185 and I've got 25

258
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,500
videos made so I've got a hundred and

259
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,929
sixty videos that I need to make and it

260
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,339
takes a little bit of time I apologize

261
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:55,329
for the quality of the first

262
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,860
twenty-something videos I wasn't real

263
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,379
good with the record with the video

264
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,259
making software and honestly I'm just

265
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,269
kind of phoning in the first 50 to get

266
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:06,610
them done I'm cutting and pasting images

267
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,980
in so it's just the same images repeated

268
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,509
but you're getting the full audio which

269
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,370
is my goal it's all about the audio

270
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,889
there'll be some cool images but it's

271
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,179
all about the audio the first 21 videos

272
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,338
are actually up if you guys would like

273
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:19,809
to go to I just go to youtube and search

274
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,339
for the girl from your heart a podcast

275
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,039
it's really easy to find you can

276
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,920
actually watch the first 21 or 22 videos

277
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,480
and let me know what you think also if

278
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,819
you listen to those old episodes please

279
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,200
tweet me and give me some critiques and

280
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,020
opinions I'd love to know what you think

281
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,910
of those old episodes tweet me at G fyh

282
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,250
podcast I would love to hear your

283
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,329
opinions of the old stuff a lot of

284
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,009
people aren't into Twitter and social

285
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,389
media so if you want to contact me and

286
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,399
let me know what you think you can send

287
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:49,720
me an email and grow from your heart at

288
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:52,088
hotmail.com and speaking of emails that

289
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,190
brings me to the topic of the show you

290
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,320
guys I received an email it's kind of

291
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,990
long but it brought up so many good

292
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,810
questions that I could not ignore it so

293
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,740
I'm gonna take a phat dab I might take

294
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,389
three or four dabs

295
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,649
to tell you honest truth actually I

296
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,539
think I'm gonna take a dab of this

297
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,278
solvent less hash that my buddy Chandler

298
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,958
gave me for my birthday dude thanks for

299
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,429
the solvent list it's delicious I'm

300
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,169
gonna take a phat dab of it right now

301
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:16,120
and then I'll probably take a dab of

302
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,949
summer rise and then I'll probably take

303
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,389
a dab of cactus cooler and then I'll

304
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,060
probably finish off with a dab of

305
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,679
Cascade and then I'm going to come back

306
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,629
and we will read an email from our

307
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,709
friend who calls himself the tri-county

308
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:43,299
bandit from Florida

309
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:46,340
[Music]

310
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:49,189
Podcast world I am back and I have a

311
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,530
confession to make I could not take all

312
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,060
four of the dabs I mentioned I took a

313
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,000
dab of that solvent list that Chandler

314
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,500
gave me and I got super high and I

315
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,080
copped for like three minutes and had to

316
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,690
go blow my nose I thought I'd be cool to

317
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,040
take a dab of that cactus cooler and I

318
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,110
went in a little deeper than I thought I

319
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,360
went in and I had to blow my nose again

320
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,159
and cop for like six or seven minutes so

321
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,300
the past ten minutes of my life have

322
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,389
just been me taking to Dad's and

323
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:16,789
coughing but I am back and I'm gonna

324
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,470
shake off this [ __ ] dab comb I just

325
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,879
put myself into and we're going to read

326
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,629
an email I'm pulling up the email right

327
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,889

333
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,189

don't feel that that one's crew

368

to get out right away but I've got it

369
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,259
it's on the first page now when I open

370
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,819
the book all the other episodes have

371
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,830
been done the pages have been torn out

372

that one's the first one I see so the

373
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,100
building and auto watering drip system

374
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,170
that one's coming up I've got more

375
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,990
episodes about how to identify and take

376
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:02,579
care of pests we're gonna do thrips next

377

378
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,259
about like how to identify light leaks

379

and pH problems and overfed I've got a

380
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,100
whole bunch more content coming up plus

381
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,079
I need to get the dabbing granny and

382
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,460
white mic on a podcast together they

383
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,520
have never sat down and done a show

384
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,750
together I want to make that happen I've

385
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,819
got a lot of stuff coming up so I'm not

386
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,159
going to stop making podcasts for a

387
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,320
really long time that I can pretty much

388
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,209
promise you unless something terrible

389
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,800
happens and I will still work through it

390
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,470
that's just how it goes

391
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,569
anyway the email goes on and says you

392
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,210
always say that your that your fan base

393
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,550
listens to about 30 to 45 minutes shows

394
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,830
or my response to that is they ain't

395
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:41,389
real fans bro I'm in it for the long

396
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,920
haul

397
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,029
well not everybody can be in it for the

398
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,490
long haul bro they're not out there

399
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,279
killing bugs for eight hours a day some

400
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,409
people have a DD and they don't listen

401
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,539
to a long podcast I prefer a long

402
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:57,000
podcast myself I like it

403
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,740
why go when I go to the grow the big

404
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,389
grow I'm there from 6:00 in the morning

405
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,879
or 7:00 in the morning till 6:00 at

406
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:04,319
night usually I'm there for a long time

407
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,600
and just like yourself I like to put in

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,980
a podcast hit play and then not have to

409
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,470
reach back into my pocket for another

410
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,879
two hours to hit play again ah that's

411
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,680
why I listen to stuff like Joe Rogan

412
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,230
because he's on for three or four hours

413
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,759
just [ __ ] rambling I like Joey Diaz

414
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,500
cuz he's on for quite a while

415
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,539
I like the Steve Simone good times

416
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,769
podcast because that one's long I like

417
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,240
Doug Stanhope cuz they're just

418
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,129
ridiculous and that one's kind of long

419
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,269
but you're right longer episodes are

420
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,429
cool it's why I've been trying to put

421
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,009
out longer episodes when it's just me ah

422
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,959
30 or 45 minutes is enough I can't even

423
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,639
listen to myself for much longer than

424
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,320
that but thank you for the compliment

425
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,899
and for wanting more that makes me feel

426
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,280
great that people want more it's better

427
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,539
to know that people want more than

428
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,399
hearing that people are [ __ ] sick of

429
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,990
me and they're like dude shut up I would

430
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,029
rather say I'd rather hear people say

431
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,649
give me more so that's awesome the email

432
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,209
keeps going it says like this I listen

433
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,769
to four hour plus shows on my phone

434
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,019
because I got to kill eight hours a day

435
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,429
not saying you got to make longer shows

436
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,970
bro just letting you know people are

437
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,278
digging the content and don't

438
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,350
ever sell yourself short I appreciate

439
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,328
that I don't think it's selling myself

440
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,159
short that people listen to 36 minutes

441
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:09,250
of a podcast that's just what statistics

442
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,750
on my end show and that's what ad D

443
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,100
shows me honestly and most people are

444
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,899
probably driving to work or something

445
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,310
when they listen not everybody's got a

446
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,500
job like us where they could put on the

447
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,078
earbuds and listen for eight hours at a

448
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,309
time I love it when I can though the day

449
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,679
goes by so quickly

450
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:25,268
I go into work check out the to-do list

451
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,068
figure out what do I got to do I get set

452
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,480
up for a couple of things and then once

453
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,458
everybody kind of goes our separate ways

454
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,319
I throw a linear buds and I hit play and

455
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,208
all a man by the time that's break time

456
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,458
that podcast is over and I'm like yes

457
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,909
time just traveled it's so sweet but I

458
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,919
love it

459
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:42,219
let's see you've got a grow question oh

460
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,378
you also said no homo bro but I love

461
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,120
your attitude and personality I wish I

462
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,789
lived close by cuz I would definitely

463
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,560
smoke you out bro bro I would love that

464
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,870
I would probably dab you out and get you

465
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,250
so high that you had to crash on my

466
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,379
couch for a couple of minutes cuz a lot

467
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,169
of times that happens here then you go

468
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:02,289
on to say okay on to my grow question

469
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:03,519

470
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,659

471
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,068
getting used to it this is like the

472
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,318
second or third email of yours I've read

473
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:10,058
on the show so we're getting used to

474
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,828
your long this it's cool do your thing

475
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:14,169
you go like this just add it a little

476
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:16,628
walk in AC to my grow and wanted to know

477
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:19,240
how cold is too cold before I start

478
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:21,430
seeing slowed down I'm just so used to

479
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,129
90 to a hundred degrees all day every

480
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:27,039
day in outdoor Florida weather that when

481
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:29,949
I go into a 70 to 75 degree grow it just

482
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:32,139
seems unnatural I know I don't want my

483
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,750
indoor grow at 90 or 100 I'm just

484
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,669
observing what works in nature

485
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,500
I have never grown I've never had to

486
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:40,990
grow this hot I'm just asking

487
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,990
I also see that increased timpz

488
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,149
decreased THC or degrades it and it also

489
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,318
caused the smell to kind of dwindle off

490
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:51,698
how do them Outdoor guys pull it off he

491
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:53,078
goes on to say maybe Colorado is

492
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:55,778
different because it's cold most of the

493
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,149
time but does that mean all outdoor

494
00:16:55,778 --> 00:17:00,159
comes out looking like regs there's got

495
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,019
to be a way to keep all that goodness I

496
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,610
think of them Afghani plants on the

497
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,798
mountains they get little newts happy

498
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,480
Sun and barely water then again I never

499
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,279
smoked that [ __ ] it's probably whack

500
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,870
that shit's probably dirty in the

501
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,058
genetics or gold and

502
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:16,599
No explain this to me because we always

503
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:18,430
say that environment is key there's more

504
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,799
to the email but I kind of want to stop

505
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,328
here and talk about some of the

506
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,430
questions you've asked and things that

507
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:26,379
you have said so the first actual

508
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,910
question you asked was how cold can you

509
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,550
get your grow room before you start

510
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,550
seeing slowed growth or problems during

511
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:37,000
the day I would try to keep it around 74

512
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:39,279
at the lowest I try to go you can go up

513
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,349
to like 84 80 at the highest but I try

514
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,109
to hover around 77 is where I keep my

515
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:46,480
grow and I think things go very well at

516
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:48,579
77 degrees now you can get them down to

517
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,160
the 69 ish if you really want to but

518
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:52,509
there's no need for that 65 will really

519
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,820
start slowing down the growth you'll see

520
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:57,609
problems during the night you can get

521
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:59,649
down to like 65 that's okay one thing I

522
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,990
would really pay attention to don't have

523
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,179
a huge change in temperature from day to

524
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,990
night don't have more than a 10 degree

525
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,550
difference

526
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,880
so if during the day your grow is

527
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:13,058
getting to 75 77 at night try not to get

528
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,150
lower than 65 or 67 degrees keep a 10

529
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:17,440
degree fluctuation and no more any more

530
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,300
of a change like that and you will

531
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,630
really be promoting powdery mildew

532
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,669
growth

533
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,590
and also it'll kind of shock and freak

534
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,450
the plants out a little bit so you can

535
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:28,599
get down during the day to like the low

536
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,700
70s I at night the low to mid 60's

537
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,039
and I wouldn't really go any cooler than

538
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,380
that you mentioned in this email vet

539
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,149
when you go into your 70 to 75 degree

540
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,010
grow it just seems unnatural since sir

541
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,780
you're so used to growing your plants

542
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:42,789
and at 90 to 100 degree environment

543
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,619
outdoors in Florida that's

544
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,599
understandable but this plant the

545
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:49,419
cannabis plant is an amazing plant and

546
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,519
it loves to adjust cannabis is a very

547
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,500
adaptable plant in your message you

548
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,990
start talking about how you see that

549
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,210
increased timpz decrease THC or degrade

550
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,039
it and it also kind of causes the smell

551
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,410
to dwindle off and you asked about how

552
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,879
them outdoor guys pull it off then you

553
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,259
mentioned that maybe in Colorado it's

554
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,010
different because it's cold most of the

555
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:11,470
time but that is not true that's a

556
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:14,529
misconception Colorado gets hot as

557
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,360
during the summer a lot of the outdoor

558
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,970
commercial grows are in Pueblo Colorado

559
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,529
where I am this is what is known as the

560
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,240
desert and sometimes it's called the

561
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,329
high desert we are at the base of the

562
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,788
mountains we are not up in the hills

563
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,168
it gets really high here I've seen like

564
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,669
a hundred and six and I know that

565
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:32,220
doesn't sound super hot to you guys in

566
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,320
Florida because it's a super dry heat

567
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,970
here but it gets really hot and that dry

568
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,648
heat just sucks all of the moisture out

569
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,839
of your skin down south when he gets hot

570
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:41,639
there's water in the air your hair gets

571
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,470
fluffy your skin gets weird and your all

572
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,990
your clothes feel damp and Colorado when

573
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,490
it gets hot it is dry it feels like all

574
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,079
of your moisture in your body just

575
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,569
evaporated it feels like you're touching

576
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,898
the Sun because you're so up so high so

577
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:56,250
it does get hot here in Colorado don't

578
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:58,199
don't be confused and think that it's

579
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,359
cold here all the time we do have some

580
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,380
crazy temperature swings during the end

581
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,449
of growing season

582
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,580
it'll be really warm outside during the

583
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,419
day and then at night it'll be really

584
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,000
really cold

585
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,500
it'll almost snow and then it'll be warm

586
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,970
to wear you can wear shorts during the

587
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,909
day the next day and then it will almost

588
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,220
snow the next night so we see some huge

589
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,570
swings but it's not always cold anyway

590
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,870
let me get back on track with the email

591
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:25,168
when you mention increased temps ruined

592
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:27,058
THC and it ruins the smell that is more

593
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,639
likely in an indoor grow environment

594
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:31,349
because the bulbs create heat that are

595
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:34,079
really that is really close to the

596
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,759
plants when it's the sunshine and it's

597
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,470
just environmental heat the plants can

598
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,740
kind of adjust because they're outdoors

599
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,659
nature outdoors is king god it's sort of

600
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,970
a nerd nature versus nurture sort of a

601
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,799
thing outdoors yeah it's a hundred

602
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,659
degrees but they're getting as much

603
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,548
fresh air as they can possibly handle

604
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:51,990
the roots if you've got them in the dirt

605
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:54,000
in the ground they can stretch out

606
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,649
really far and find the nutrients and

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,619
find the fresh air and find the water

608
00:20:55,648 --> 00:21:00,629
that the roots may need indoors you can

609
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,949
give them everything that they need and

610
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,470
everything that you want to give them

611
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,000
but you're only able to supply so much

612
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,819
air you can only give them so much

613
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,440
oxygen so much co2 they can only get so

614
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,359
much root space there are only so many

615
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,899
things you can control indoors and

616
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,548
honestly the Sun is the king you can

617
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,589
have so many issues with the cannabis

618
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:21,359
plant and put it under the Sun because

619
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:23,459
the Sun is so powerful that it will give

620
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,798
that plant the strength and energy to

621
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,889
fix whatever problem it's got and a grow

622
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,269
bulb just doesn't have the magic excuse

623
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,918
me if the grow bulb does not have the

624
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:34,380
magic that the Sun has you cannot

625
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,639
duplicate that nature magic so let me

626
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,100
loop back around cuz I did get a little

627
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:40,048
sidetracked yes the heat

628
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,000
from the bulbs and the stale air from a

629
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,250
grow room will contribute to the loss of

630
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,529
terpenes and the loss of potency because

631
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,480
you've got bulbs too close to buds and

632
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,668
those lights are just beating heat and

633
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,620
beating lumens and beating par Watts

634
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,679
down onto the trichomes and onto the

635
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:58,288
terpenoids and it's just destroying them

636
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,900
that doesn't happen as much outdoors but

637
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:02,759
you do get dirt and you do get rain and

638
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,250
you do get wind so you've got those

639
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,048
things to deal with also and the email

640
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,390
you ask how do them outdoor guys in

641
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:12,058
Colorado pull it off do they pull it off

642
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,190
with a lot of hard work and dedication a

643
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:16,048
lot of the people sleep at the grow they

644
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,640
sleep on site where the plants are so

645
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:19,408
that they can wake up as soon as the Sun

646
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,509
comes up and they work until the Sun

647
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:22,830
Goes Down and there are actually people

648
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,509
that are in charge of checking on the

649
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:27,000
plants at night in case some [ __ ] goes

650
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:30,029
on weather-wise or an intruder wise or

651
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,369
animal wise that's a 24-hour job and

652
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,048
it's dedication that's how they do it so

653
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,788
you go on to talk about imagining this

654
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:38,069
Afghan cush plant on the side of a

655
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:40,440
mountain getting little newts heavy Sun

656
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,089
and barely any water honestly that's

657
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,880
probably some of the best cannabis on

658
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:46,649
the planet because of that plant it grew

659
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
there it probably got seeded

660
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,830
it was probably there are probably males

661
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,960
and females there right so that plant

662
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:55,379
grew there it got pollinated it

663
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,808
developed seed it dropped seed now it

664
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,580
remembered that last year it got beat to

665
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:01,980
[ __ ] by wind that it didn't get enough

666
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,089
water and it got way too much Sun so the

667
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,130
seeds that come out of that are gonna

668
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:06,808
remember that and they're gonna the

669
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,150
phenotypes that thrive in that

670
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:10,829
environment are going to survive and

671
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,360
they're going to breed and this there

672
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:13,259
are the phenotypes that don't thrive in

673
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,058
that environment

674
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,980
well die-off it's survival of the

675
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:19,139
fittest out there so the [ __ ] that has

676
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,669
been growing and breeding itself that

677
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,230
land race that's been happening out

678
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,030
there on whatever imaginary hillside

679
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,769
we're both talking about in Afghanistan

680
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,450
that nobody can ever find cuz it's so

681
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,548
hard to get to but the best [ __ ] weed

682
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,840
ever grows there and nobody even knows

683
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:32,879
no one ever smokes it it just keeps

684
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,740
growing and breeding itself that's

685
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,110
probably some of the best dankus [ __ ] on

686
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,089
the planet because it's adjusted to that

687
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:41,548
environment and it's in the most a

688
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:44,459
desirable environment for what it is

689
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:46,259
adjusted itself to through breeding

690
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,298
through evolution through selection

691
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,308
through natural selection so it's

692
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,420
probably pretty dank weed just through

693
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:54,299
nature

694
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,130
I feel like a lot of the time people get

695
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,569
in the way of the cannabis plant a lot

696
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,100
of times people are like dude what do I

697
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,269
need to do I did this I did this I did

698
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:02,129
this what do I need to do there's

699
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,420
something wrong with my plant and the

700
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,220
best thing I can tell them to do is just

701
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,380
leave it alone for a few days you've

702
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,180
done everything to it it's beat up it

703
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,280
needs a [ __ ] break give it a minute

704
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,140
and you got to you got to keep in mind

705
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,700
like this email says these plants grow

706
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,590
on the side of a Rocky Mountain where

707
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,509
nobody is I like to joke that he got

708
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:22,049
pissed on by a goat it got blown over by

709
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:23,700
the wind like it lives a rough life so

710
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,289
just leave it alone and let it do its

711
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,690
thing and sometimes that's the best for

712
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,149
a cannabis plant Wow it feels like I'm

713
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,130
super rambling you guys I've had a lot

714
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,590
of dr. pepper and a bunch of sativa dads

715
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,420
and I apologize if I'm just rambling my

716
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,799
ass off through this podcast I'm gonna

717
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,450
hit pause and I'm gonna do that thing

718
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,950
where I take dad's and drink and choke

719
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,990
and then hopefully that calms me down

720
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,269
and I will be right back

721
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,099
all right you guys I am back took a

722
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,900
couple of dad to drink some water I feel

723
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:51,240
like I'm more calm I feel like I'm Zen

724
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,460
and ready to do a podcast let's get back

725
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,599
into this email I did skip a couple of

726
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,250
paragraphs cuz there was some chitter

727
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,099
chatter and some personal stuff going on

728
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,720
and then he gets into this part right

729
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:03,240
here he says can you speak on the

730
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,759
differences between cuts and phenotypes

731
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,980
he says it sounds like if you give me a

732
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,839
cut of what you got in Colorado it will

733
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,640
form and express itself a little

734
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,980
differently at my place here in Florida

735
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,290
due to the environment but if I gave

736
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,970
that clone back to you in several years

737
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,950
would it be the same

738
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,559
would it revert back to what you had and

739
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,319
also does that mean that each strain has

740
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,210
endless phenotypes I always thought that

741
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,899
a phenotype was if you popped n beans

742
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:33,990
all ten of that each one will express

743
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,080
themselves in a different showing itself

744
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,980
to be a specific Fino so I'm gonna stop

745
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,569
right there there is more to the

746
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,480
question but I want to stop right there

747
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:44,879
and kind of catch up with some answers

748
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,650
yes if I gave you a clone of one of my

749
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,790
favorite plants that I've got here in

750
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,250
Colorado that I've been drawing for

751
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,230
several years and you took it to Florida

752
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,809
it would grow a little bit differently

753
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,730
if you drew it indoors or outdoors you

754
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,529
would not have to take it all the way to

755
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,930
Florida if we were doing this in indoor

756
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,980
grow rooms if you set up an indoor grow

757
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,019
room

758
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,940
you could probably do it in the same

759
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,119
building let's say we both rented a

760
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,350
warehouse somewhere in Denver we're just

761
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,909
going hypothetical and throwing darts at

762
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:13,469
maps here we both were in it we've

763
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,179
rented a warehouse together in Denver

764
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,970
we're Co partners on this warehouse

765
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,919
we've got a giant rectangle building we

766
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,350
draw wind down the middle we put a wall

767
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,240
up now we've got two squares you on one

768
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,769
side I own the other I build to grow my

769
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,259
way on one side you build to grow your

770
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:32,009
way on the other side I cut two clones

771
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:34,890
of grateful dog I give you a clone I

772
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,539
take a clone we both grow it for the see

773
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,009
we veg for the same amount of time and

774
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,649
we flower for the same amount of time

775
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:42,569
our plants are gonna look different very

776
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,240
minor details are going to make your

777
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:47,069
plants look different things like

778
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,509
nutrients will make your plants look

779
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:51,149
different I recently switched from

780
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,849
botanic hair to veg bloom powder

781
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,200
nutrients and my plants look completely

782
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,759
different I'm seeing colors I've never

783
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,950
seen from these plants before my

784
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,429
grateful dog plants are coming out a

785
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,350
really light purple color they are not

786
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:06,570
they used to come out like a dark I

787
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:08,219
don't know like a real dark dark purple

788
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,960
and now they're like a real light

789
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,308
lavender it's a really pretty purple

790
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,590
that I've never seen from these plants

791
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:15,389
before so the nutrients are making a

792
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:17,639
difference in phenotypical expression

793
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,799
temperatures will make a difference if

794
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,780
your grows a little colder or mine's a

795
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,440
little warmer it will make a difference

796
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:27,119
humidity can make a difference ah white

797
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,798
spectrum could make a difference if

798
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,918
you're growing with high pressure sodium

799
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,900
lamps and I'm growing with LEDs or maybe

800
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
we're growing with the exact same lights

801
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,900
and yours were three inches closer than

802
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
mine

803
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,040
you're going to see a little bit of a

804
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,500
difference just very small things like

805
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,599
that are going to make a difference and

806
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,000
a lot of what plays into that is the

807
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,069
stability of the plant and that goes

808
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,779
into breeding it depends on which

809
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,210
parents were selected and it also

810
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,500
depends on which generation you were

811
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,308
working with if you're working with the

812
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,079
f1 the f2 maybe up to the f5 the f5 is

813
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:03,269
gonna be a little more stable hopefully

814
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,928
if it was selected and bred properly the

815
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:09,418
f5 will show less variation that f1 may

816
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:12,000
show more variation depending on the

817
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,250
stability of that plant so yes you will

818
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,380
see variation if you took a plant to

819
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,420
Florida and grew it

820
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,460
let's see we did this outdoors just to

821
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,560
make it a little more intense because

822
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,329
our outdoor environment here in Colorado

823
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,730
is a little or very much like

824
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:27,859
Afghanistan where Rocky we're in the

825
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,650
mountains we have drastic temperature

826
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:31,729
swings we've got hot we've got cold so

827
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,860
then if you took a plant that's been

828
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,950
growing outdoors and then you took that

829
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:38,449
to Florida the leaves will look

830
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,580
differently because there's much more

831
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,470
humidity there I believe that the leaves

832
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:44,149
will get a little bit thinner where the

833
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,250
humidity is and they will get a little

834
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,680
bit thicker where it lacks humidity

835
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,289
because those leaves are trying to catch

836
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,880
humidity in a dry area they will get

837
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,339
bigger because they're trying to find

838
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,810
more surface to catch more moisture in a

839
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:58,159
humid area they're gonna get smaller

840
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:00,230
because they're getting plenty of

841
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,029
moisture that's why you see sativa

842
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,039
plants that are grown in tropical areas

843
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,869
have those skinny leaves I think that's

844
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:08,359
why indica plants have those big wide

845
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:10,039
fat leaves part of their purpose is to

846
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,409
gather moisture from the air they're

847
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,940
looking for humidity so you what you may

848
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:18,680
see you may see that difference in

849
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,809
Florida now if you take a clone of that

850
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,100
plant before it flowers and you keep it

851
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,019
and you drive it to Colorado and you

852
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:26,029
give it back to me and I grow that out I

853
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,859
will probably see the change even if

854
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,839
it's several years even if it's the same

855
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,399
season I'll probably see a little bit of

856
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,619
a difference because these plants are

857
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,750
such quick adaptors they're little

858
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:38,809
soldiers they will adapt in one season

859
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,970
this plant is only expected to live one

860
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,859
year it's supposed to happen

861
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,809
in the spring it's supposed to pop up

862
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:46,519
it's supposed to veg through the spring

863
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,809
by the time fall comes it's supposed to

864
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,220
be flowering and when the winter hits

865
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:50,629
it's supposed to be gone it's supposed

866
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,549
to have dropped seeds in the ground so

867
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,590
that it can do it again so it only gets

868
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:57,200
a year and these plants adapt very

869
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:58,909
quickly so I wanna get myself back on

870
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,120
track here and the email you ask does

871
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,400
this mean that plants have unlimited

872
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:05,659
phenotypes that kind of [ __ ] with my

873
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,460
head because I didn't know the answer I

874
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,380
was like well they're kind of because

875
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,029
it's based on environment but then I

876
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,220
thought I should Google the word

877
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:15,230
phenotype to give myself a more clear

878
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,839
idea of what I'm talking about and the

879
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,789
actual definition from Google this is

880
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,429
where I found it is Google it says the

881
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:24,500
set of observable characteristics of an

882
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,049
individual resulting from the

883
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,659
interaction of its genotype with the

884
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,819
environment

885
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,200
that brought me to this conclusion and I

886
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:33,819
actually recorded two or three other

887
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,669
pieces and I had to back up and delete

888
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:39,700
it no there are not unlimited phenotypes

889
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:41,320
there are unlimited environment and that

890
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,509
phenotype will express itself

891
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,999
differently in different environments

892
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,399
and that took me a lot of rambling to

893
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:50,889
get to so I hope that makes sense that's

894
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,569
why doing a phyno hunt for yourself with

895
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:55,298
a pack of seeds is so important because

896
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:57,668
you'll find the phenotype it grows in

897
00:30:55,298 --> 00:30:59,019
your grow environment that works the

898
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,659
best for you and i'm going to do an

899
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,009
episode pretty soon about expectations

900
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,019
from a seed pack because i've been

901
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:08,200
talking to a few people about seeds and

902
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:10,089
seed sales and there is definitely a

903
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,379
podcast due for that alright i want to

904
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:14,019
get back into the email so we can wrap

905
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:18,278
this up yes another question in here he

906
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:20,288
says I always thought that a Fino was if

907
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:21,729
you pop ten beans and all ten pop that

908
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:23,200
each one will express themselves a

909
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:25,869
little differently showing it to be a

910
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,269
specific phenotype let's like let's say

911
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:30,428
Gorilla Glue for for instance let's say

912
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:33,069
you have it and it's available in seed

913
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:35,229
can I pop a ten pack and find that

914
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:37,450
gorilla glue number four or is that a

915
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:40,359
Fino based on some guy's environment and

916
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,220
if so what a Colorado gorilla glue for

917
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:44,228
be the same if you gave it to me here in

918
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,868
Florida and then he says you get me and

919
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:48,669
then he ends with sorry bro once again

920
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:50,798
for the confusion and long message much

921
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,710
love bro thanks again you can respond

922
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,839
via email or show all is good Oh bro

923
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,950
Here I am responding on the show and I'm

924
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,439
gonna answer the last part of that

925
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,210
question for you if you did get a ten

926
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,970
pack of seeds and the breeding was done

927
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:07,210
properly yes you should be able to find

928
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,608
a very similar phenotype to what the

929
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,858
breeder has labeled as the gorilla glue

930
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:13,478
number four that's probably not gonna

931
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:15,009
happen with gorilla glue for because it

932
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:17,649
was accidentally bred it wasn't done on

933
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:19,598
purpose but let's talk about a strain

934
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:21,848
that I've bred that I can talk about

935
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:24,999
that I know what happens Firefly Firefly

936
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:28,960
is a strain that I made Firefly is lemon

937
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:30,669
skunk to arise Firefly has got three you

938
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,098
know honestly most strains are gonna

939
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,710
show approximately three to five basic

940
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:38,138
phenotypes and the f1 through F - maybe

941
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,669
f3 generations you're going to get one

942
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:41,648
that looks like the mommy you're gonna

943
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:42,860
get one that looks like the daddy you're

944
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:44,329
gonna find a few notes

945
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:46,519
that is right in the middle of those

946
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,778
that shows both parents equally then

947
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,250
you're gonna get one that's [ __ ] up

948
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:51,589
and then you're gonna get one that's

949
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,000
kind of like amazing and stellar it's

950
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:54,439
either gonna taste really good or it's

951
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,769
gonna have a lot of resin it's gonna be

952
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,150
something stand out usually you'll find

953
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,798
the one of those that you want and

954
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,538
you'll breed to it again and then you're

955
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,369
gonna get two or three phenotypes you're

956
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:06,200
gonna get one that looks like mommy one

957
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:07,908
that looks like Daddy and one that's the

958
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,890
perfect cross of the - and if you keep

959
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:11,870
breeding you can narrow it down to where

960
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,309
they all come out as the perfect mix or

961
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,028
they all look like mommy or they all

962
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:16,339
look like daddy

963
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:18,950
my goal is usually to make that perfect

964
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,629
mix I usually see traits in a male plant

965
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,159
and I see traits in a female plant and I

966
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,809
think hey if I put those two traits

967
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,610
together I can make one bad [ __ ]

968
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:28,398
and that's usually what inspires my

969
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:30,829
breeding so what I'm getting at is you

970
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,989
should be able to find if you crack a

971
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:34,788
pack of my Firefly you should be able to

972
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,490
find the phenotype that I have been

973
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:39,500
posting pictures of Firefly has three

974
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,870
very distinct phenotypes that I can

975
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,089
identify early and flower and if you

976
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,889
cracked a pack of ten seeds and you

977
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:48,589
flowered them by the end of flower you

978
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,450
will find one that looks just like the

979
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:53,509
Firefly I have been posting pictures of

980
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,580
and since Firefly is not a clone only

981
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:57,470
Gorilla Glue for his clone only he

982
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:59,538
called it Gorilla Glue 4 I assumed he

983
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,089
had an amount of seeds there were at

984
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,980
least four maybe he had 10 seeds and

985
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,599
Gorilla Glue 4 was the one that stick

986
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,130
around stuck around because it was good

987
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,889
he probably got rid of all the others

988
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,099
and it was probably labeled Gorilla Glue

989
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,869
number 4 on a clone or on a bag and that

990
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,980
just stuck forever it didn't lose the 4

991
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:17,419
it was just guerrilla glue there's also

992
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,070
number 7 now that I think about it so

993
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:20,329
there had to be at least 7 I'm guessing

994
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,119
there were probably 10 or 15 that he

995
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,179
cracked you know so gorilla glue number

996
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,379
4 and gorilla glue number 7 were the two

997
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,639
desirable phenotypes that he found I

998
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:30,529
don't know what the differences are

999
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,320
I've only grown the number 4 it was fun

1000
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,839
to grow it drew huge chunky ass buds but

1001
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,940
once again getting rambly so yes if you

1002
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,039
do crack a 10 pack you should be able to

1003
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,690
find something if the seeds were bred

1004
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,690
properly even if your grow rooms a

1005
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,220
little bit different ah hopefully your

1006
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,869
grow room is within a certain

1007
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,178
temperature range hopefully you've got a

1008
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,338
certain humidity range hopefully you're

1009
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,929
running a certain amount of light that's

1010
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:56,239
what's keeping us all uniform all the

1011
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,920
growers are hopefully within

1012
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,339
those certain parameters so the plants

1013
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,470
are gonna show basically the same

1014
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,840
phenotype achill expressions indoors if

1015
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:07,699
you're running appropriate environments

1016
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,200
outdoors you may see some things

1017
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:11,269
differently but outdoors is a whole new

1018
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,559
ballgame if you're doing a Fino hunt and

1019
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,360
if you're looking for things like that

1020
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,519
that's probably happening indoors do

1021
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,829
your Fino hunt indoors find the keeper

1022
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,840
run that keeper outdoors that's how I

1023
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:22,969
would do it so I guess that was the long

1024
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,820
way of saying since we're all are all

1025
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:27,319
running very similar grill rooms yes you

1026
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,160
should be able to find something very

1027
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,740
similar to the known the gorilla glue

1028
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,618
number four or what I'm calling the bud

1029
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:38,179
in the picture phenotype but if all

1030
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,559
you've got to go by as a picture how do

1031
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,868
you know if you're actually getting one

1032
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,049
that smells taste smokes has the potency

1033
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:47,240
and is actually the representation of

1034
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,320
whatever string drill a glue fire fly

1035
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,269
how do you know it's the one that you

1036
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,340
want what I recommend is growing out a

1037
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:54,380
pack of seeds and finding the one that

1038
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,240
grows best in your environment smokes

1039
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,280
best for you works best

1040
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,139
medically if it's a medical product

1041
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,030
works best recreationally if it's a

1042
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:04,129
recreational product find the one that's

1043
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,180
ideal for you that's what a Fino hunts

1044
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,619
all about if you're trying to get

1045
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,329
something that's known like that try to

1046
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:11,059
get the clone there are plenty of ways

1047
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:12,108
to get clone only strains but one thing

1048
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:14,059
I've noticed about a lot of these

1049
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:15,559
strains is they're all hype that lasts

1050
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:17,960
for just a little while until the next

1051
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,820
type strain comes out for a minute there

1052
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,829
it was the Girl Scout cookies and then

1053
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,380
it was the gorilla glue and then it was

1054
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:26,299
tangi and then it was some sherbert and

1055
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,890
who knows what its gonna be next week

1056
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,900
but it just changes it was skittles for

1057
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,368
a minute so don't worry too much about a

1058
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,470
hype strain don't worry too much about

1059
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,880
what you read get a good pack of seeds

1060
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:36,500
if that's what you need to do and run

1061
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,108
them and find the phenotype that works

1062
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,519
best for you alright I hope I was able

1063
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:42,469
