119
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,299
YouTube you guys all of the YouTube

120
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,250
videos are caught up I did it it took a

121
00:03:53,299 --> 00:04:00,040
long time but they are finally there

122
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,310
that was a multi-year project I do

123
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,379
YouTube got evil right before right at

124
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,610
the scariest time yeah I was just about

125
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,840
caught up and then all of the YouTube

126
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,450
channels started disappearing

127
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,960
I don't put videos on myself consuming

128
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,639
on this channel on that so yeah I talked

129
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,019
heavily about it but they don't see it

130
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,810
so unless they're looking for it and

131
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,340
someone reports it we should be okay

132
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,990
we'll see how long it lasts either way

133
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,229
if it does disappear I'll find any place

134
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,610
to put it don't worry um YouTube is up

135
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,050
that's just to play some more people to

136
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,730
listen to the show I think we'll

137
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,879

138
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,050

146
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,060
of people were talking on Instagram live

147
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,250
and on chat rooms right now about how to

148
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,839
decide when to harvest their cannabis

149
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,980
when is my cannabis ripe the seed packs

150
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,889
are gonna tell you a certain timeframe

151
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,750
they're gonna say 56 to 63 days they're

152
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:08,680
gonna say 63 to 70 days they're gonna

153
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,560
say 9 to 10 weeks the first time you run

154
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,840
that pack of seeds I would say go the

155
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,449
longest time frame that they give you as

156
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,909
an option at least plan for for sure yes

157
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,490
yeah if it says 10 wheat 9 to 10 weeks

158
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,169

go 10 weeks if it says 10 weeks if it

166
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,919
says 56 to 63 days let it go 63 I'll let

167
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,400
it go 65 if it looks ok and see what

168
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,000
happens

169
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,399
ah so that being said the way to

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,750
determine ripeness of your cannabis

171
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:57,789
plants is not by looking at the hairs

172
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,709
it is not by looking at it's not by

173
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,410
looking at I did air quotes when I said

174
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:05,628
I'm just I'm hearing different people

175
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:10,199
throughout my cannabis career

176
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:12,539
right like speaking at length about how

177
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,658
all of those are telltale signs of like

178
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,848
either perfect or good or completed or

179
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:20,519
operating a harvester and it's all

180
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:22,288
nonsense yeah what we are growing

181
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,228
cannabis for the viable part that we

182
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:27,449
want are the trichomes why would we look

183
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,128
at anything but the trichomes right we

184
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,990
want to harvest those when they're at

185
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,479
their brightest point so we should be

186
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,370
paying attention to the trichomes the

187
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,990
only way you can do that you can if

188
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,750
somebody tells you they can see the

189
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,030
trichomes with their naked eye either

190
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,620
steal their eyes or kick them in the

191
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,258
dick because they're a liar you cannot

192
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,780
see amber trichomes without some sort of

193
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,419
magnification you need at least 60 X

194
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,239
maybe a hundred X magnification to see

195
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:57,899
if a trichome is clear cloudy silver

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,180
milky amber busted ruptured if the heads

197
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,948
broken off of it you need magnification

198
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,288
you cannot see that with the naked eye

199
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,250
and if you can you're [ __ ] awesome

200
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:09,418
send me a message I want to hear about

201
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,459
it yep good get on Amazon start looking

202
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,209
the scopes folks yeah get yourself like

203
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,459
a jeweler's loupe

204
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,379
I have a scope from Dino light that

205
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,500
hooks up to my computer I plug it right

206
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,750
into the USB slot it took me just a few

207
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,848
minutes to mess with the drivers to make

208
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,158
it link up to my computer once it linked

209
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:28,288
up it was no problem ever I open up the

210
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:30,810
application I'm able to run the scope

211
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:33,689
over the plants and I can focus it in

212
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,668
and I can see those trichomes very large

213
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,649
on my computer screen and it makes it

214
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,149
very and I can take pictures so if I

215
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,649
can't tell exactly what I'm looking at I

216
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:43,348
can reach over and I think I press f11

217
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,120
and I take a photo right there boom yep

218
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,680
then I can go look later and I can see

219
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,629
if that plants ripe or not the the

220
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,879
computerized scope makes life a lot

221
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,718
easier but you can pick up some kind of

222
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,089
like a jeweler's loupe

223
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:56,579
it's a lot less expensive and just as

224
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,049
functional the 420 scope will work for

225
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,848
you just a basic jeweler's loupe

226
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,728
will work for you there's one that

227
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:04,348
Hydrofarm sells it spreads in half it's

228
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:05,818
got batteries in it then it splits in

229
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:07,110
half and the batteries are in one side

230
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,259
and the optics are actually on the other

231
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,020
side they make a 60 and a 100x I would

232
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,939
recommend 100x if you go for that that's

233
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,709
probably the best one on the market if

234
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,028
you're gonna get something like that but

235
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,138
I'm aware of there's probably something

236
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:22,050
better by now

237
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,210
but get some magnification magnification

238
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,829
will help you out in so many ways you'll

239
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,329
be able to tell if your trichomes are

240
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,008
clear if they're silver if they're

241
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:31,139
cloudy if they're milky if they're amber

242
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,360
if they're ruptured also you'll be able

243
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,950
to identify the pests and the funguses

244
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,930
and the problems on the undersides of

245
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,879
your leaves more accurately if you've

246
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,158
got a scope to look at those there's a

247
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,929
really useful tool throughout the growth

248
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,819
cycle for sure yeah once you've got all

249
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,799
of your tools dialed in and you've got

250
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,750
some money to spend on a couple extra

251
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,819
toys for the grow room get yourself a

252
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,320
scope it will really help a scope or a

253
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,740
loop or something that hooks up to your

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,050
computer all right so the hairs are not

255
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,310
gonna tell you how ready your plant is

256
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:01,319

261
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,360
scratching behind his ear you guys

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,860
switchin tell you if your cannabis

263
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
plants are ripe are the trichomes we're

264
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,889
drawing for trichomes that's what we

265
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,539
want if you're growing to make quality

266
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,708
flowers if you're gonna make edibles if

267
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,000
you're gonna make extracts if you're

268
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,889
gonna make anything the trichomes are

269
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,519
what matter so pay attention to that

270
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:28,679
nothing else now the way that you can

271
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,419
tell the trichomes you're gonna see the

272
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,500
trichomes develop on your plant if you

273
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,110
have a scope and you can pay attention

274
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,879
through the entire process do that watch

275
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,949
those trichomes go from a little bitty

276
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,769
stalk watch them develop a head

277
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:43,409
watch the head of that trichome fill up

278
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,419
you'll watch it fill up it'll get juicy

279
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:47,610
and then it'll start to change colors

280
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,789
it'll go from clear then it'll slowly

281
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,720
turn to like a silver ish color then

282
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,849
it'll get cloudy

283
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,440
you'll be once you see it you'll know

284
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,839
right now you're going what does he mean

285
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,399
by cloudy you've got to imagine if you

286
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,500
got a fishbowl and then you put some

287
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,389
dish soap in there and stirred it up

288
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,339
it's cloudy that's what your cloudy

289
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,860
trichomes are gonna look like that's

290
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,920
cloudy now your next step after cloudy

291
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,050
is milky sometimes they turn kind of

292
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,139
bluish in my opinion they have a hint of

293
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,088
blue they have that if you stir it like

294
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,980
certain white paints and whatnot you'll

295
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,140
start to see a blue kind of undertone a

296
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,139
little bit yeah yeah and it's yeah a

297
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,360
nice patch of milky trichomes I always

298
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,948
see just a little hint of light blue in

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,568
there so the fishbowl I talked about a

300
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:32,909
minute ago imagine if I took your

301
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:34,139
fishbowl that had we dumped out the dish

302
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:36,179
because this is just gonna get gross if

303
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,769
we keep adding stuff I'm gross let's do

304
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,629
this differently imagine if you took a

305
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,210
fishbowl that's got water in it and you

306
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,480
poured just enough milk in there to make

307
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,700
it turn light white light white not it's

308
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,409
not gonna be [ __ ] boom like ice cream

309
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,790
but it's gonna be light white like you

310
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,709
poured some creamer in your coffee you

311
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,389
just lighten it up you can see it now

312
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,389
now that trichome is what I would call

313
00:10:54,389 --> 00:11:00,419
milky that is a milky trichome you're

314
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:02,519
almost ready for harvest the next step

315
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,620
that's gonna happen is gonna look like

316
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,179
you had a spray bottle imagine if I took

317
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,470
like the little spray bottle that you're

318
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,959
spraying your plants with or whatever

319
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,940
you get little mister bottle what if I

320
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,530
poured some dr. pepper in there and I

321
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,650
walked right up to your trichomes

322
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:19,860
and just just give it a little spritz

323
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:22,289
and dr. pepper your trichomes are gonna

324
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,480
have a little amber spritz on them now

325
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:25,829
and that's exactly what I think it looks

326
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,009
like it's like you sprayed some soda

327
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,810
right onto your trichomes they're gonna

328
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,269
go from milky and then you're gonna see

329
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:35,819
just a couple of them get this amber

330
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,559
color this dr. pepper color right across

331
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,360
them and you're gonna see it happen

332
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,549
toward the top and kind of right in the

333
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,509
middle and then keep pay attention to

334
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:45,359
the whole planck's it's gonna move

335
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:47,309
around but when you see that first bit

336
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,960
of amber really start paying attention

337
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:51,119
because you've got a very short time now

338
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,530
they're gonna start that amber is gonna

339
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,409
start progressing throughout the plant

340
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:58,799
really quickly and when you look at the

341
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:00,959
scope and you can see you're gonna have

342
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,000
to look around the plant when 30% of

343
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,050
those trichomes start becoming amber

344
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,509
that's when you want to cut down 30%

345
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:11,129
yeah I say look in several places you're

346
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,779
gonna be like 30% how do I know and I

347
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,460
can see a hundred trichomes in there

348
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:18,839
just look around and use your best

349
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,580
judgment you guys about 25 to 35% is

350
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,200
where you want to aim for you're not

351
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,270
gonna notice a difference if you're a

352
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,009
few days off on your harvest honestly

353
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,629
you are not going to notice a huge

354
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:29,970
difference you've got a dry and cure

355
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,250
period once you cut down these plants

356
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,350
those trichomes are going to continue to

357
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,360
change all the way until the moment you

358
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,580
combust them you're gonna cut them down

359
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,379
you've got this dry period they're gonna

360
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,720
get beat up and harvest they're gonna

361
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,519
get cured they're gonna change there's

362
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,440
going to be so many different changes in

363
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,120
those trichomes so just a couple of

364
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,980
days in your harvest window will not

365
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
make a huge difference you're not gonna

366
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,570
notice it it's not gonna hurt your

367
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,700
feelings so pay attention to those try

368
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,980
comps get yourself a scope they're gonna

369
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,080
go clear then they're gonna turn silver

370
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,519
then they're gonna get cloudy that's

371
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,050
when it starts getting excited their

372
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,840
filter that's getting exciting they're

373
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,529
filling up with trichomes are with uh

374
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,240
cannabinoids now they've got different

375
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,559
things in their different psychoactive

376
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,019
ingredients inside of there that are

377
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,369
changing every day then they're gonna

378
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,439
get milky they're gonna turn a little

379
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,789
bit blue then they're gonna look like I

380
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,730
sprayed them with dr. pepper

381
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:22,829
when three out of ten went 30% of them

382
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,029
have that dr. pepper stain on them

383
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:29,100
that's when it's time to cut so you're

384
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:32,309
gonna say but it's my first grow with

385
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,920
this plant how do I plan that how do I

386
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,559
properly be able to flush and look out

387
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,229
for trichomes to be amber I thought of a

388
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,319
great way that we can all be safe you

389
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,519
keep in mind this isn't gonna be the

390
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,870
last time you're growing the strain

391
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,159
hopefully this is the first time you

392
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,450
grew it that's why you don't know when

393
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,589
the trichomes are gonna change colors

394
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,879
that's why you don't know how long it's

395
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,350
gonna take it's the first time you're

396
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,509
developing a relationship with this

397
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,460
plant the first time you got to learn it

398
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,809
the second third time you dial it in the

399
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,759
fourth and fifth time you [ __ ]

400
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,979
perfect this grow yeah so you're just

401
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,899
learning this one so keep thinking about

402
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,990
it this way if you're growing a

403
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:10,289
sixty-day plant if the package says grow

404
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,789
it for 55 to 60 days go that 60 days if

405
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,159
you're gonna go for 60 days

406
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:16,199
flush it day 50 and really start paying

407
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,789
attention to those trichomes if you want

408
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,710
to cut it down at a specific day just

409
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:23,189
make sure you flushed 7 to 10 days

410
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,900
pretty heavily I'd like to go 14 but 7

411
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,870
to 10 days should be plenty

412
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,490
if you want to let your plant go 70 days

413
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,799
if you've got something I bred you

414
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,409
probably want to let it go 70 days if I

415
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,599
bred it 70 days no problem start

416
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,519
flushing at day 60 and pay attention to

417
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,529
your trichomes you can cut down at day

418
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,939
70 if you don't feel like it's ready let

419
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,649
it go a little bit longer it doesn't

420
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,330
need nutrients to keep going it's just

421
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,389
gonna start getting tired but then you

422
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,360
can give it time to ripen up so I think

423
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:54,449
the way to judge when to harvest your

424
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,980
cannabis is by paying attention to the

425
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,629
trichomes if you don't have a way to

426
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,750
look at the trichomes you don't have a

427
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,669
way to accurately judge the ripe

428
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,529
this of your cannabis plants and you run

429
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,509
the risk of cutting them way too early

430
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,579
is what most people do if you feel like

431
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,319
they're done wait three to five more

432
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,360
days if you can wait seven more days

433
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,310
wait because they're only gonna get

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,009
better and don't cut too early because

435
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:18,439
you're anxious and eager

436
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,600
patience patience you cut clones or you

437
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,070
grew from seeds and those took time then

438
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,930
you've edged it out you spent a lot of

439
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,760
money on nutrients you've already spent

440
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:28,609
you're probably gonna put a hundred and

441
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,679
fifteen days into it why not put 120 -

442
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,090
what's another week right I know you

443
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,889
start getting itchy you start getting

444
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,120
that the crackhead lips and he starts

445
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,649
scratching your neck you're like yeah I

446
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,850
want to cut it down I'm thinking of a

447
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,309
friend of mine who was always in that

448
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,139
clip in lower nut he'd start at the

449
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:44,709
bottom of the plants are taking nugs and

450
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm drying him out as fast as he could

451
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,310
to keep himself covered and by the time

452
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,960
we got the harvest it was just like the

453
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:52,879
top coal is left on the plant

454
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,400
yeah and then there's nothing to enjoy

455
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,320
because you fast ride everything and you

456
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,840
could have just had one huge harvest and

457
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,160
actually saw his dough you can see what

458
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,230
it looks like what your work actually

459
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,750
did instead of just destroying your work

460
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,550
slowly not getting any reward yeah so be

461
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,289
patient you guys that's that's one of

462
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,059
the main things that it's hard to learn

463
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:13,219
when you're growing cannabis sometimes

464
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:15,588
you just need to hide your scissors send

465
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,420
Mike home with the scissors but I can't

466
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:23,330
cut my plants up you're like oh you're

467
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:24,620
on suicide watch or something so I guess

468
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,180
that was a pretty quick way to do it but

469
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,399
I mean that's right to the point there's

470
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:29,689
no other way to explain that I'd get a

471
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
jeweler's loupe get some sort of

472
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,950
magnification and look at your trichomes

473
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,939
I know I keep saying it we're growing

474
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:40,129
for trichomes we you just got to get in

475
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,410
there with some magnification and spend

476
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,519
some time reading the plan yeah we don't

477
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,350
we're not worried about all the green

478
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,579
leafy part I mean that part tastes good

479
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,350
that's fun to smoke that's a cool

480
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,660
carrier but the trichomes are the goal

481
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,180
so make sure they're ripe something that

482
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:56,659
I should add if you are growing for

483
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:59,029
concentrates maybe cut a little bit

484
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:01,610
early start flushing early and harvest a

485
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,169
little bit early because once the if you

486
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,939
want nice and clear concentrates maybe

487
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,930
this is some industry secrets secrets I

488
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,670
shouldn't be sharing with the general

489
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,709
public but here you go guys I love you

490
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,300
and this is free if you want nice and

491
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,380
clear concentrates cut your plants down

492
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,680
before the trichomes start

493
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,910
getting dark if they start getting dark

494
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,459
what you are extracting is trichomes

495
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,990
your concentrates will come out a little

496
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,880
bit darker cut them down when they're

497
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,920
nice and clear and guess what nice and

498
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,240
clear concentrates it's easier a lot of

499
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,560
a lot of concentrate makers can make

500
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,720
super clear concentrates out of

501
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,460
everything now but it's easier it's less

502
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,529
to clean up it's less work if you're

503
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,059
pulling it down when you have got nice

504
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,279
and clear try comes out early and

505
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,269
process quickly yep they cut them down I

506
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,789
don't even want to tell you what week

507
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,740
sometimes like running big sevenish I've

508
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,089
seen it go there concentrates yeah a

509
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,250
little bit ridiculous but then you can

510
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,539
pull a whole one more harvest a year if

511
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,130
you cut everything down at the end of

512
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,490
week six but you could feel one more

513
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,110
harvest a year in your schedule that's

514
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,019
business unfortunately you guys do not

515
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,629
do that be patient let it go long enough

516
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:05,099
let it be done like Axl Rose said all we

517
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,810
need is just a little patience Mike just

518
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,609

519
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:09,690
guys hey Mike do you got any political

520
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:17,399
stuff you want to talk about for a

521
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:20,420
minute some there's always some good

522
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,130
news this week for medical cannabis

523
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:26,190
consumers or patients whichever you

524
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,250
prefer down in Florida a judge down

525
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,170
there ruled that they can finally

526
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,869
consume their cannabis products by

527
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,000
combustion and inhalation they made

528
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:38,069
smoking marijuana legal finally for

529
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,660
medical patients down there up until

530
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:43,049
recently they were sort of insisting

531
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,940
that people use non smokeable or

532
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,220
favorable forms so they were only able

533
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,370
to use teachers topicals

534
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,350
capsules and edibles and edibles well

535
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:54,509
that's okay edibles oils to choose

536
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,539
alright I mean it's it's quite a variety

537
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:59,549
of products and in florida's really just

538
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,359
getting off the ground but can they dab

539
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:05,250
concentrates now I'm actually I'm this

540
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,899
has this literally just happened the

541
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,609
small okay so no but they can at least

542
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,230
smoke a bowl now they can smoke a joint

543
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:11,609
which is why a lot of us choose cannabis

544
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,620
because it's that's how it's you

545
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,329
immediately effective you can get an

546
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,759
immediate effect and you can titrate

547
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:20,549
your dose perfectly perfectly like the

548
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,740
first time out the door no but by the

549
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,599
time you're like successfully treating a

550
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,390
pain disorder or something like that

551
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,969
like I can consume exact

552
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,220
to the point of no pain right and that

553
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,110
if I choose to consume further into the

554
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,970
points of enjoyment I can choose to do

555
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:36,949
that or stop I know about where my

556
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,319
medical needs are I know about how many

557
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,819
dabs it takes for me to meet my medical

558
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,889
requirements and then I know about when

559
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:44,389
I started going recreational I know

560
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,160
where that line is and then I know how

561
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,780
to sustain that medical and I also know

562
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,940
how to cross that line whenever I need

563
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:50,990
to so yeah we should be allowed to well

564
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,509
I'm glad that Florida is allowed to

565
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,670
consume properly now for a while that

566
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:57,079
was just a federal patient or two down

567
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,930

576
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,529
holder for most joints consumed per

577
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,680

578
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:23,690
stockbroker in Florida but you should

579
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,470
speaking of a lot of joints smoked happy

580
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:34,039

581
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:35,150
this weekend yes James oldest [ __ ] so

582
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,470
shout out to our friends down there in

583
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,780
Florida finally able to do it right

584
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,940
welcome to the club Florida how many of

585
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,519
those retired folk down there in Florida

586
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,710
are the cannabis consumers is that part

587
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,160
of who's consuming do you think oh for

588
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,960
sure for sure one of the the fun little

589
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,090
data points out of Colorado is our

590
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,329
medical program the average age is 42

591
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:59,389
not and that was when you and me were in

592
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:00,769
our 20s and early 30s in it and it was

593
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,570
still well into the 40s and that's

594
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,420
because boomers are a huge cannabis

595
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:07,039
consuming population they it's a

596
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,640
population with a lot of aches and pains

597
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,889
and if they can treat those in a way

598
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,100
that doesn't song come out and they can

599
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,540
enjoy those years substantially more

600
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,399
because they choose to use cannabis

601
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,170
instead of opioids for their pain or

602
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,780
trying to choose with just dealing with

603
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,250
their pain like they dive right on at

604
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:28,039
the top of those the edibles they love

605
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,170
at all I think it's a great social

606
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,589
lubricant and a great alternative to

607
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,080
alcohol I cannot I cannot manage alcohol

608
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,359
and so when I once I start drinking were

609
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,069
just gonna drink and it's not gonna be a

610
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,469
pretty ending like that's just how

611
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:44,239
my alcohol consumption goes I cannot do

612
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,819
to myself with dabs and cannabis what

613
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:48,829
I'm able to do to myself with alcohol so

614
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,868
I think just a couple of you know you

615
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,608
just smoke with people you just pass

616
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:54,349
around a pipe it creates that when you

617
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:55,908
pass around a pipe together you just

618
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,648
created friendship you know hey I hit

619
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,179
this you hit this we both consume the

620
00:21:57,648 --> 00:22:00,888
same thing let's be friends now

621
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,528
I think it's just becoming more of an

622
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:07,099
acceptable social lubricant as well it's

623
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:08,960
not so taboo more people are willing to

624
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:10,608
admit that they consume cannabis which

625
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,278
is kind of nice a lot of people used to

626
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:15,829
only smoke behind closed doors it's fun

627
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:19,489
watching everybody come out of the

628
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:22,939
woodwork for sure it's uh it was lonely

629
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:24,139
for a while in the 90s like I remember

630
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,499
times where I was like you change

631
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:29,238
location and you'd spend months like

632
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:31,579
meeting new people and then figuring out

633
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:34,278
like who you should ask about cannabis

634
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:36,499
and how you should ask it I mean there

635
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,858
was a time before hey bro do you smoke

636
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:43,460
and then the reply of smoke was what bro

637
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:45,618
like that wasn't always a thing you used

638
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,108
to have to be like hey I noticed that

639
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:50,569
you have a Jeep Cherokee with a fish

640
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:52,158
sticker on it yeah yeah I walked in with

641
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:57,829
[ __ ] long ass hair and a Grateful

642
00:22:52,159 --> 00:23:00,528
Dead shirt everything - want to go ski

643
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:02,689
maryjane together after class later like

644
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:05,210
it used to be [ __ ] complicated yeah

645
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,470
and now everybody's coming out of the

646
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,619
woodwork it's one of the things I really

647
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:12,108
liked about being a budtender is to all

648

up in any way shape or form it's not

653
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:26,720

still but so that's just about every

665
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:53,490
walk of life is able to walk in there

666
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,599
you got

667
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,329
dudes that work in the industry

668
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,439

670
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,549
accountants car salesmen everybody was

671
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,890
coming in there yeah I mean you'll have

672
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,649
a $200,000 car next to a VW bus in the

673
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,300
parking lot and it makes for a good

674
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,100
photo for Facebook but other than that

675
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,109
it's just your regular workday you know

676
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,719
what I find is the guy that drives the

677
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:21,928
Volkswagen bus buys the more expensive

678
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,690
product than the guy that drives the via

679
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:30,660
the Beemer or whatever the other example

680
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:32,789
was the Mercedes the the the more you're

681
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,230
into the cannabis community and

682
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,049
lifestyle the more you care about

683
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,370
quality I think yes exactly you get a

684
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,928
lot of people that are like it all

685
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:45,269
smells the same to me and you just want

686
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:48,360
to smack them but like it all smells the

687
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,308
[ __ ] same what I get the same with

688
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,279
like seafood I know people that love

689
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:55,529
seafood and there's big intricacies

690
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,879
between like this particular product in

691
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,200
that particular project all [ __ ] it

692
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,940
smells like death to me I can't get

693
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,380
anywhere near it

694
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,240
and so like I get it some people just

695
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,210
don't have the palate to distinguish

696
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,009
cannabis varieties but man for those of

697
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,289
us our kin it's a wonderful world and

698
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,879
the more you get into the world the more

699
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,980
you care about quality the more you're

700
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,540
willing to dig into it a lot of people

701
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,700
like I don't care give me the strongest

702
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,079
yeah I went to a dispensary a new place

703
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,360
the other day that I'd never shopped in

704
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,500
before just because I went to weed maps

705
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,240
and they said they had a product I

706
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,920
wanted and so I already knew what I was

707
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,058
shopping for the minute I walked in and

708
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,470
I walk in and they're like hey welcome

717
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,789
dog black label and she's like we're

718
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,099
here the concentrates here's our

719
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:49,500
clothing and I was like no I want and

720
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,029
I'm like just get it yeah it took me so

721
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,380
many tries just to convince this lady I

722
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,730
know what I want and then when she

723
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,320
showed it to me she goes well this is

724
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,429
and she told me how much it was a little

725
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,500
pricey I don't know if I should say how

726
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,509
much stuff costs on the air but she said

727
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,980
a number and that's that's not you know

728
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:03,509
that's not cheap but I was like yeah I

729
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,940
want that one and I want one of these

730
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:08,099
also and she's like those are this much

731
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,830
yeah I want it and she acted like oh

732
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,569
okay and then is this a place on the

733
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:15,898
south side of town yeah I told you where

734
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:18,028
I went yeah typical I mean

735
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:19,798
my guess is that part of town they get a

736
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:21,359
clientele looking for a different price

737
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:22,470
point right yeah and so they were kind

738
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,849
of shocked when I asked for that

739
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,319
top-shelf stuff but they wouldn't just

740
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,638
walk me I was like I want high-end

741
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,230
concentrate that she wouldn't just show

742
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:31,829
me that and then they do this weird

743
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,269
thing most dispensaries you say yeah

744
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:35,009
I'll take that thing right and then

745
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:36,808
either that budtender walks it to the

746
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,128
cash register and rings you up for it

747
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:40,048
and takes your money until is you have a

748
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:42,089
great day and high-fives you right they

749
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:43,918
go okay and they push some buttons on an

750
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,658
iPad and she just kind of walked away

751
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,399
from me and I was like well know what

752
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,360
[ __ ] and she came back she was oh

753
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,798
they'll call your name when they're

754
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,538
ready for you sweetie walk around and

755
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:53,009
look around and I was like well okay so

756
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,329
I just walk around for a couple of

757
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:55,740
minutes aimlessly didn't really want to

758
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,119
see anything I've already purchased I've

759
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,339
already selected why do I want to go

760
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,018
Walker I'm done now yeah I don't take

761
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,939
money let me go home maybe somewhere

762
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,710
comfortable to play and so this point

763
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,600
they took a few minutes and then they

764
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,940
called my full name over the counter

765
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,189
over the PA which I don't know if that

766
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,259
was cool like isn't there should be some

767
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,690
discretion here like I just know I'd be

768
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,190
as well yeah like the people call me

769
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,720
something different here so I was like

770
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,120
oh I'm gonna walk over and be that name

771
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,470
and so then they they take your money

772
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,048
and they show you exactly what you

773
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,750

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,350
cannabis industry kind of expands

824
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:05,589
contracts people try different sticks

825
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:08,799
and like the iPad or the Apple store

826
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:11,169
model frustrates the [ __ ] out it feels

827
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,839
weird like let me smell these three jars

828
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,820
and I'll buy someone I'm on a roll like

829
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,829
how it doesn't need to take all

830
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:19,599
afternoon I've got other [ __ ] to do I've

831
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,769
got three more stops to make before I go

832
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,029
home and when I get home there's new we

833
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:24,160
screaming kids like I don't have time

834
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,960
for your speech that's why there are so

835
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,009
many though yeah and that leads me to

836
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,180
something else that I should have been

837
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,920
saying on the podcast that I haven't

838
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,860
ever said before you guys if you're

839
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,750
going to a dispensary and the quality is

840
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:36,819
okay go to a different one next week and

841
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,049
see if the quality is awesome

842
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:39,189
because there are dispensaries with

843
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,569
better quality than where you're

844
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,820
shopping you don't have to go somewhere

845
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:45,849
just because it's the one on the way

846
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:48,339
home if you go to the dispensaries with

847
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,559
the quality products the one the

848
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:52,389
dispensary without quality products will

849
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,639
either disappear or they'll step up

850
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,009
their game and then we won't have this

851
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,500
problem of all this mediocre [ __ ]

852

862
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,409
reason for you to be like what's the

863
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,940
cheapest thing in the store yeah I need

864
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,009
to spend eight bucks just cuz you spent

865
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,900
six minutes with me so me this pack of

866
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:31,660
papers I'll take the pack of papers yeah

867
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,620
like just no good god only differently

868
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,370
store they have paper

869
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:38,339
- feelings there are a lot of different

870
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:40,029
vibes there are a lot of different

871
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,339
processes the way that things are

872
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:45,129
handled is election product selection

873
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:46,990
yeah carries wild so wildly pricing will

874
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,700
be it'll see the same products on the

875
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,380
shelf for twenty that you'll see four

876
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,630
forty five on another place but then

877
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,600
they'll have the a rivaling product that

878
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,030
prices will be switched like viola is

879
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,439
twenty at one place and CSC is forty at

880
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:02,049
that place and then if I drive across

881
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,880
town the viola is forty in the CSC is

882
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:05,500
twenty and it's just [ __ ] how they

883
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,179
priced them for some reason there's

884
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,880
places in town that only carry one

885
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:11,530
concentrate line and then the

886
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,929
concentrate line they carry you can't

887
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:15,789
get in any other shop right there's a

888
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,320
lot of that and it takes kind of going

889
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:19,569
around to all the different shops

890
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:21,339
occasionally to kind of figure out who's

891
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,169
got what when I go to different stores

892
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,058
on different days of the week because

893
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,009
there's a store down south but on

894
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:29,109
Tuesday does turfy Tuesday and these

895
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:32,019
violas are on sale and then there's a

896
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:33,490
store up north that does a sale that I

897
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:34,839
like and then there's another store

898
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,539
right down the street from them and I

899
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,859
try to time up there too sales yeah just

900
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,139
try to pay attention go to those sale

901
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:43,029
days but you guys like Mike said you can

902
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,550
leave a dispensary without buying

903
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:47,589
anything this is your medicine that you

904
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,269
were buying for maybe you're shopping

905
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:51,069
for the day maybe you're shopping for

906
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,750
three days I usually shop for four or

907
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:54,849
five days at a time when I go in I want

908
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,579
to get my medicine for the next three to

909
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:59,500
five days doctor drive back and wait in

910
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:01,359
line and if I'm driving up to Colorado

911
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,640
Springs that's a 45-minute Drive each

912
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,369
direction plus I stop for food Mike's

913
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,360
been hostage in my car for that

914
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,979
45-minute Drive up there twenty or

915
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,990
thirty minutes into the dispensary and

916
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,960
then another hour getting food plus a

917
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,220
piece table drive 45 minute drive back

918
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,049
and then I want him to come hang out and

919
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,569
take dad's after Mike is a hostage for

920
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:21,609
that whole thing so Mike in conflict

921
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,960
nine hours yeah but it's [ __ ] awesome

922
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,149
nine hours if I can make that happen

923
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,870
less frequently that saves us time and

924
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,720
gas money

925
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:31,299
so yeah but my point is don't feel

926
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,220
obligated to any dispensary if you're if

927
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,690
they're not it's it's like anything if

928
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,190
you're going to the tire shop and the

929
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,019
tire shop has [ __ ] tires you go to a

930
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,480
different tire shop if you don't shop at

931
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:42,190
Kmart for the [ __ ] tuxedo I mean if

932
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,779
you want good quality go shop around

933
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,429
look at different dispensaries look at

934
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:46,519
weed maps I know

935
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:48,830
weed Maps as a weird

936
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,480
thing they don't pay me I use weed maps

937
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:51,919
I know what I'm shopping for I can go to

938
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,569
weed maps and look at the dispensary and

939
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,710
see what they've got and then you don't

940
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:56,419
have to go in there and look at all

941
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,860
hundred jars and feel overwhelmed is

942
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,850
that kind of suck sometimes

943
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:03,819
be leery of the review section as well

944
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:06,829
take it take your time to dig through

945
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:10,849
because a lot of the more reputable

946
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:14,389
sites like weed maps and a few of the

947
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:19,549
earliest Leafly like leaf buyer google

948
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,230
they they let the business ding down bad

949
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:24,319
reviews from time to time but they won't

950
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,660
let him take them all down especially

951
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,210
the really legit like spelled out bad

952
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,450
reviews where the customer is specific

953
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,890
with their complaints and not abusive in

954
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,360
their language those all end up staying

955
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,509
up and if you scroll down a little bit

956
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,819
you'll get past all the $2 off your

957
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:43,640
pre-roll for a five star review reviews

958
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:45,740
and get to the real meat of the store

959
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,790
and that's this stuff you're looking for

960
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,779
especially when it comes to like

961
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:53,319
selection pricing service right and then

962
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:55,819
their menus are their menus updated a

963
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:57,439
lot of places their menus haven't been

964
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:58,759
updated in two months and you go in and

965
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320

you go in there and you say hey I see

971
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,259
the golden goat can I get an 8 the

972
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,459
golden go out they're gonna go we don't

973
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,990
have gold and gold you pull up that

974
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,130
[ __ ] weed Maps page ago look it shows

975
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,839
right here that you got gold and go

976
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,070
they'll give you a deal

977
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,570
they'll do something for it because that

978
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,519
is their responsibility to keep that

979
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,080
[ __ ] updated I've driven to a dispensary

980
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,239
because they said they've had something

981
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,069
they didn't they felt really bad they

982
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,599
were like hey the girl that was supposed

983
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,980
to be updating it was actually there she

984
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,319
kind of got in trouble I felt bad but

985
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:37,789
they gave me a fat deal so it that's

986
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,980
something that every shop should be on

987
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:42,019
top of don't feel bad about shopping for

988
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,019
quality leaving without a purchase or

989
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:48,289
dinging them fruit inaccurate menus like

990
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,148
this is just standard [ __ ] before I've

991
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:53,000
talked about not tipping bud tenders

992
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:55,069
because I feel like they I don't know

993
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,840
sometimes it totally depends on the

994
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,880
interaction right yeah I always agreed

995
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,858
with that part of the concentrate today

996
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,269
I knew what I wanted

997
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:02,710
like I want three of these things and

998
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,108
they're basically the budtender had to

999
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,519
put three packs in a jar or in a baggie

1000
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:09,400
and hand him to me and take my money

1001
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:11,798
right and I did today point you're

1002
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,139
tipping for them counting your change

1003
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:15,489
back correctly right and she was smart

1004
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,348
enough to give me my change in once

1005
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,818
which is part of why she got a tip she

1006
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,109
wasn't gonna get all five of it but

1007
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:21,759
since she gave him back in one she got

1008
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:23,318
three of them because she was smart

1009
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:25,059
enough to break it down into some ones

1010
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:26,558
which is that was the only determining

1011
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:28,119
factors if she gives me one she's gonna

1012
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,730
get a few of them if she does not she

1013
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,380
don't get five right that wasn't worth

1014
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,028
five it was worth three and they were

1015
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,009
super friendly they're super nice but I

1016
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:38,289
tipped I would have you I probably would

1017
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:41,980
attempt to but the guy that was in front

1018
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:43,390
of me was not pleasant and I felt bad

1019
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,099
for the bud tenders I was like damn

1020
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:47,469
there that guy kind of just [ __ ] your

1021
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,849
day up so here's maybe this will fix it

1022
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:50,588
you know that's part of why tip today

1023
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:54,970
and I'm not against tipping a budtender

1024
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:56,828
I just I'm all about it but before I

1025
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,659
didn't do it as frequently and you have

1026
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,480
to do something too I don't know I

1027
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,858
almost always tip something but some

1028
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,619
people definitely get the loose change

1029
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:07,058
and other people will get a five you

1030
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:08,710
just it completely depends on your

1031
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:11,048
interaction if I walk in and go get me

1032
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:13,630
two of those and you just sort of nod at

1033
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:15,460
me and we're done like if I walk in and

1034
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,079
you know and you're like oh like and

1035
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,690
this is in your wheelhouse this came in

1036
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,359
just so you know I'm you might begin and

1037
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,039
I said yeah actually she had to go get

1038
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,909
those out of the back today so she had

1039
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,680
to go for a little walk

1040
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:28,358
carry some stuff so I guess it was worth

1041
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,460
me helping her out but yeah the guy

1042
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:33,909
before me broke was not pleasant he was

1043
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,429
in a bad bad mood today you know I've

1044
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:38,858
been there both ways yeah on both sides

1045
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:42,129

the answer to question number two bill

1096
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:46,569

00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,189
going to ask you to explain say please

1100
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,429
allow this tasting bill this is

1101
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:00,369
something we need here in Colorado

1102
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:03,579
basically this if you're not familiar it

1103
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:06,760
allows existing cannabis legal cannabis

1104
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:09,909
businesses so licensed dispensaries to

1105
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,510
allow on-site consumption of non

1106
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:15,000
combustible cannabis product

1107
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,790
so they can set up a little area where

1108
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,820
they could perfectly legally set up a

1109
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:23,550
dab bar or an edible sampling room where

1110
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,240
you can go in and while you're you're

1111
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,619
shopping you bring yourself a driver

1112
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,709
just so you can enjoy yourself to the

1113
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,960
fullest and go in if you you know been

1114
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,900
looking at inaudible you having you know

1115
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,949
honing up and tried yet but always just

1116
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,300
kind of notice while you're in their

1117
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:42,509
home what does the peanut butter Buddha

1118
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,339
taste like [ __ ] banana what I need to

1119
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,680
try that yeah and you'll have a chance

1120
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:49,409
to just go in and get a smaller portion

1121
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,259
of it get a sample of and try it take a

1122
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:53,759
dab of an extract maybe you're not

1123
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,589
familiar with or a company you're not

1124
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,030
familiar with there's a couple of

1125
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:59,009
different options that we'd be able to

1126
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:03,450
do that we've not all allowed to do

1127
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,710
right now um if this bill gets signed

1128
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:06,960
it's gonna take a while to get

1129
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,269
implemented it's gonna take a while to

1130
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,309
figure out what best practices are and

1131
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:13,320
and see exactly how it plays out but

1132
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:15,000
this is a big step forward for Colorado

if this passes miracle of miracles and

1177

[ __ ] it up for the rest of us

1179
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,059

1180

don't overdo it make an ass yourself run

1182
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,929
everybody have an exit plan what are you

1183
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,400
going to do after this day at home are

1184
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:10,629
you on your lunch break is this your

1185
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,880
first step think it through and the

1186
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,590
second point is the the anti park

1187
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,349
community around the country such as it

1188
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,390
is is pretty shitty at most what they're

1189
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:21,639
trying to do but one of the things that

1190
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,199
pretty good at is inundating a specific

1191
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:27,309
person in government with a lot of

1192
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,199
emails about a specific issue and this

1193
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:30,969
is one they've hit a couple of times and

1194
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,149
I'm not surprised it's sat on the

1195
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:36,629
governor's desk as long as it has

1196
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,650
considering the amount of anti pot

1197
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,599
contact the governor tell him not to

1198
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,460
allow this it'll lead to dead people on

1199
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,599
the roads that are not about type posts

1200
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,400
I've seen so uh get active get informed

1201
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,809
contact your governor if you're in

1202
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,970
Colorado right now to contact

1203
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:54,969
Hickenlooper would be very very helpful

1204
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:56,649
to the community I know a lot of people

1205
00:42:54,969 --> 00:43:00,519

1209
