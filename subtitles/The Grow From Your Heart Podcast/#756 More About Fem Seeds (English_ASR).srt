00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:19,679
podcast world i'm your host my friends

00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,919
call me rosta jeff this is episode 756

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,759
of the grow from your heart podcast i'm

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,679
coming to you on a super hot colorado

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,679
day i've got a great episode lined up

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,678
for you before we get to the main topic

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,518
of today's show i should do an update

10
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,519
from a previous episode in the last

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,839
episode i talked a lot about pests and

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,920
pest management today i was actually at

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
the grow store grabbing some supplies

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
and i thought that i should warn you

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,359
that one of the most common places for

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
you to get bugs is that grow store

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,119
anything that comes from that grow store

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,878
may possibly be carrying spider mites it

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,878
could have thrips it could have aphids

20
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,960
it could have bad [ __ ] on it also

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,878
anytime you go to the dispensary keep in

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
mind a lot of growers and smokers and

23
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,558
consumers are there you're risking

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
spider mites also anytime you go to your

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,159
friend's place that does grow you are

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,519
risking spider mites if you're in a

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,599
friend's car that grows if your friend

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
that grows comes to your place you are

29
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,399
also risking a spider mite infestation

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
as i was at the grow store today

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
i realized i failed to mention those

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
things thought that i would throw that

33
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,118
in there remind you there are a lot of

34
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,199
other options for getting bugs not just

35
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,599
the only places not only the places i

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
mentioned but also the grow store the

37
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,118
dispensary if you take your date to the

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,519
botanical garden if you go out to the

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,759
park if you go on a hike those are all

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,118
potential places for spider mites all

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
right i feel like i left that out wanted

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,560

the good [ __ ] will be sold out by then

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,239
that's enough advertising let's get into

98
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,318
this podcast here i do have a great

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,158
question they came from the youtube

100
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
channel i usually don't answer questions

101
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,798
from youtube but somebody sent me this

102
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,079
and they said this would be great for

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,280
the show i agree it says can you touch

104
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,440
on stabilizing feminized reversals on a

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
future episode so i think what you're

106
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,318
asking is if i can basically talk about

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
making and stabilizing feminized seeds

108
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,359
so let's talk about making fem seeds

109
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,679
then we'll kind of jump into the

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
stabilization part of the question what

111
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
does he mean by feminized reversals

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,719
feminized reversals as making fem seeds

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
making using a reversed plant to make

114
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,560
feminized seeds really briefly i'll tell

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
you how i do that

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
i very carefully and we'll touch more on

117
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,958
this in the part of the episode here i

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,360
very carefully select a female plant

119
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,199
that i will choose to make a pollen

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,519
donor that's right i said that a female

121
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,238
plant will be treated with a solution i

122
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,319
make my own silver thiosulfate solution

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
then i treat that female plant at a

124
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,079
certain dilution at certain intervals on

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
a very tight schedule it will get

126
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
sprayed with that silver thiosulfate

127
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,159
that female plant will then create

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
pollen sacs that pollen will only

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
contain female chromosomes because the

130
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,719
plant that i have selected is purely

131
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,519
female so we'll pass female chromosomes

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000
i then take that female pollen and put

133
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,758
that on another female plant now all of

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
the seeds that come from that female

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
plant that receive the pollen will be

136
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,439
female seeds because i have not

137
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,319
introduced any male chromosomes into the

138
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,160
equation so that is making feminized

139
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,439
seeds they said feminized reversals it

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
comes from a reversal to make the

141
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,918
feminized seeds so now they want to talk

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
about the word they chose here is

143
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,560
stabilizing feminized seeds that's where

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
this gets fun because the word

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,879
stabilization gets kind of tossed around

146
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
in the cannabis community in a lot of

147
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,639
weird ways stabilization doesn't only

148
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,519
necessarily refer to sexual stability

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,079
that is a thing but stabilization

150
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,599
more refers to in the agricultural world

151
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,719
stabilization more

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,879
refers to uniformity amongst phenotypes

153
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
so if we threw out a hundred seeds we

154
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,399
shouldn't see a hundred different

155
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
phenotypes we should hopefully uh if

156
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,918
we've done the stabilization the way

157
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,239
that agriculture big ag likes it you're

158
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,918
gonna see one maybe two phenotypes if

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
you go look in a field if you look in a

160
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,359
soy field a big field that's run by

161
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
commercial farmers all of those

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,879
phenotypes all that corn looks the same

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
they didn't grow clones of the corn

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,918
they've got it narrowed down that's gmo

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
corn so it's kind of they're cheating

166
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,639
but they've got that corn figured out to

167
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:55,279
where every seed looks the same that is

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
stabilization those seeds are stable

169
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,758
every time i grow this corn in this part

170
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,600
of the country in this location it will

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
get three feet tall then it will begin

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
to flower it will take this many weeks

173
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
to flower it will take this much

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
nitrogen they've got that [ __ ] seed

175
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,120
dialed in that is stabilization amongst

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
the agricultural environment that's what

177
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,038
stabilization refers to a lot of times

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
when people say stable and cannabis they

179
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,519
say that's not stable they're only

180
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,519
referring to sexual stability meaning

181
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,839
that some of the feminized seeds will

182
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,719
show intersex traits or also the regular

183
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,239
seeds will show intersex traits that is

184
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
often times what people mean by

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,439
stability so

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
um i'm going to talk more about

187
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,759
stabilizing them for uh the phenotype

188
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,959
because in my opinion

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,600
if the proper plants were selected to

190
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,478
make feminized seeds that is where the

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,599
stabilization happens for making the

192
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,199
sexual stability if both of the plants

193
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,839
that you have chosen to work with to

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,038
make female seeds are true females and

195
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,000
do not contain intersex traits then you

196
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,038
can definitely make stable female plants

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
from there but it's all about the

198
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,519
selection if you don't do rigorous

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
testing and careful selection then it is

200
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,000
going to be really hard to stabilize

201
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,280
your feminized crosses sexually if

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,879
you've done the proper work so let's

203
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,079
talk about doing the proper work what do

204
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,079
i mean

205
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,598
to find out if a female is a true female

206
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,038
you've got to give it some tests now

207
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,439
let's

208
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,680
almost every cannabis plant eventually

209
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,598
uh some there's some way to make that

210
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,800
plant uh show you intersex traits

211
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,598
there's some way to make that plant

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
produce a seed but under most conditions

213
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,279
under a lot of stress most of the plants

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,960
i'm working with will not show us

215
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,959
intersex traits

216
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,159
so i will do things like put a female

217
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,478
plant into flower for 12 or 14 days as

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
soon as she shows me i'm a female i'm in

219
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,519
flower guess what i do put it back to

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,400
another time just change it to 18 6 19 5

221
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,719
24 and 0 just change that timer see what

222
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,638
it does then in like 10 days we'll put

223
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
it back on 12 12 and see what that plant

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
does does it freak out does it do weird

225
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,560
[ __ ] does it crinkle up does it die do

226
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
the leaves start curling does it get the

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,959
claw does it get the sunshine finger

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,120
what does it do does it show me intersex

229
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,959
traits i pay attention to that i do that

230
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
to every plant that i breed with i love

231
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,638
to stress the [ __ ] out of them i also

232
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,399
give those plants to friends of mine who

233
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,840
i know are going to abuse these plants

234
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,679
they're not as good of a grower as a lot

235
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,439
of people they make a lot of mistakes

236
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
those are the people that will find out

237
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,519
if that plant is going to give me

238
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
problems so before i choose to breed

239
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,159
with anything if i'm making regular

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,439
seeds or feminized seeds i will stress

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,000
test my plants rigorously very very

242
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,599
vigorous and rigorously i will over feed

243
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
them i will under feed them i'll mess

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
with the light cycle i'll give them too

245
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,599
much heat i'll give them too much cold

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,918
if those plants show me any sign of

247
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
intersex traits guess what no breeding

248
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,240
you don't get to go in the breeding room

249
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,399
i may grow it i may keep it i may breed

250
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,159
it for myself to other plants to keep it

251
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,559
for myself but it will not make it to

252
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,519
the production line for you guys to ever

253
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,919
purchase ever grow those are for me so i

254
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,399
will do a test on every plant the pollen

255
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,159
donor and the pollen receiver before i

256
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,399
ever think about doing a feminized

257
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,879
reversal now the people say

258
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,879
that femme seeds are made from an

259
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,958
intersex plant that it's a you're making

260
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,039
the plant hermaphrodite no that is very

261
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,759
wrong that is not accurate stop saying

262
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,519
that um the word hermaphrodite and

263
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,919
feminized seeds should not be in the

264
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,039
same mix at all if you breed with

265
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,360
intersex plants you create more intersex

266
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,360
plants so to get stabilized feminized

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,800
crosses i'm going backwards here the way

268
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,278
to do it is to start with stable female

269
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,359
genetics and yes you can use a feminized

270
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,559
female plant and a feminized female

271
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,959
plant and you can reverse one and

272
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,879
pollinate the other and make more female

273
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,479
plants that way yes you can don't worry

274
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,879
that one's female don't worry that one's

275
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
not female or feminized i mean you can

276
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,799
breed with the femmes just like the regs

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,639
the only difference is there was no male

278
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,240
chromosome involved in that breeding

279
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,679
project

280
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
now that we've kind of touched based on

281
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,479
the differences between sexual stability

282
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
and actual phenotypical stability let's

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,639
talk a little bit about making feminized

284
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,078
seeds and some of the uh the traits i

285
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,159
see in these plants let's talk a little

286
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,519
bit about the the stability if you will

287
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,278
of these plants

288
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
there are two different options when

289
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,240
we're making feminized seeds we've got

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,519
what are known as an s1 or i guess there

291
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
are more options but what we're going to

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,759
start with are the s1 and the r1 the

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,519
other options are basically going to be

294
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,519
filial generations with different higher

295
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,278
numbers at the end but for now we're

296
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,519
going to focus on the two we're going to

297
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:33,838
focus on s and r s stands for self let's

298
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,919
just say we took a golden goat female

299
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
and another golden goat female and i

300
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,000
reversed one golden goat and put the

301
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,958
pollen onto the other golden goat i have

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,200
just made s1 those are self seeds it's a

303
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,119
golden goat that [ __ ] itself you'll

304
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
never forget that that golden goat

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
[ __ ] itself those are self seeds the

306
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
seeds that come out of that are going to

307
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,600
be pure golden goat feminized seeds that

308
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,120
is an s1 itself itself now the other

309
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,759
option is an r an r1 a reversal of the

310
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,159
first generation so an r would be if i

311
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,039
took that golden goat plant and reversed

312
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,199
it but if i put that pollen on any other

313
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,399
female plant the seeds that come from

314
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,959
that are an r1 that's a reversal one a

315
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,759
first generation reversal it is also an

316
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,879
f1 that does qualify as an f1

317
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,600
but

318
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,838
in the cannabis space in the marketing

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
the labeling realm on the websites of

320
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
buying and selling seeds people like to

321
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
know if they're getting fems or regs one

322
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,319
way to clearly indicate that is to put

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,399
that that is an r1 that's a reversal a

324
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,800
first generation reversal the first

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,200
filial generation of a reversal so if

326
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,759
you put that that pollen on anything but

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
itself you have now done an r that's a

328
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,639
reversal you've used reversed pollen to

329
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,559
put on any other plant so if i put this

330
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
has been done if we put reversed golden

331
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,599
goat on a lemon skunk female that does

332
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,719
make lemon jeffrey

333
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,600
seeds lemon jeffrey reversal filial

334
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,879
generation number one so let's talk

335
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,920
about those two different things now

336
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,320
we've got the selfing and the reversal

337
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,559
uh the r and the s let's talk about what

338
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,600
i see in those and talk about stability

339
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,919
amongst those plants when i do the s1s i

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,159
see a lot of stability

341
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,199
being a breeder that works with f1s of

342
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,879
regular seeds and works with f2s and f3s

343
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,759
i understand the variations that i'm

344
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,958
seeing in my experience in my opinion

345
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,439
when i make the s1 i'm gonna say about

346
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,838
70 to 75 percent of those phenotypes

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
look just like the mommy some of them

348
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
look a little bit different but

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,720
sometimes also those are my favorites

350
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,799
those weirdos that don't look like the

351
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
mom that brought out some great

352
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,719
grandparent that i don't even know what

353
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,239
it is sometimes those are amazing so

354
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
most of the time when i'm working with

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,320
the s1s i want to say 75-ish percent of

356
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,078
those are going to look just like the

357
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,278
mommy which because you've got that's

358
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,638
all that you put in the mix you took

359
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,480
golden goat you took golden goat you

360
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
poured golden goat in a pan it's going

361
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,159
to come out looking like golden goat the

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
options are that you're going to see

363
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,679
parents of the golden goat and great

364
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,679
grandparents and grandparents of the

365
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,159
golden goat in that mix you may see old

366
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,239
stuff pop up most of the time you're

367
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,240
going to see the golden goat in that mix

368
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
now let's talk about the r's the

369
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,879
reversals let's say we took a golden

370
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,680
goat female and we put that pollen on a

371
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,958
um

372
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
when we put it on the lemon skunk it

373
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,518
makes lemon jeffrey that lemon skunk

374
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,679
really dominates that mix most of those

375
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,919
phenotypes look a lot like the lemon

376
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,159
jeffrey i probably are the lemon skunk i

377
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,479
would say 50 of them come out more lemon

378
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,120
skunk than golden goat okay now let's

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,000
talk about putting that same reversed

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,480
golden goat pollen on a female lemon

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
skunk plant and that makes lemon jeffrey

382
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
r1 we've talked about that a moment ago

383
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
the first filial generation of a

384
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
reversal and i've called it lemon

385
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,000
jeffrey it's the lemon skunk female

386
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
pollinated by the reversed golden goat

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,679
that's the r1 most of those phenotypes

388
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,278
come out looking very much like the

389
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,799
lemon skunk plant that's just something

390
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,399
that comes from that plant from that

391
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,159
cross so i know that the common

392
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,759
phenotype there is going to look a lot

393
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,078
like the lemon skunk but then it's got

394
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,759
the golden goat potency and the speed

395
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,479
and the vigor of the golden goat when it

396
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,039
grows the lemon skunk has a very unique

397
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
leaf shape a very unique growth pattern

398
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,719
and structure it's got a very great

399
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,958
aroma you can see that when you breed to

400
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
it i definitely see it come through

401
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,559
most of the phenotypes look a lot like

402
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
that lemon skunk but there are a lot of

403
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,319
phenotypes that look a little bit more

404
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,639
golden goat and there are things that

405
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
kind of lean toward really lemon skunk

406
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
and a little bit more and a little bit

407
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,838
less golden goat but a lot of it gets

408
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,838
that lemon skunk i can identify those

409
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,880
phenotypes i want to say that amongst

410
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,600
that cross probably 60 to 70 percent of

411
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,600
those look a lot like the lemon skunk

412
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
now let's talk more about the golden

413
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,159
goat what if i put that pollen on the

414
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,719
platinum tangie which has been done that

415
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,759
makes the orange gasm when i do that one

416
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,240
i see basically 50 50 amongst most of

417
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,120
the phenotypes i'm going to say 70 of

418
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,759
those phenotypes are 50 50. it's got the

419
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
uh the uh platinum tangy orange flavor

420
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,679
and the golden goat growth shape and

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,480
structure and that buzz and it smells

422
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,799
like the oranges it's basically 50 50.

423
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
that's 70 percent of them there are 30

424
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,879
percent however they will get really

425
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,639
tall and really crazy the platinum

426
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,120
tangie doesn't do that golden goat

427
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,198
doesn't do that but the island sweet

428
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,198
skunk and the hawaiian sativa in there

429
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,958
they definitely do that that is a parent

430
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,639
of the golden goat so we're seeing

431
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,599
grandparents come through in some

432
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,560
phenotypes now i said that 70 of them

433
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
are 50

434
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,198
and 30 percent are going to be the

435
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,958
outliers you're going to see that really

436
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,240
tall one you're going to find one that's

437
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,838
a little bit shorter that one's really

438
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,360
platinum tangy then you're gonna find

439
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
one that gets a real tall spear that's

440
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
really golden goatee but the stability

441
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,159
that i see in there is that most of

442
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,199
those look like the 50 50 mix it's going

443
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,039
to be very

444
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,879
cross dependent which plant dominated

445
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,399
the mix did the male win did the female

446
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,559
win did they mix 50 50. as a breeder my

447
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,559
hopes and goals most of the time are to

448
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,078
get that perfect 50 50 mix i can't

449
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,239
guarantee that because that's just how

450
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,159
genetics work uh the lemon skunk when i

451
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,560
cross to that it wins it wins most

452
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,958
crosses it kind of dominates the mix but

453
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,799
whatever i put it to really complements

454
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,399
that mix so to wrap it around and talk

455
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,359
about stability what i'm seeing is when

456
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,320
i breed with the s1s is that i'm getting

457
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
70

458
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,879
common phenotypes when i breed with the

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,440
r1s i'm probably getting 70

460
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,360
50 to 75 common phenotypes it just

461
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
depends on the plants that i'm breeding

462
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
with it depends on the mixture there

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,159
like i said before some plants are going

464
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,919
to be more dominant in a mix and some

465
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,120
are going to be less dominant their

466
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,799
trains are going to carry through you

467
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,078
may get a couple of traits that you

468
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,599
really liked you might not get what you

469
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,638
wanted it may be scattered amongst

470
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,199
phenotypes but i do see the stability i

471
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:50,240
don't feel the need most of the time to

472
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:53,278
take a feminized cross past the s1 or r1

473
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,839
generation i've done it and it locks

474
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,919
things in but then i can't breed to that

475
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
because it makes things go weird so i've

476
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,319
made s2s of the grateful dog i've done a

477
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,919
back cross project of the grateful dog

478
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,720
i've made a grateful dog that will not

479
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:09,038
reverse i've feminized it so much that

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,360
when i do treat it with a strong silver

481
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,359
sulfate solution it will not reverse i

482
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,798
can't get that one to flip so if you

483
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,798
play with them too much you do start

484
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,720
creating weird things but it all depends

485
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,639
on the plants you can create wonky [ __ ]

486
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,360
by using too many feminized crosses you

487
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
can create great [ __ ] by using too much

488
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,759
feminized work in there sometimes you

489
