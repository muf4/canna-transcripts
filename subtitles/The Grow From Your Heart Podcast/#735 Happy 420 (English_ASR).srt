90
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,158
of people are smoking i've been a lot of

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
places there are no mass it has been a

92
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,120
great time now let's segue into talking

93
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,759
about something that did change for 420

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,799
this year usually in denver we have a

95
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,719
420 freedom rally where people gather in

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,760
civic center park and they openly

97
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,080
consume cannabis is sort of a open

98
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,919
what is it a friendly peaceful protest

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
and a display of uh we want to smoke

100
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,318
cannabis openly and be peaceful and be

101
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,639
civil people so every year at 4 20 in

102
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,798
denver april 20th of course we would do

103
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,639
that in denver colorado at civic center

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
park uh we would get is at civic center

105
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,439
park is at the capitol i think it's

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
severe i could be wrong with the words

107
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,039
i'm saying with the location but we all

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,158
knew where it was uh that one big spot

109
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,079
where everybody was right at the

110
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,239
capitals at capitol park anyway somebody

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
correct me give me the right location i

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,560
knew where to drive and where to park

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
and how to walk there i didn't remember

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
the name of it

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
anyhow the point is we would all gather

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,438
there uh often and smoke freely for 4

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,039
20. a lot of people would hang out there

118
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,318
would be thousands of people there there

119
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,679
would be booths there there'd be people

120
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,958
giving out water

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
vending drinks a lot of people would

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,478
give away cannabis it was a good time it

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
was a good friendly open environment

124
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,758
there would always be a drum circle a

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
bunch of people smoking weed hanging out

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
there would be bands

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,840
over the years i've seen it get a little

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
bit more organized and a little more

129
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,599
corporate maybe the word they actually

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
built a fence around one part and built

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
a concert inside of the fenced area and

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
charged people money to get into the

133
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,519
concert which i thought was weird

134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
because

135
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,359
that fence didn't stop the sound we

136
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
could still hear all of the musicians

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
playing but if you want to get down

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
there into the concert area you did have

139
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,918
to pay some money to get into there

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,360
however there have been some changes

141
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:53,279
this year the 420 rally has been turned

142
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,120
into the denver 420 festival that's

143
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,638
right the 420 freedom festival they

144
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
built a cage around the entire thing

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,079
they put up fences around the entire

146
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
venue around the entire event where we

147
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,680
would normally congregate freely and

148
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,758
they were charging a ticket price to get

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,079
into that area they also put out a

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,240
notice saying no cannabis consumption

151
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,079
would be tolerated now i know denver i

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,079
know colorado i know my friends i know

153
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,279
my crew i'm sure some cannabis was

154
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
consumed i'm sure the police were

155
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,279
outnumbered and outdone you can't stop

156
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,758
all of us but they were saying they were

157
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,839
not going to allow permit or endorse

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,439
any sort of cannabis consumption trading

159
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,799
giving away vending it was all going to

160
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,279
be shut down and people would be

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
arrested they also did mention that

162
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,599
there would be i read in one article

163
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
said five another article said seven

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
beer tents available sponsored by local

165
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
beer companies so they've really taken a

166
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
huge turn with this we used to go smoke

167
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,639
cannabis in the park for free now we've

168
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,879
got to pay money to get in we cannot

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
smoke cannabis bill we can buy beer at

170
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,000
the place what a big turn

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
that is partially because of

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
legalization that is mostly because of

173
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
legalization everything is different now

174
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
they have changed the rules it's gotten

175
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,879
so popular we've gotten so uh over

176
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,359
consumed overpopulated with people

177
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,279
coming to smoke on 420 inundated is the

178
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
word my brain was fishing for things are

179
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,599
different now so they've had to change

180
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
things up pay attention in your area in

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,039
your jurisdiction your locale when you

182
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,879
are making rules writing proposals for

183
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,079
legalization of cannabis in your area

184
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,120
these are the kinds of things that can

185
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,879
happen

186
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,639
it is great to have recreational and

187
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,360
legal cannabis here but i wish we would

188
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
have done several things differently i

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
wish we would have had places where we

190
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,439
can consume we've had legal cannabis

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
here

192
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,399
for

193
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,400
i'm going to say [ __ ] over 10 years

194
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,000
12 14 issues we've had legal cannabis

195
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,000
here either medical or recreational

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,439
cannabis approximately 14 years i'm

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
gonna try to remember off the top of my

198
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,719
head we've had legal cannabis here

199
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
there's not been a safe place until

200
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,039
recently there have not been safe places

201
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,638
for people to go and smoke the cannabis

202
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,639
which they can legally acquire here in

203
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
colorado when you're making the rules in

204
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,519
your area make sure to include places

205
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,758
that you can consume cannabis if it's a

206
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,519
social lounge if it's a medicating

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,439
lounge something where people can get

208
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,359
out of their car and go smoke inside

209
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,038
somewhere safely right now most of the

210
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
legal states you got to go smoke in your

211
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,759
car you got to go smoke some more shady

212
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,598
and that's illegal that's going to get

213
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
you in trouble make a place we used to

214
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,279
have the canna cabinet we used to have a

215
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,719
few places but legalization shut that

216
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,638
down a lot of the rules and laws were

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
made to put those places out of business

218
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
and prevent that from happening so when

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,639
you do make those rules try to include

220
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
somewhere to consume the cannabis in

221
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,639
your legalization your legislation your

222
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
regula your regulations and your

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,079
proposals for all of your goods because

224
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
we want you to be able to consume the

225
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,439
cannabis which we are legalizing we can

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
also you want to be able to grow it make

227
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,918
sure you can grow cannabis in your

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,399
legalization proposal we want home

229
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,439
growths to be legalized

230
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,439
the other thing i would make sure to

231
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,759
have in there is some sort of legal

232
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,560
events we want to be able to have events

233
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,400
um

234
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
it's i don't know what the feeling is it

235
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,399
feels it feels shitty to be honest that

236
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,758
i can pay money to get into this concert

237
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,758
to go see these bands that are playing

238
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,439
and hang out with my friends but i can't

239
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,680
smoke a joint but everybody around i

240
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,360
don't drink alcohol i don't i choose not

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,038
to drink alcohol because i cannot behave

242
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,720
responsibly once i do drink alcohol and

243
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,719
i know that about myself i haven't

244
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
consumed alcohol since i got my very

245
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,479
first medical cannabis card in 2008

246
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,478
haven't had alcohol since then there's

247
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,478
no need for it i can buy and consume all

248
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,719
the ganja that i need that fixes 90 of

249
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
my problems alcohol causes me problems i

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,319
don't drink it but everybody around me

251
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,598
is drinking beer getting hammered

252
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,120
getting [ __ ] faced some of them drink

253
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,360
responsibly some of them drink

254
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
excessively there's the full range but

255
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
i'm seeing lots of different types of

256
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
behavior stem from the alcohol i can't

257
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,079
reach in my pocket and smoke a bowl

258
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
without checking every direction and see

259
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,038
if there's a cop or security guard

260
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,718
around me because i'll go to jail for

261
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,479
getting stoned we all know i'm not going

262
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,919
to make the argument we try to leave try

263
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,440
to try to chill out an event the drunk

264
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,799
guy gets in a fight the stone guy wants

265
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
nachos right we're not going to go there

266
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,559
but legalization put us in this position

267
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,399
where i can only go in there and consume

268
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,000
alcohol all of the alcohol which i can

269
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
afford which is probably like 12 bucks a

270
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,039
cup or something but i can't smoke any

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,799
weed in the 420 festival kind of

272
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,319
[ __ ] is that so be careful is what

273
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,240
i'm saying when you do write these rules

274
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,399
propose these rules if you're one of the

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,159
people that is uh advocating fighting

276
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
for cannabis in your area make sure you

277
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,919
include somewhere to consume the

278
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,320
cannabis and also make some sort of

279
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,000
provisions regulations rules amendments

280
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
uh to where we can have some sort of

281
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,839
parties gatherings festivals where we

282
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,839
can legally consume cannabis what we've

283
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
done here in colorado is it makes it

284
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
really hard for the illegal

285
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
establishments to participate in any of

286
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,360
the events because they have to

287
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
illegally bring product they have to

288
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
legally display it it makes a big [ __ ]

289
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
show so all of the events now are kind

290
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
of smaller than they used to be they're

291
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,000
low-key they're a little bit more

292
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,440
private we can't advertise like we would

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,639
like to because that will set us up to

294
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
get in trouble we have to be very

295
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,319
secretive until the day of the event we

296
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
could be like it's here that way it

297
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
limits the opportunity for us to get in

298
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,799
trouble so um to recap on all that make

299
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,959
rules so that you can consume the

300
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,439
cannabis somewhere some sort of cannabis

301
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,958
lounge the dab lounge the smoke lounge

302
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
the church of ganja whatever you want to

303
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,719
make it make sure they're somewhere in

304
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,800
your community area jurisdiction which

305
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
you reside over for your legalization

306
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,319
amendments and movements to where we can

307
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,078
smoke some cannabis there also make sure

308
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
everybody can grow the cannabis they

309
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,078
need to supply for themselves then also

310
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,480
try to make some sort of rules to where

311
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,399
we can have freedom with our cannabis

312
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
festivals gatherings festivals events

313
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,159
parties tour the companies that we're

314
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,518

317
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,879

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,160
just get a pre-roll it's probably not

329
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,838
going to be a real good pre-roll but

330
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,360
it's better than not being able to do it

331
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,880
at all that's what i think we should be

332
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
able to or maybe some edibles maybe sell

333
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,120
me 25 milligram edibles at the concert

334
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,879
so we can get lit up speaking of edibles

335
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
i'm going to do a patreon only episode

336
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,639
where i'm going to eat some edibles stay

337
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,078
tuned and look forward to that one all

338
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,480
right i'm stoned obviously i've been

339
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,639
smoking some uh what was it it's the

340
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,079
garlic banger live rosin from green dot

341
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,480
labs that may be one of my favorite

342
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,078
concentrates i did say it was rosin i

343
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,519
know that's crazy it's really delicious

344
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,078
gets me high as [ __ ] so make sure that

345
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,159
you get consumption rules homegrown

346
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,599
rules event rules make sure the rules

347
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,559
are what you want them because we kind

348
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
of

349
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,159
pushed a lot of great [ __ ] out of the

350
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
industry when we made a lot of rules i

351
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,480
think it was sb 1280 that really messed

352
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
up a lot of things here in colorado we

353
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,920
should have seen it coming we should

354
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,199
have had more people on our side we

355
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,240
should have voted against that we should

356
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
have made

357
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
more awareness people didn't even see it

358
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
coming people didn't even know about it

359
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
so pay attention for things like that if

360
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
you are responsible for the legalization

361
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,680
movements in your area all right i feel

362
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,958
like i've rambled on for several minutes

363
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,639
about that part i did say this was going

364
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,159
to be a quick show to test the equipment

365
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,078
i do have a couple of more topics i'd

366
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,039
like to cover there are going to be some

367
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,879
discord server updates i apologize if

368
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,559
you have felt uncomfortable on the

369
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,159
discord server if you've had problems

370
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,239
logging in if you've been booted from

371
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,439
the server accidentally or on purpose

372
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
there have been some changes in the

373
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
discord there will be some updates you

374
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
may have to find the new discord servers

375
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
there are two servers the ire genetics

376
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
irie army community i'm not sure what we

377
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,800
titled the new server page and then

378
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,399
there's also rosted jeff's secret stash

379
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,559
do your best to find both of those

380
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,759
servers um we'll all be there hanging

381
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,000
out you'll know when you're on the right

382
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,159
one uh the old one will be phased out

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,919
very soon the new one will be updated

384
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,679
and totally correct

385
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,199
moderated um

386
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,879
managed and i'll be there more that was

387
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
i wasn't on the disc the older discord

388
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,278
enough some things got away from us so

389
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,439
we had to regroup rebuild i do apologize

390
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,838
we will be back better and stronger than

391
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,839
ever before stay tuned you guys the new

392
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
discord will be popping up probably

393
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,399
right around the same time as this

394
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,560
episode if we timed it correctly another

395
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
thing i should mention um where were we

396
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,000
i'm working on patreon content i think i

397
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
just mentioned that i was going to do a

398
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,958
patreon episode where i'm going to eat

399
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
some edibles

400
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,159
i'm going to try to record that if all

401
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
things go well i do have a guest invited

402
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,919
to come over here in a few hours we'll

403
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,599
record that try to get that up to you uh

404
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,838

405
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
up early early next month i do promise

406
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,600
that episode is coming uh depends on if

407
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,719
my partner in crime can make it over

408
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,560
here to eat edibles with me on this show

409
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
another thing i should talk about is i'm

410
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,559
slowly restocking all the vendors i get

411
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,959
a lot of messages of course i am also

412
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:21,278
the uh sole proprietor the head breeder

413
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,879
the hmfc of irie genetics premium seeds

414
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,159
a lot of people are messaging me and

415
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,320
asking me where are the seed restocks

416
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,559
you've got to be patient uh it is just

417
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,720
me mainly packing up beans i get them

418
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,039
packed allegedly they get to the vendors

419
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
then the vendors do have to take time to

420
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,639
check them in they've got to inventory

421
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,719
count them then they've got to add them

422
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
to the website then you are able to

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
purchase them but keep in mind that

424
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
there are a lot of people trying to buy

425
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,679
seeds and a lot of these companies are

426
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,079
smaller than they do appear iriegenetics

427
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,078
is me uh 90 of the company is me i do

428
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,000
have a few helping hands occasionally uh

429
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,120
some small packing stuff and you guys

430
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,399
know that clint's helping out and

431
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
there's some stuff like that happening

432
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,919
but most of it is me so i'm overwhelmed

433
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
i'm overloaded i'm doing my best to get

434
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,879
the seeds to the vendors then they've

435
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,159
got to get them

436
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,759
they've probably got one person that

437
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,439
works for them that is receiving seeds

438
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,600
from multiple breeders they've got to

439
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
count all the packs in inventory them

440
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
put them on the website make sure

441
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,838
everything is legit there's a lot to

442
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
running a business in the back end that

443
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,519
we may not see so please be patient with

444
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
the vendors i did say that i'm

445
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,679
restocking uh when i said that you guys

446
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,599
went crazy started uh harassing

447
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,919
messaging the vendors i appreciate that

448
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,278
keep doing that but your ravenous hounds

449
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,958
give them a couple of minutes to get the

450
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,278
products checked in they'll put them on

451
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,599
the website we don't withhold product on

452
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,278
purpose we're in business to do business

453
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
we don't do any business by withholding

454
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,480
product so that's not how commerce would

455
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,639
work so we do want to get them out to

456
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
you just give us time understand that

457
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,680
some of the companies are not as big as

458
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,239
they look we do have a large presence

459
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,719
but they're small numbers of manpower

460
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
and women power and non-binary power in

461
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
a lot of these companies the future is

462
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,359
weird you gotta say a lot of weird [ __ ]

463
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,039
