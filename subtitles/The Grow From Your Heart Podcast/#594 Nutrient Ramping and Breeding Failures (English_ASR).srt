some plant stuff i do have one more

99
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
important topic to talk about it is

100
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,199
winter time

101
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,400
here in colorado it is cold as

102
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,839
well you know what i'm gonna say it's

103
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
cold as [ __ ] out here in colorado i was

104
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
gonna not even say it but

105
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,158
i'm just gonna say it's cold as [ __ ]

106
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
dude it is so cold today

107
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,399
uh i was walking across the kitchen and

108
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
my feet were freezing on the tile

109
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,519
had to get some socks and it made me

110
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
think of something

111
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
i need to tell you guys to get your

112
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
plants off of the floor

113
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,400
in the winter time it is never a good

114
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,158
idea to have your plants on the cold

115
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
ground on the cold floor

116
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,679
that ground is super cold my toes my

117
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,598
feet were cold and purple

118
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
i didn't like it i'm sure if you've got

119
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,639
plants on the floor

120
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
during the winter time they are not

121
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,359
happy with you they're not going to

122
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,039
drink as much as they should they're not

123
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
going to eat as much as they should

124
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,919
they won't cycle the way that they

125
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
should their metabolism won't function

126
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,719
the way that they should

127
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
you will see funky coloring you will see

128
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,519
nutrient issues

129
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
it will look like you've got a ph

130
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
problem you'll start getting purple

131
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
stems purple and goldish colored leaves

132
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,719
that is because your plants are simply

133
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
too damn

134
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,799
cold it may feel like the room is great

135
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
the relative humidity the temperature

136
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
may be just fine your

137
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
vpd may be dialed in but feel the

138
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,158
temperature of that floor put your bare

139
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
hand on the floor put your bare foot on

140
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,120
the floor

141
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
if you say [ __ ] that's cold your plants

142
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
have been sitting there all day and

143
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
haven't had a chance to move

144
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
and it was only colder during the dark

145
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,679
cycle so if it's cold during your

146
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
daytime cycle it is absolutely colder

147
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
during the night cycle

148
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,319
that light's not getting down there it's

149
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,439
not penetrating the canopy enough to

150
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,839
warm up the ground

151
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,639
so it is always a good idea to get your

152
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,399
plants up off of that cold floor

153
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,319
there are several ways to do it a very

154
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,679
common way is to just buy extra pots if

155
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,439
you're using a three gallon pot

156
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
get another three gallon pot flip it

157
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,918
upside down set your plant right on top

158
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,599
of there

159
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,959
you did just eat up about 10 to 12

160
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
inches of your floor space of your

161
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,680
ceiling height

162
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,879
but the plants are now off of the floor

163
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,439
they're not going to freeze

164
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,519
another common way to uh correct this to

165
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,120
remedy this is to just get a tray

166
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,279
a lot of people will buy the four by

167
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,918
four botanicare tray or the three by six

168
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,519
tray

169
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,439
build a little cinder block table lift

170
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,799
that up off the ground put a five gallon

171
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,240
bucket underneath it so you could drain

172
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
all your water into there pull the

173
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,519
bucket out dump that somehow

174
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,038
that is a great way to get the plants up

175
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,879
off the floor in a commercial

176
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,120
environment i definitely recommend

177
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,319
long sliding greenhouse tables those are

178
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
the way to go

179
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,159
do what fits your budget some people

180
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
simply use a pallet some people will

181
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
take a cinder block and put the plants

182
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,879
on a cinder block

183
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,478
whatever works for you will be great

184
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,000
that fits your budget

185
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,439
maybe it's not aesthetically pleasing

186
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
maybe you've got to go a little more

187
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,240
pricey just to keep the garden

188
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
up for appearances if that's what you're

189
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,478
into but my point is

190
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,000
get those plants up off the ground

191
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,758
you're pouring water into them they're

192
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,879
sitting on the cold concrete that water

193
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
gets super cold

194
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,759
your plants are getting pissed off if

195
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,359
you wouldn't want to put your hand your

196
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
feet or maybe even your balls in that

197
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,000
water

198
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,839
or on that floor don't do it to your

199
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
plants the plants can't go put on some

200
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,239
socks they can't the plants can't grab a

201
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
pair of shoes

202
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,199
the plants can't crank up the heat

203
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,159
they're [ __ ] they've got to deal with

204
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
what you give them

205
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
they're your responsibility keep your

206
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,758
baby's feet warm all right

207
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,879
where do we go from there let's talk

208
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
about a failed

209
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,560
breeding project i've got a great email

210
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
here in front of me this one came from

211
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,079
our friend

212
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,159
marco esquandolas ry ry

213
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,159
rocco the message says hey ross to jeff

214
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,039
i never miss a podcast and i really

215
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
appreciate it

216
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,360
hey i really appreciate you listening to

217
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
every podcast episode that does mean a

218
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
lot to me

219
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,279
it says i hope you do more strain

220
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,038
specific

221
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,399
episodes if you've been listening to the

222
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,918
show for a while you know that i do like

223
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,560
to highlight some of the strains that i

224
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,918
have bred

225
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,079
i've kind of taken a break from that

226
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,918
because i've got so much uh so many

227
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,199
patreon messages and so much listener

228
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,198
generated content

229
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
that it is more uh responsible of me to

230
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,879
answer your questions

231
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
than to simply advertise my brand and my

232
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,680
products i feel is more uh

233
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,519
more important for me to help you than

234
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,038
advertise my stuff if you've got a

235
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,879
question about a specific strain i will

236
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,240
do a strain report on it but

237
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,759
i've held off on those for a minute i've

238
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,079
got a couple written i just need to

239
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
throw them out let me stay focused

240
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,918
this one says it would also be really

241
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
cool to hear about one of your breeding

242
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,159
experiments that did not work

243
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,960
very well for instance i reversed a

244
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
leonardo

245
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,719
and i crossed a bunch of your strains

246
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,679
but the resulting crosses were no better

247
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,000
than the parents

248
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
so that's not successful that is a very

249
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
good point

250
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
when you were breeding you do need to

251
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
have a goal you need to have some

252
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
standards

253
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,439
the idea is to improve upon canada's

254
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
cannabis when we are breeding we don't

255
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,759
want to just

256
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,439
make seeds just to make seeds we don't

257
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
want to make more reproduction [ __ ] we

258
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,160
want to make

259
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,680
winners if you got two sixes you better

260
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
make a seven or an eight out of that if

261
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,079
you got two sixes i hope you can make a

262
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,839
12.

263
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,240
just not how things work all the time

264
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,359
let me stay focused it goes on to say

265
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
the orange gasm to leo was strong stable

266
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
and frosty

267
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
so a great gift for first time growers

268
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,239
but once the growers get

269
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,279
serious we will get them more irie

270
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
originals

271
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,439
uh be well and best wishes feel free to

272
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
use my and then he says my name

273
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,038
uh i'm just going to call you marco s

274
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
gwandolas because i like that

275
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,439
shout out to my buddy marco escondolas

276
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,839
run like an antelope my friend

277
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,279
let's talk about some failed breeding

278
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,038
projects

279
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,038
i've been breeding for a long time and

280
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,639
i've put out there are probably 50

281
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,120
strains on my website right now there's

282
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
probably closer to 75 or 100 strains

283
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,399
that you can read about that i have

284
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
created that i have released there on my

285
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,839
website

286
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,159
i've done a lot of work that being said

287
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,198
if there are 75 on the website

288
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
there are probably another 25 to 50 that

289
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
i never

290
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,918
even released there are probably 10 or

291
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,120
15 that i threw

292
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,359
large batches of seeds away because

293
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
oh excuse me i'm gonna do i edit that or

294
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,598
not probably not let's take a drink and

295
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
keep moving

296
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,360
there are large batches of seeds that i

297
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,198
threw away because i did not feel like

298
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
those plants those seeds that breeding

299
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,598
project lived up to my expectations

300
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,200
and it did not improve upon cannabis it

301
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,038
didn't move cannabis forward

302
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
if that was a genetic dice roll i went

303
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,038
backwards three steps

304
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
i wasn't happy with outcome i took plant

305
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,278
a and plant b and like

306
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
i said before maybe they were both

307
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,158
sevens or eights i wanted to make nines

308
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
and tens

309
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,360
i came out with more sixes and sevens

310
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,879
and that's not acceptable so i have

311
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,039
thrown [ __ ] away

312
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,399
let's talk about some of those projects

313
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,039
i have talked about

314
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,159
the lemon og project that i worked with

315
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,159
let me take a sip of this water

316
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
all right we'll keep going now i got a

317
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,759
clone of a lemon og

318
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,399
plant and i love that plant it tasted

319
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,879
amazing

320
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,720
it had a really nice balanced buzz to it

321
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,679
it grew very well i never had a problem

322
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,759
with it in the garden

323
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,439
i never got mites and never got mildew

324
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,799
it would clone very easily

325
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
you could top it it would make a bunch

326
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,240
of branches you could leave it untopped

327
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
it'd grow a big old giant glory bud

328
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
that was a great [ __ ] plan i thought

329
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,000
it would be amazing

330
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
to breed to it so i had a male i don't

331
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,559
remember which male i used at that time

332
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,480
i reversed it i reversed the lemon kush

333
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,278
uh the lemon og kush got reversed is

334
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,879
what i did

335
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,320
and i pollinated a bunch of [ __ ] with

336
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,919
that lemon kush and

337
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
everything that came from there was

338
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,759
complete garbage

339
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
it was not good at all some of the

340
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,958
plants would grow

341
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,958
with great vigor they would put on a

342
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,838
bunch of weight big fat buds but then

343
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,199
when you smoke it

344
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,120
there was zero absolute zero buzz

345
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,879
came from any of the offspring from that

346
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
lemon og breeding project

347
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,480
i think i pollinated two or three

348
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
different plants we grew them out

349
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
we smoked them and everybody went that

350
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,879
tastes good and it smells good but

351
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,720
i'm not high at all so in my opinion

352
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,320
that was a failed breeding project of

353
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
course we didn't take it to a lab

354
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,399
there could have been cbd in there there

355
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,000
could have been uh cb

356
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,480
thcv cbg there could have been a lot of

357
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,078
other

358
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,759
cannabinoids it wasn't giving us the

359
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,679
head buzz that we were looking for

360
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,360
the familiar stone feeling you get when

361
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,919
you smoke weed we weren't getting any of

362
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
that

363
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,559
it was kind of like making you wish you

364
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,839
would have gotten stoned because it was

365
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,518
like smoking weed light

366
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,959
you'd smoke and just go well my lungs

367
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
burn and i coughed and there's a roach

368
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,479
and there's smoke in the air but

369
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,559
i don't feel [ __ ] from that so that was

370
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
a failed breeding project in my opinion

371
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,159
we aren't machines uh nobody was looking

372
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,439
for cbd

373
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,919
uh cbg thcv we wanted to get high so

374
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
in my opinion that was a failed breeding

375
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,719
experiment it didn't make cannabis go

376
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,439
forward

377
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,879
um i think and you're gonna a lot of

378
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
people are gonna have a varying opinion

379
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,039
i think nightmares kind of sucked

380
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,599
i released nightmares we ran it we

381
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,078
tested it it did a great job in testing

382
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,200
um then i saw later on down the line

383
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,359
that it wasn't

384
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,278
i was seeing other phenotypes and other

385
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
uh plant structures that i didn't see

386
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,639
in testing i guess we didn't test enough

387
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
maybe uh new

388
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,759
environments gave us new things but

389
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,200
that's when i really started testing a

390
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,480
little bit harder was when i saw that

391
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
night nurse

392
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,759
wasn't what i thought it was she was

393
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,559
cool for me she was cool in a couple of

394
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,000
local grows

395
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,759
she kicked ass in a commercial grove

396
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
when i saw her go to other uh

397
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
smaller grows it was when she went under

398
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
leds and ceramic metal halides the night

399
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,360
nurse just it wasn't a good plant

400
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
in my opinion i should not have put that

401
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,159
one out i have discontinued i'll never

402
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,759
make more of that

403
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,199
i think i gave the last bit of seeds

404
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,720
away just to have them uh

405
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
gone and people know what they've got

406
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
like told them that plant's kind of

407
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
problematic it's not the best and they

408
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,160
said i want that it's got my attention

409
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,759
so they've got it in my opinion that was

410
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,199
not one of the best

411
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,319
um i made king kim grape stomper

412
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,040
f2s and they were [ __ ] wild

413
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
there was no uniformity in there if you

414
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,838
grew 10 seeds

415
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,159
you got 10 different plants out of that

416
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,720
batch of seeds so that that was a failed

417
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,399
experiment in my opinion i wanted to

418
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
lock in certain traits of the king kim

419
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
grape stomper og

420
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,639
and i did not i unleashed the beast i

421
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
[ __ ] unlocked something to where

422
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
every single phenotype was wildly vastly

423
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
different

424
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,958
uh there were tall skinny plants in

425
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
there there were tall fat plants in

426
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,078
there there were short skinny plants

427
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
there were short fat plants

428
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,519
there were sativa crazy sativa looking

429
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,159
plants in that mix there were heavy

430
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,159
heavy

431
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,399
indica plants in that mix i don't know

432
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,240
what i did it wasn't what i wanted

433
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,600
sometimes you expect that nf2 you will

434
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,159
expect uh

435
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,079
variety wild variation you'll also see

436
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,240
in an f2 you will see where

437
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,519
they strongly outperform the parents you

438
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
get a lot of improved

439
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
traits from those but they don't have

440
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
the vigor they may have the potency you

441
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,759
may see different phenotypes but they

442
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,000
start losing that vigor

443
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,919
so f2 showed a lot of wild traits that i

444
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
was not prepared for i abandoned that

445
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,399
project i did not move forward with it

446
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
i thought that was a [ __ ] mess i gave

447
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,839
that up

448
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,799
um where else are we gonna talk about

449
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,240
testing

450
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,639
uh oh platinum og i bred the grateful

451
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
dog

452
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,799
to platinum og uh the seeds were big and

453
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
fat they were stout

454
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,639
everything looked healthy everything was

455
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
fine none of the seeds would germinate

456
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,799
so that was a failure in my opinion

457
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,919
other seeds that came from that same

458
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,759
round of breeding

459
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,958
all germinated just fine they all grew

460
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,958
with great vigor

461
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,919
they harvested well they went to market

462
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,359
they went on the website and got

463
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,159
advertised and sold

464
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
but that platinum uh the platinum og too

465
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,439
grateful dog

466
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
was terrible that never germinated i did

467
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,560
not get one sprout out of the entire

468
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
batch of seeds

469
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,039
so in my opinion that was a major

470
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,560
failure that whole plant worth of seeds

471
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,360
[ __ ] nothing happened um breeding to

472
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,078
the mac

473
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
sometimes can be not a hundred percent

474
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,919
failure but not

475
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
a great success when i pollinate the mac

476
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,559
i've pollinated the mac with a couple of

477
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,760
different things

478
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,679
i get very very minimal minimal seeds

479
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,039
from the mac pollination if i hit it

480
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,559
within a rise male

481
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,319
if i hit it with king solomon at just

482
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,719
the right time i can get some seeds out

483
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
of her

484
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
i've gotten 25 seeds in one harvest

485
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,599
that's the best i've done

486
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,639
the first time i tried i got six not

487
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,120
60 not 600 not 6000 but

488
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,000
six the plant next to it gave me about 2

489
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,198
000 seeds

490
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,799
the mac plant i got six so

491
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,599
in my opinion breeding with the mac

492
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,519
sometimes is not the best success

493
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
kind of a failure but the offspring that

494
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,159
come from those good seeds are amazing

495
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,958
so i don't know that that is a complete

496
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,159
failure

497
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,638
um a long time ago i reversed golden

498
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,278
goat

499
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,198
and pollinated a headband cut with the

500
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,759
reversed golden goat pollen

501
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,359
i don't know what happened that headband

502
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,759
plant that received the pollen

503
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
shriveled and died within two days other

504
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,600
plants in the room

505
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,278
were successful those seeds made it to

506
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,079
fruition i've grown the seeds i've sold

507
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,240
the seeds

508
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,359
for some reason that headband plant was

509
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,959
like [ __ ] you

510
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
i'm not taking your pollen it just

511
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,719
shriveled up and it died i've never seen

512
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,399
it i've never had that happen before

513
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
and i didn't try it again i figured that

514
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,958
that was a one-time thing and if it did

515
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,399
that to me

516
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,479
i wasn't going to waste my opportunity

517
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
or my time or my plans or my money or my

518
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
space trying that project again i let

519
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,120
that one go i do have more notes let me

520
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
keep myself

521
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,959
on track here some reversals completely

522
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
suck

523
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,799
sometimes trying to reverse plants is a

524
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
pain in the ass some plants don't

525
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,838
reverse well

526
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
i've talked about reversing that is when

527
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,839
i treat a female plant

528
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,838
with a product that i make myself i make

529
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,720
my own silver thiosulfate i apply that

530
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,839
to a plant

531
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
in very specific intervals durations

532
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,040
and dilutions i think those are the

533
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,240
words i'm looking for and

534
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,958
most of the time i can create a

535
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,799
female plant that will produce pollen

536
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,919
sacs and those pollen sacs are feminized

537
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,479
and i can use that to make

538
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,879
uh female seeds however sometimes those

539
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
reversals don't make much pollen if any

540
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,838
pollen

541
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
at all you've got to learn the female

542
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
plant

543
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,600
when you start spraying a female plant

544
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
it'll react in different ways

545
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,040
so i will get multiple clones of the

546
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,360
same plant and treat them with different

547
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,599
sprays and find out what works the best

548
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,199
but sometimes i can't get those plants

549
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
to reverse properly some plants just

550
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,599
don't want to reverse

551
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,959
sometimes they're stubborn they don't

552
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,159
give you a lot of they're real stingy

553
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,799
they don't give you a lot of a lot of

554
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,278
pollen

555
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,240
so sometimes the reversals are a pain in

556
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,120
the ass

557
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
uh testing is really where i try to find

558
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,799
all of those

559
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
issues i try to i grow them myself most

560
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,519
of the time i'm being honest with you

561
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,439
right now the jack the rippers

562
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,278
uh the jack the ripper blueberry cookies

563
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,399
i'm letting tanasi get the very first

564
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,679
testers out of those

565
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
i don't have room i don't have time i

566
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,198
don't have space i want to get them out

567
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
you guys are testing those for me i've

568
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,198
got great faith in those

569
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
uh they went to close friends and family

570
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,159
before they went out

571
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
so they got one round of testing they've

572
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,759
passed that round of testing they're

573
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,440
going out to the public testers now

574
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,278
once i know that the public is good with

575
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,639
those then i will put them out but the

576
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,439
testing is what

577
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
really reveals the uh the success or

578
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,959
failure rate

579
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,600
in a breeding project so if i can grow

580
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,439
it

581
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
that's cool like i said the night nurse

582
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
i knew the male plant i knew the female

583
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,519
plant

584
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,040
i knew what to expect from that plant

585
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
the close group they could grow it

586
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,918
really well when it got out to other

587
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,919
lighting and other environments

588
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,759
that wasn't as stellar as i expected so

589
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
the testing would have revealed that if

590
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,919
we had done more testing on it which is

591
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,679
in turn caused me to step up my testing

592
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,360
eye test much more thoroughly now

593
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
i've evolved a lot as a grower as a

594
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,399
breeder as a business person so

595
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,318
um that is my brief rant on failed

596
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,759
breeding projects i have had a lot of

597
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,678
success but for every

598
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
successful breeding project there was

599
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,519
some sort of failure behind it that

600
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,959
inspired me to do better taught me how

601
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,558
to do things more correctly

602
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
just move me forward so learn from your

603
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,359
mistakes there are always going to be

604
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
failures in breeding

605
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,558
uh breeding is kind of like a it's a

606
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,679
crapshoot it's a dice roll

607
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,279
you're putting a bunch of pieces

608
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,840
together and hoping that they land

609
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,038
together

610
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,319
you've got the ingredients here you've

611
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,919
got the ingredients here but you don't

612
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,439
get to pick exactly

613
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
how much of each ingredient goes into

614
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,400
the mix so you've got to hope for the

615
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
best and sometimes

616
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
we create a big bag of [ __ ] and then

617
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
it's our responsibility as a breeder to

618
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,519
throw that [ __ ] away

619
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
flush it down the toilet feed it to the

620
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,798
birds maybe sprout the sprouts and eat

621
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,279
the sprouts if you're into that sort of

622
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,200
thing

623
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,798
but they are not meant to be put in

624
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,798
anybody's cannabis garden

625
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,400
get rid of those set yourself and your

626
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,119
fellow growers up for

627
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
success all right marco esquandolas i

628
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,359
feel like i answered that

629
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
question that was a fun one thank you

630
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,479
for getting me ranting on that i do

631
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
enjoy breeding and talking about

632
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,079
breeding so that was a lot of fun

633
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,519
i've got one more message here let's not

634
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,678
waste a lot of time let's jump right

635
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,240
into this one this one comes from

636
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
jason j in northern california and it

637
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,759
goes like this

638
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,279
hey rasta jeff i've been growing for

639
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,079
years and have great success

640
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,279
now with cocoa i auto water five times a

641
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,240
day in arrow pots

642
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,480
from a 30 gallon res i do not flush

643
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
weekly and this new system cranks

644
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,599
so that is a reference to another

645
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,200
episode when we were talking about

646
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,279
weekly flushing

647
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
this listener does not flush on a weekly

648
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,279
basis in coco

649
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,240
and let's see did they say it cranks yes

650
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,879
their system

651
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,359
cranks it says like you said if you

652
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
flush

653
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,959
they miss a feed and when you're in

654
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
cocoa they want every feeding that you

655
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,279
give them so you don't want to flush and

656
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
miss a feed

657
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,839
uh it says if you do flush just flush

658
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
the pot by hand

659
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,399
don't drain the res and do all that mess

660
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,080
i can flush a plant and not even

661
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
interrupt its feeding schedule

662
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,319
i'm confused why people have trouble

663
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,359
with flushing or even do it at all mid

664
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,439
grow i don't know why people flush mid

665
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,439
grow i see people on social media say

666
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,600
ah i'm about to switch from veg to

667
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,679
flower how hard should i flush

668
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,279
or it's the end of my normal feeding

669
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,440
week i'm going to flush

670
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
that's unnecessary you are stopping the

671
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,120
plants from eating

672
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
one solid meal you only get so many

673
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,839
feedings for these plants

674
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,319
if you go if they're nine weeks that's

675
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,678
63 days if you feed them every day that

676
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,439
is 63 feedings

677
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,519
if you flush them once a week that is

678
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
nine feedings they did not get

679
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,279
that's a percentage i don't do the math

680
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,879
there for me i'm not focused on that

681
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,720
that's a percentage of feedings that you

682
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
did not get that is performance lost

683
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,319
from your plants

684
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,200
so don't flush unnecessarily don't flush

685
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,639
excessively

686
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
if you didn't [ __ ] anything up there's

687
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
nothing to flush out now it says my

688
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,759
question

689
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,759
is i'm learning more about pk spiking

690
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,679
and calcium ramping in flour

691
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,879
i'm confident enough to know to try

692
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120
these techniques but i could use a

693
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,440
little guidance on when to spike pk

694
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,279
and so on when should i start spiking my

695
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,759
pk if i choose to do so

696
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,798
and you guys pk is phosphorus and

697
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,200
potassium

698
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,119
i will say npk a lot in the future i

699
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,519
mean nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

700
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,119
so pk is phosphorus and potassium

701
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,319
or is it potassium and phosphorus i

702
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,519
think i was right the first time never

703
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,879
second guess yourself

704
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,480
uh it says i've heard this talked about

705
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
much on any i have not heard this talked

706
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,839
about on any podcast

707
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,119
so i hope you can help me i also want to

708
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,678
try some soluble

709
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,359
homemade calcium inputs char some egg

710
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,559
shells to their carbon form dissolve in

711
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,798
vinegar and eventually

712
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,240
you have calcium phosphate basically

713
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,000
there's a little more to it now i'm

714
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
rambling yes you are my friend but it

715
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,558
says i love what you do brother and keep

716
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,759
it up

717
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,279
from jason j in northern colorado did i

718
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,319
say california the first time i think i

719
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,599
misread that and said

720
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,038
uh our buddy jay is in northern colorado

721
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,879
shout out to my buddies up north i hope

722
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,319
you are warm because it's freaking cold

723
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
and snowy today you're probably getting

724
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,158
beat up up there

725
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,480
so the question here is about ramping up

726
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,440
and increasing phosphorus and potassium

727
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,400
later in flour and why would somebody

728
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,159
want to do that

729
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,919
as the flowering cycle goes on our

730
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,440
plants don't want as much nitrogen too

731
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
much nitrogen and flour will make your

732
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,159
plants grow stretchy

733
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,038
they won't get the bud set you're hoping

734
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,440
for so we want to taper off the nitrogen

735
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,200
in turn we want to increase phosphorus

736
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
and potassium that is what builds fat

737
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
buds

738
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
that's what gives us big strong plants

739
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,919
so our listener

740
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,319
our friend jason is asking when do i do

741
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,120
this

742
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,399
increase when do i start this don't do

743
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,479
anything too extreme

744
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,000
always kind of ramp up slowly don't go

745
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,440
from like

746
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,038
so many ppms or ec of phosphorus and

747
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
potassium don't double it the next day

748
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,200
just taper your way up slowly elevate

749
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,119
uh work your way up until you see that

750
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,319
the plants are showing you that they've

751
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,599
had enough the way to see that they're

752
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,439
getting enough nutrients

753
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,279
is to look for what i call the nails

754
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
getting done the tips of the leaves will

755
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,599
look just like they went to the

756
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
manicurist and got their fingernails

757
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,678
painted

758
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
see a little leaf burn a little leaf

759
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,280
burn little tips

760
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
little burns on the leaf tips damn that

761
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,759
was a lot of words my brain wouldn't put

762
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
into a sentence

763
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,279
little burns on the leaf tips that look

764
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,280
like the fingernails got done

765
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,038
are the first signs that you are pushing

766
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,918
that plant a little bit too hard with

767
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,079
nutrients

768
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,360
when you see that you can either stick

769
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,319
with the amount of nutrients you were

770
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,759
giving the plant

771
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,439
because you're not roasting it you're

772
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,798
not toasting it you're pushing it right

773
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,600
to the stressful point

774
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,519
or you can dial back just a little bit i

775
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,319
myself i like to see just a touch of

776
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,158
newt burn

777
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,480
i want to push them right to the limit

778
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,960
until i see that little itty bitty sign

779
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
of hey

780
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,759
that's a little bit too much when they

781
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
say hey that's a little bit too much i

782
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,000
say

783
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,519
well you're taking it so let's just keep

784
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,038
giving it to you and i give it to them

785
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,918
at that strength until the end

786
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,480
so taper up slowly but let's talk about

787
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,520
when

788
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,480
to do it increase p and k slowly

789
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,000
over weeks three through seven if you're

790
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,000
going to harvest a week nine you want to

791
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,038
start flushing at the end of week seven

792
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,839
so slowly ramp it up start at week three

793
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,599
slowly ramp up until week seven maybe

794
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,759
max out at week six and keep going at

795
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,918
week six maybe max out of week five

796
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,759
but see what those plants want have a

797
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,038
goal have a strategy don't just think

798
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,599
you're gonna go in there and increase

799
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,038
things and

800
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,558
the plants are gonna get bigger when you

801
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,599
start increasing your phosphorus and

802
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,678
potassium

803
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,038
you may also throw your calmag out of

804
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,480
whack so you may need to

805
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,558
gently increase the calcium and

806
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,319
magnesium as well

807
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,000
is it the phosphorous or the potassium

808
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,119
let's see potassium

809
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,240
and calmag will mess with each other if

810
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,000
you give one

811
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,839
too much calcium it'll mess up your

812
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,599
phosphorus uptake or your potassium

813
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,000
uptake if you give too much potassium

814
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,000
it will mess with your calmag uptake so

815
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,240
pay attention to those ratios

816
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,278
so slowly increase nutrients over weeks

817
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
three through seven

818
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,880
and then right before you flush hit them

819
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,879
with that winter frost one time

820
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,919
that'll give you that last big fat dose

821
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
of npk

822
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,278
and that should give you a big fat

823
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
harvest but like i keep saying don't

824
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,640
boost them too hard

825
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
right away because you will burn them so

826
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,919
watch the leaf tips for info the leaf

827
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
tips will tell you everything you need

828
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
to know

829
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,840
if they start getting crispy then

830
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,519
they're getting burned if you start

831
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,678
seeing yellow splotches in the middle

832
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,558
you may be overdoing it with the calcium

833
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
if you see

834
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,038
little camouflage looking patterns up

835
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,480
here you may be under doing the calcium

836
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,679
so pay attention to the leaves

837
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,759
they will give you all of the

838
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,600
information that you need now here is

839
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,558
something very important

840
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,000
write down everything that you do write

841
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,558
down either your ec

842
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
or your ppms of your feeding solution

843
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,079
you are changing things

844
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
this is a time to take notes if this

845
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,359
goes well you're going to want to

846
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
remember exactly what you did

847
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,399
if this goes terribly wrong you're going

848
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,959
to want to remember

849
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,679
exactly what you did so take a lot of

850
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,519
notes

851
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,720
write down it week 3 day 23 i added this

852
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,679
much npk

853
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,079
at this ec or this ppm write down how

854
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,038
many how many milliliters of each bottle

855
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,879
you used

856
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,158
like i said this could go beautifully or

857
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,159
this could go terribly

858
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,520
you want documentation and if it goes

859
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,760
perfectly you're going to want to repeat

860
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,119
it

861
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,720
so if you've got the notes written down

862
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,000
you've got repeatable results you could

863
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,960
just follow that recipe

864
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,440
do it all over again i keep saying this

865
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,440
the

866
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,038
most important part is to watch the

867
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,038
plants for feedback

868
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,798
feed them watch them you're in cocoa

869
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,440
you're going to get a reaction within 48

870
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,038
hours

871
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
you will know if those plants are happy

872
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,558
or angry with you very quickly

873
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
also test your runoff if those plants

874
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,519
are giving you

875
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,479
real high runoff numbers or real low

876
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,240
runoff numbers

877
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,679
and you can see if they are or are not

878
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,798
responding to the feedings you can

879
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
adjust from there

880
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,079
if they're giving you real high runoffs

881
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,558
that means you've got too much nutrients

882
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,000
in there

883
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,359
if they're giving you real low runoff

884
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,319
numbers you may be able to feed a little

885
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,558
bit higher

886
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,158
all right where are we from there you

887
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,918
talked about the

888
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,278
um oh this is going to be very strain

889
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,679
and very plant dependent

890
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,278
so you have to watch each plant i know

891
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
that golden goat crosses

892
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,038
you can npk the [ __ ] out of them at the

893
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,720
end but if you feed

894
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,679
the uh i'm not even going to mention

895
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
that plant there was a plant in a

896
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,919
commercial grow

897
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,278
that if we fed it too much at the end it

898
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,200
would just go crazy it wouldn't even

899
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,880
grow it would start growing in a circle

900
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,640
instead of growing one big bud it would

901
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
just start putting little popcorn buds

902
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
in a spiral up the stem that plants suck

903
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,000
to grow

904
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,918
so that's all about the plants it is all

905
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,159
very strain specific but

906
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,240
slowly start increasing your phosphorus

907
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,799
and potassium around week three

908
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
slowly build that up until week seven

909
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,798
then hit it with the

910
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,278
winter frost then start flushing from

911
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,119
there

912
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,558
and you should have excellent results

913
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,839
pay attention to the plants take a lot

914
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,440
of notes remember

915
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,439
the meters are great the toys are great

916
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,120
but the plants are always the boss

917
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
now for that organic part of your

918
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,798
question you said char up some eggshells

919
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
to their carbon form dissolve them in

920
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
vinegar

921
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,240
and basically you have calcium phosphate

922
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440
that is not my area of expertise i'm not

923
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,079
going to act like i know

924
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,798
anything about that i am a bottled salt

925
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,519
grower

926
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,519
um this is not my realm i invite you to

927
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,319
join us on embracing organics and we can

928
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,798
talk about

929
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,319
making your calcium supplement from your

930
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,759
vinegar and eggshells

931
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,759
that is the appropriate place for that

932
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,519
conversation not to blow you off but i'm

933

934
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,679
area

935
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,919

980
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,359
talking into a microphone with no video

981
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,159
and here we are 4k video lighting lights

982
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,319
behind me

983
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600

might be a sign of mental illness if i

988
