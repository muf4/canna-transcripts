questions portion part of this podcast I

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,000
do have a great question here right in

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,978
front of me this one came from the irie

37

giveaway is sponsored by our friends at

46
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,780
seeds here now.com so this first

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,000
question from The Grow help tab came

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,118
from our friend Brent and it goes a

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,859
little bit like this it says hey Ross to

50
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,659
Jeff I love your work and I love every

51
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,978
single episode you have put out well

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,079
thanks a lot that's a great compliment

53
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,879
and a good way to start an email it says

54
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,098
I can't thank you enough for what I have

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,659
learned from you that is a huge

56
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,979
compliment thank you for mentioning that

57
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,719
you've learned a lot from me thank you

58
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,399
for saying that and that is all of the

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,199
thanks I need what I would really like

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,580
is that you just go in the garden and

61
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,619
kick ass and it sounds like you're doing

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,480
that so that is the best way to reward

63
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,700
me or the patreon campaign of course

64
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,500
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

65
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,359
heart but letters like this messages

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,340
like this and knowing that your garden

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
is better is all the thanks and reward

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,420
that I do need but thank you for the

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,700
compliments let's keep going it says my

70
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,799
question is this

71
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,238
what sort of growth characteristics can

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
you expect to see when you have the same

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,519
plant one has a Taproot started from

74
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,378
seed and one is a plant started from a

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,180
clone is it basically Vigor and

76
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,459
structure that will differ thank you for

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,319
your time buddy much love from Michigan

78
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,459
big shout out to my buddy Brent in

79
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,619
Michigan thank you for the great

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,479
question I do have a good answer for

81
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,860
this one so they're asking when we grow

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,238
a plant the first time we grow it

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,519
obviously the first time a plant has

84
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,378
grown every plant comes from a seed it

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,140
all starts from a seed the first run is

86
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,518
always from seed then from then we've if

87
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,958
we want to repeat that plant and grow

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,000
that plant over again it's got to be

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
grown from a clone we have to clone it

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,539
reproduce that plant keep that clone

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,819
alive make more Cuts keep growing the

92
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,219
same thing the question is will we see

93
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,439
differences in growing that plant from a

94
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,658
seed versus growing it from a clone

95
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,459
which is a great question when we grow

96
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,799
it from a seed we do get what is called

97
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,479
a Tap Root that plant develops that

98
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,519
original Taproot which is supposed to be

99
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,199
that original source of life for that

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,539
plant to dig into the dirt dig into the

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,098
roots establish itself it gets nice and

102
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,900
thick and it shoots straight down most

103
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,759
of the time the Taproot tries to go down

104
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,080
with the cannabis plant it wants to go

105
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,939
down and then they start spreading out

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
once they've gone down far enough but

107
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,280
that Taproot is the main difference in

108
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,780
the Clone and the seed or origin plan

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,818
that is going to be the main difference

110
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,799
that does give us a little bit of more

111
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,298
Vigor sometimes you'll see if you plan

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,340
to clone and plant a seed at the same

113
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,840
time of the same plant that seed will

114
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,700
have a little bit more Vigor that is the

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,799
hybrid Vigor that's that fresh life just

116
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,060
trying to express itself so the main

117
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,819
difference you're going to see will

118
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,019
indeed be that that Taproot is going to

119
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,878
be your main difference other things

120
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,280
you're going to see are possibly

121
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,379
structure and pattern and this does

122
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,698
depend on a couple of things you'll

123
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,040
notice when you grow a cannabis plant

124
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,780
that main apical dominant top is

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,819
symmetrical it'll have branches coming

126
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,319
off the left and the right and then I

127
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,659
think the easiest way to say it is North

128
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,099
East and then Southwest and then north

129
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,139
and south and then east and west and

130
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,879
north and south and east and west is the

131
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,620
way that the nodes will face that's when

132
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,180
you cut the clones from the apical

133
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,620
meristem part of the plant if you cut

134
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,418
the clones from other branches of the

135
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,399
plant you may notice that those clones

136
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,620
that those branches May alternate where

137
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,120
the nodes shoot out it may just go north

138
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,220
and south north and south north and

139
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,899
south it won't go north south east west

140
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,639
north south or what am I doing you know

141
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,379
what I mean it won't do all four quality

142
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,540
the plus sign it'll just do a minus sign

143
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,459
shooting nodes on opposite sides instead

144
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,780
of all four directions that is going to

145
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,879
be one of the differences that you do

146
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,319
see also this is going to relate to

147
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,360
another question that's coming up on the

148
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,680
podcast that I've previewed sometimes

149
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,479
that clone

150
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,879
sometimes the seated plant will express

151
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,639
some weird mutation some weird funky

152
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,978
growth in some cases I have seen the

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,319
Clone not do the weird [ __ ] that the

154
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,360
seed plant originally did and that's

155
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,740
hard to say if it was the plant doing

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
something different or maybe it was

157
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,060
environmental maybe I put the seedling

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,860
into soil that was too rich maybe I gave

159
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,538
it too much light maybe I over watered

160
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,280
it and something went weird there and

161
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,560
that plant got usually it's a mutation

162
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,939
like a twisty leaf or just something a

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,459
weird structure a weird shape something

164
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,079
like that a weird reaction sometimes I

165
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,939
don't see that if I cut a clone and run

166
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,560
the Clone again sometimes some of the

167
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,300
plants don't show me that weird [ __ ] I

168
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,160
feel like it grows out or like I said

169
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,020
possibly it was something I did to it

170
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,820
the first time so sometimes we see

171
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,439
differences in the entire performance of

172
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,759
the plant when it comes from that

173
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,199
cologne but that's just when I do run

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,879
the anomalies if the plant's good enough

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,860
to get a clone from and I do decide to

176
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,418
run it again sometimes I have seen that

177
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,759
those weirdos grow out of their weird

178
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,079
[ __ ] in the second and third run let me

179
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,819
see if there's more to this message make

180
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,319
sure I cover everything

181
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,120
um yes the main difference is going to

182
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,219
be that caproot you'll see a difference

183
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,780
in the Vigor then we may see a

184
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,460
difference in the structure and shape

185
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,559
and the pattern of the plant and that

186
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,299
all depends on where you cut it from if

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,918
you cut it from that apical meristem you

188
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,478
may get the all four Direction nodes if

189
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,099
you cut it from a side branch you're

190
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,439
just going to get the two branches

191
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,840
coming from the sides the seed plant

192
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,160
you'll notice is much more symmetrical

193
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,379
the seed plant wants to grow with

194
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,900
symmetry I do have some plants to make

195
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,699
two tops just naturally on their own but

196
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,739
that's also symmetrical you'll notice

197
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,060
that from a seed plant all right my

198
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,500
friend Brent I do want to thank you for

199

giveaway is sponsored by my friends at

242
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,900
seeds here now.com the question goes

243
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,478
just like this it says Dear Ross to Jeff

244
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,279
big salute key doing what you do bro I'm

245
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,959
going to keep doing it can't stop won't

246
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,598
stop made it this far no reason to quit

247
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,579
now it says I'm finally trying some irie

248
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,378
gear congratulations bro welcome to the

249
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,959
team it says I've got two gorilla goat

250
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,099
sprouts and two lemon Jeffries that's a

251
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,378
great combination they're going to work

252
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,360
very well together they're going to both

253
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,280
grow quite tall but they're both going

254
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,259
to make very unique and different Aromas

255
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,958
the uh the Gorilla Glue is going to have

256
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,580
more like a sweet or the gorilla goat is

257
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,859
going to have a more sweet Gorilla Glue

258
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,479
flavor and that lemon Jeffrey is just

259
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,740
straight pure lemons so they're going to

260
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,538
grow well together but you're gonna have

261
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,580
a nice variety when the Harvest comes so

262
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:47,159
that's a beautiful setup it goes on it

263
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,420
says I work in a commercial grow welcome

264
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,240
to the team bro

265
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,620
then it says we have two sets of 12 12

266
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,879
rooms

267
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,940
um okay that makes sense we have a

268
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,240
daytime room running 11 P.M to am and a

269
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,040
nighttime room running 11 A.M to 11 p.m

270
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,799
is that right day and night time anyway

271
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,419
we've got 11 11 and 11 11 as their

272
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,419
schedules so they can divide the day

273
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:11,639
into half and have two 12-12 rooms it

274
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,099
says why would we do this is there any

275
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,379
reason other than night shift and

276
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,879
possibly saving on electricity I can't

277
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,860
understand why they don't put all of the

278
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,600
lights on during the day and you can

279
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,120
only get into each room for half of the

280
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,519
day as it stands so help me figure this

281
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,959
out so the situation is our dude has a

282
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,759
commercial grow space works at a

283
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,859
commercial growth space and it's cut in

284
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,319
half and they run one half of the

285
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,539
flowering room on 12 12 from 11 A.M to

286
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,100
11 p.m and when that turns off then they

287
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,778
allocate that electricity to the other

288
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,540
side of the room so that it can be on

289
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:44,399
from 11 pm to 11 A.M I could understand

290
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,159
seriously how this would be frustrating

291
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
trying to schedule a workflow employees

292
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,480
don't want to be anywhere at 11 pm they

293
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,100
should be at home in bed sleeping and

294
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,080
then for the transition to happen at 11

295
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,480
that means that you've got to come in at

296
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,920
like eight o'clock and get you get three

297
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,300
hours in that one room and then the

298
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,219
lights go off and shift into the other

299
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,659
room and then you get whatever they're

300
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,120
on all day but you only have so many

301
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,919
hours left to work so it's probably hard

302
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,060
a pain in the ass to schedule working in

303
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,500
there you probably got to come in at six

304
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,838
or seven in the morning to get [ __ ] done

305
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,000
and the 11 the nighttime room so I

306
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,279
understand why that's frustrating this

307
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,980
uh question is all about why do I think

308
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,778
they're doing this my main assumption

309
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,420
for why they are doing this is to save

310
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:27,000
on electricity they probably possibly

311
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,699
likely I'm assuming do not have enough

312
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,639
electrical power to run the entire side

313
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,320
the entire room all at one time uh it's

314
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,000
probably less load on the the

315
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,620
Transformers whatever is bringing in the

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,879
electricity I don't know what where

317
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,860
you're sourcing your power if you've got

318
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,379
three phase power I hope you're doing a

319
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,240
big commercial facility but maybe not so

320
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,500
maybe it's a power limitation maybe they

321
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,299
can't run it all because of the

322
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,100
electricity maybe they don't have enough

323
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,078
of air conditioning to cool that many

324
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,700
lights all at one time and it's easier

325
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,699
just to cool it down only running half

326
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,560
of it also you did State one thing

327
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,778
kilowatt hours are much cheaper during

328
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,239
off-peak hours which means they charge

329
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,980
more for electricity during the day the

330
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,839
time when everybody's at work when we're

331
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,539
all up watching TV running our coffee

332
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,339
makers running the TV running the grow

333
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,958
lights on our own houses but at the

334
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,820
office they got all the lights on at the

335
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,139
stores they've got all the lights on all

336
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,180
the lights are on everywhere you go

337
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,799
because all the businesses are open that

338
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,239
means that electricity is more on demand

339
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,219
which means guess what they charge more

340
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,539
for it when everybody goes home and

341
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,399
everyone's just chilling late at night

342
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,838
electricity gets cheaper because we

343
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,639
don't need as much of it so it's more

344
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,519
cost effective for a grower to run the

345
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,078
lights at night but it's kind of a pain

346
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,339
in the ass for a commercial growth so I

347
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,078
wouldn't recommend that for a commercial

348
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,420
facility unless you've got a dedicated

349
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,578
night shift which this facility does not

350
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,860
have so the first assumption is power

351
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,139
limitations the second question the

352
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,240
second assumption would probably be air

353
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,539
conditioning limitations other than that

354
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,220
I am not sure uh why that would be an

355
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,620
effective idea why that would be a good

356
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,720
strategy I think my next move would be

357
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,940
to ask management ask ownership hey why

358
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,379
do we do this uh is there a night shift

359
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,720
that will be happening are we going to

360
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,700
change this just ask very politely like

361
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,440
can we run both of these rooms all at

362
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,540
one time because what's going to happen

363
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
in my opinion I'm not there I don't know

364
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,019
how hard you guys work I don't know what

365
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,338
you're capable of but this makes me

366
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,620
think that you're gonna have one room

367
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,779
that's always growing like top shelf

368
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,759
weed and another room that's just not as

369
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,259
good as the other all the time because

370
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,419
you're only able to spend so many hours

371
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,819
that night shift room uh whichever one

372
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,379
goes off at 11 A.M uh you know if you

373
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,360
come in at six you only get five hours

374
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,500
to work in there if you come in in what

375
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,940
you're not going to get enough time to

376
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,200
work in that room or the other ones if

377
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,640
you've got an eight or ten hour shift

378
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,500
you're gonna have to divide up five

379
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,879
hours in each room it's not going to be

380
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,320
you're not going to get the quality that

381
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,240
you could if you just ran it all at once

382
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,278
so my first question would be do we have

383
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,500
the power capabilities can we run all of

384
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,759
this at one time the next question would

385
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,379
be do we have the air conditioning

386
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,819
capability these and then the next

387
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,159
question is do they think they've got

388
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,660
the Staffing trained and available to do

389
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,578
that if you build an auto watering

390
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,379
system and you don't have to water every

391
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:00,599
plant by hand if you can just focus on

392
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,879
Cut the Clones on time get the Clones

393
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,740
transplanted into the next pots get the

394
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,019
small plants transplanted into large

395
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,000
pots have the large pots prepared in 30

396
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,500
days to go into the flower room then

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,578
once they go into the flower room you go

398
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,440
back into the other room and you cut

399
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,000
more clones and push everything up into

400
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,680
that space if you can accomplish that

401
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,519
Rhythm it shouldn't take a lot of people

402
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,719
to accomplish that rhythm in up to 85 to

403
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,700
115-ish lights that could take one or

404
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,040
two people I've ran a hundred life

405
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,379
facility uh plugs 100 flowering lights

406
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,240
plus a bedroom plus a mom area with

407
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,700
myself as the lead cultivator and two

408
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,200
backup guys one guy to help me out every

409
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,240
day of the week and then on the weekends

410
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,500
I would take the weekends off and those

411
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
two guys would run the ship on the

412
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,039
weekends plus a trim team sometimes we

413
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
did have a full-on trim team because

414
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,778
that's a lot of work but the cultivation

415
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,820
100 lights is one person with one or two

416
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,559
backup people helping that's my opinion

417
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,240
that's it my experience that's what I

418
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,859
could train for so I'd see if the staff

419
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,079
has confidence or if the management has

420
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,579
confidence and the staff if not let's

421
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,439
automate some [ __ ] let's get some Auto

422
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,879
watering going on there let's learn how

423
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,620
to Trellis more effectively it'll turn

424
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,240
out a pop and twist let's learn how to

425
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,919
defoliate let's learn how to let's learn

426
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,600
how to manage the room the gear the

427
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,860
equipment and the plants to save

428
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,200
ourselves time there's so much

429
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,940
automation AI is going to take over very

430
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,160
soon let's learn how to do a lot of that

431
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,700
[ __ ] before AI pushes us out of a job

432
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,199
all right my dude Neil stir thank you

433
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,180
for the great question I hope I answered

434
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,339
that one uh my uh once again my

435
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,259
assumptions are power limitations but I

436
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,579
really don't do not know why

437
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,200
um I used to have a room like this back

438
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:30,659
in the day let me get ramble in here for

439
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,600
a minute I used to have a an office it

440
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:36,778
was like an 11 by 14 office space and in

441
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,639
that room I put two 5x5 grow tents but I

442
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,039
wasn't able to increase the power in

443
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,139
that room I could not run 2 000 watts of

444
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,299
light at one time but I could run 1000

445
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,940
all the time with no problem so I bought

446
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,979
a device called a flip box and I plugged

447
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,199
one ballast into the flip box and the

448
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,120
flip box then plugged into a timer then

449
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,559
went into the wall it sounds more

450
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,659
complicated than it is but what would

451
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:01,018
happen is one ballast would run to

452
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,240
basically a y cable that would go for 12

453
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,980
hours it would go to 10 B and then for

454
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,899
the opposite 12 hours they would go to

455
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,399
tent a and there was just a little box

456
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,559
that attached to my ballast it would

457
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,539
just redirect the power to which bulb so

458
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,399
I was able to run I constantly had that

459
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,259
room flowering I had two five by fives

460
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,879
flowering in that room film and I did

461
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,958
never have to overload the power that

462
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,360
kind of feels like what they're doing

463
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,799
here on a larger scale but it's kind of

464
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
a pain in the ass if you're not able to

465
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,359
get into the rooms I would ask them

466
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,860
about it don't be shy ask questions see

467
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,180
if we can make [ __ ] better let them know

468
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,379
you're only asking questions because you

469
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,958
feel like you could improve your

470
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,759
performance if the rooms were on more

471
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,319
even schedules all right my dude thank

472
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,879
you for the great question please don't

473
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,980
forget to send me your address with a

474
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,159
real quality name so I can ship you a

475
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,720
free pack of irie Genetics seeds alright

476
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,120
podcast world let's keep this party

477
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,399
moving this next question came from my

478
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,019
friend Alabama man big shout out to my

479
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
dude Alabama man thank you for the

480
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,039
continued patreon support I do

481
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,240
appreciate that the question goes a

482
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,559
little bit like this first of all it

483
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,940
says what kind of problem what kind of

484
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,799
question do you have it's a problem in

485
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,839
my garden what strain are you growing

486
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,578
they're seven year old beans from

487
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,500
Nirvana Seed Bank which is pretty cool

488
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,319
where are you growing them indoors under

489
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,600
LEDs we're in veg uh we're in week three

490
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,579
of veg or growing in Cocoa then the

491
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,259
question goes a lot like this and says

492
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,719
Hey Brother what's up bro good to see

493
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,879
you it says I was so proud to have

494
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,680
germinated seven-year-old seeds a while

495
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,958
back yeah sometimes old seeds are a real

496
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,698
[ __ ] to pop so I'm proud of you for

497
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,799
having gotten those going it says they

498
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:31,379
popped within 48 hours and responded

499
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,939
well to normal feedings and lighting and

500
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,000
always looked happy but remained a

501
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,440
little bit miniature in Forum uh that

502
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
could just been genetics that could have

503
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,720
been that they were tired it could have

504
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,919
been that they were old it could have

505
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,959
just been the kind of plants that they

506
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,000
were it does go on

507
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,500
I topped the plants at week three and it

508
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,419
demanded more newts like normal but

509
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,000
never sparked an outward or upward

510
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,519
growth spur after week three I yanked it

511
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,860
it had a beautiful root system too I

512
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
take meticulous care of my seed bank but

513
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,480
everything like like everything time

514
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
took its toll I suppose all right that's

515
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,439
a good assumption there is more to this

516
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,959
it says what is the oldest seed you have

517
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,579
ever popped I don't think the seeds I've

518
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,720
popped have ever been super old if I'm

519
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,279
gonna pop something it's probably

520
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,039
something I recently bought I'm kind of

521
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,199
eager to grow [ __ ] when I buy it

522
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,119
um and I don't store seeds for a real

523
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,679
long time I'd like to say no more than

524
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,359
three or five maybe seven or eight years

525
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,040
old did try to run some old stuff a

526
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,418
while back in like you only some of it

527
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,338
popped up and a couple of things that

528
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,079
did pop up didn't look good what came

529
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,579
out of it was really good stuff but some

530
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,859
of it just did not look healthy so I

531
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,539
understand what happened to you most of

532
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:35,459
the time I buy my seeds and I either

533
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,720
grow them right away or if I've still

534
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,919
got them it's because I've had them for

535
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
years and years and I'm not going to

536
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
grow them and I should probably give

537
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,119
them to one of my friends to grow so

538
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,558
we'll dig into the Vault one day and

539
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,479
share some of that stuff it's says

540
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,759
should I trash all of my seven-year-old

541
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,259
beans no no if you're going to trash

542
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,079
them at least try to grow them before

543
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,579
you trash them what could go wrong skip

544
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,259
straight to the trash can and just put

545
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,240
them into a paper towel or however you

546
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,319
germinate try that first then if they

547
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,298
don't work then put them in the trash

548
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,918
but at least give them a try you may

549
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:04,859
have some [ __ ] Magic In Those Old

550
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,299
seeds so they could be shitty even if

551
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,038
they were new that's something to think

552
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,259
about those seeds even when they were

553
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,058
new they might have been subpar seeds

554
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,279
not every seed is an amazing plant not

555
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:17,160
every seed is going to be a top shelf

556
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,178
grow so even if those were new even if

557
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,679
they were old they could have been

558
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,600
terrible they could have been awesome we

559
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,038
can't attribute all of it to age we're

560
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,119
gonna blame it on age we're going to

561
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,798
attribute that we're going to say that

562
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,439
you did everything you could and they

563
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,720
were just bad old seeds but

564
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,038
oh no don't toss all your old seeds try

565
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,019
to grow them dude see what they do

566
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,460
instead of if you're looking to grow two

567
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,019
or three plants germinate 10 of those

568
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,940
bad [ __ ] and see what comes up

569
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,619
uh Power and numbers you might get

570
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,538
something super super cool out of there

571
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,099
old weed was really great some of the

572
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,359
older weed was really awesome so

573
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,058
whatever you had back in the day might

574
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,798
be amazing so keep trying those seeds

575
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,079
could be even new seeds sometimes are

576
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,400
shitty sometimes I make a cross and the

577
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,779
seeds will Sprout and I can tell right

578
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,700
away like oh we're not going to be able

579
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,259
to release that one that's just you can

580
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,360
see it sometimes so who knows what you

581
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,279
had who knows what they were now it says

582
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,319
what a clone from the same plant I

583
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,678
pulled exhibit the same growth habits as

584
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,819
its stunted mother it should

585
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,059
technically genetically

586
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:16,740
scientifically it should comma but uh

587
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:18,779
sometimes like I said earlier some of

588
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,579
those freaky ass plants the first time

589
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,980
you grow it if you cut a clone and grow

590
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,418
that clone out it will do different [ __ ]

591
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,400
I've got a plant that I put in a

592
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,840
different room recently it's never been

593
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,220
in this environment before and I'm

594
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,558
seeing different [ __ ] from a plant that

595
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,940
I've ever seen before a lot of times it

596
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,918
could be about the environment that

597
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,480
weird [ __ ] you saw could be like I said

598
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,000
earlier it could be hot soil over

599
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,919
moisture too much humidity too dry

600
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,298
sometimes those seedlings will tell you

601
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,160
right away like there's a [ __ ]

602
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,019
problem in here but then it'll grow out

603
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,298
of it and you'll cut that clone and the

604
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,679
Clone is the same age as that original

605
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,720
plant so if you've had that original

606
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,460
plant for eight weeks and then you cut

607
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,140
the Clone that clone is technically

608
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,240
eight weeks old it's still continuing

609
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,100
it's still got part of that age to it

610
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,480
it's just grown out of that wonky [ __ ]

611
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,759
so maybe it won't go back to it

612
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,798
sometimes it does sometimes it grows out

613
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,538
of it so I don't have a solid uh

614
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,179
definite infinite answer for that

615
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,679
because the answer is it should but

616
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,538
sometimes just because that's how

617
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,160
genetics and nature work I can't make

618
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,259
any promises when it comes to that one

619
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,700
all right my dude Alabama man I hope I

620
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,140
answered your question don't be

621
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,298
discouraged with your old seeds don't

622
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,500
throw your seed collection away they

623
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,418
still look good in the vault they still

624
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,859
count as a good collection and when you

625
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,360
do try to grow them maybe they'll work

626
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,859
maybe they won't if you put them

627
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,240
straight in the trash you'll never know

628
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,119
if they were any good or not so keep

629
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,279
trying also before we wrap this up I'm

630
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,619
going to recommend a product called herb

631
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,839
that is spelled urb it's a little bit

632
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,418
expensive but it does work very well at

633
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,918
helping get old seeds going also if you

634
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,538
want to be creative and you want to do a

635
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,220
little bit of research on your own I'm

636
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:49,319
going to leave this up to you a little

637
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,120
bit of gibberellic acid a little ga3

638
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,279
will definitely help get those seeds

639
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,719
going but you've got some work to do to

640
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,460
check on that yourself there are safety

641
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,740
precautions to take there are a lot of

642
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,900
risks involved when using the ga3 so be

643
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,259
very careful if you choose to go that

644
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,419
route once again as a disclaimer as a

645
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,099
safety measure as a legal disclaimer be

646
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,960
[ __ ] careful all right I think that's

647
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,699
