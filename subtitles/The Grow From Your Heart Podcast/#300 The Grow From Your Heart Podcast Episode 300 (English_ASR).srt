me that you did that right on yeah yeah

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,629
it was just a decision I made and

79
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,360
fortunately enough I was able to just

80
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,549
make it and do it

81
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,060
I still hung out with all the same

82
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,370
friends I still went to local shows at

83
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,409
bars and things I didn't really shy away

84
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,240
I was on a pool league so that was all

85
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,280
at bars Wow

86
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,050
you know I've had free drinks offered to

87
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,759
me by close friends and whatnot and it's

88
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,650
just something I don't want it's almost

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,629
like tobacco or cigarettes or something

90
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,159
it's just something that's not appealing

91
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,120
it's something I just don't care for and

92
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,770
don't want anymore

93
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,259
good job and I was able to make a bunch

94
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,510
of even more positive changes in my life

95
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,069
so you know it's it's awesome I was able

96
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,649
to get my own car my own place to live

97
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,409
you know have a pretty stable life now

98
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,060
which is much better than it was I was

99
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,109
ruining all the relationships that I had

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,120
so completely around and being able to

101
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,550
earn most of those back even with the

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,739
people that I hurt the most and was the

103
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,200
closest with is something that I'm

of the things about our community that I

194
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,029
always kind of shake my head at is we

195
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,660
should not always represent ourselves

196
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,089
well

197
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,290

204
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,709
conversation without it being an

205
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,590
argument yes so please do that if you go

208
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,180
talk about what we're smoking on but

209
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,430
apparently we smoke so much of it that

210
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,680
we don't know what the [ __ ] anymore

217
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:18,120
a CBD level in it so it's kind of pretty

218
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,759
nice after a while and then next was

219
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,370

220
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,659

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,939
to sure on the label or anything where

229
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,489
the flower came from exactly but who

230
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,920
ever grew it was fantastic so this most

231
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,840
recent batch of garden of Weeden sour

232
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:55,620
strawberry whoever drew that material

233
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,090
was shadow garden of Weeden once again

234
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,500
miss you kids let's hang out more

235
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,030
frequently I go see them occasionally

236
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,950
not often enough so then we shifted into

237
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,740
Mike brought some Sour Diesel live resin

238
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,500
from CSC concentrate supply company it's

239
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,860
just straight fuel they open the jar and

240
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,299
keV goes that's gasoline

241
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,830
like I don't know like a kid licking a

242
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:23,129
window you can smell right now is

243
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,540
gasoline good job I didn't get one of

244
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,939
those no I just didn't grab one of those

245
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,529
I could have I chose to smoke some

246
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,030
Skywalker batter and I've been talking

247
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,259
about the Skywalker banner for a minute

248
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:34,589
so everybody knows what that's like

249
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:38,429
then we upped our game ah that's when

250
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:41,340
everybody went full art art

251
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:43,079
we grab some of these Clementine high

252
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,360
cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

253
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,840
crystals that are they're calling it the

254
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,279
diamonds there were two maybe three two

255
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,560
and a tiny piece in here that were the

256
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,319
gram so it's high cannabinoid

257
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,179
full-spectrum extract chunks there are

258
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,460
two half gram chunks in this container

259
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:04,259
we took medium sized dabs and coughed

260
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,759
our faces often then giggled for about

261
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,080
ten minutes and then we had to take a

262
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,580
little break and then we decided to

263
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:18,960
record and it feels like we may have

264
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:21,120
taken too short of a break I've got that

265
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,440
like weird my face feels strange I'm

266
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,840
like looking around the room like is

267
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,850
this where we are it is where we are

268
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,340
then after that I thought I'd get stupid

269
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,470
I've got some gorilla glue they're

270
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,019
calling this the ambrosia it's got some

271
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,759
big crystals in there some big THC

272
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,220
crystals and a lot of Turkey sauce I

273
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,629
took a nice sized abyss these guys made

274
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,279
fun of me because when I dabbed it my

275
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,309
face turn different colors Mike's

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,639
looking concentrates right now yeah it's

277
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:50,159
a little diamond sauce right yeah like

278
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,319
geez how much came in that container

279
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,509
originally that's a gram I just took one

280
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,190
tiny that's just a Grammy well it looks

281
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,509
like three from here I know to me I'm

282
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:04,140
like damn it I wish there was way more

283
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:12,539
in that container number four that's

284
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:14,610
because one Kevin brought up the theory

285
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,789
of it it's like nachos I'm calling it

286
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:21,750
the nacho if it's stuck together it's

287
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:23,759
one dab dude you just took a miniscule

288
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,049
dab of this Clementine high cannabinoid

289
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,860
full-spectrum extract Dimond crystal

290
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:31,049
imagine what would happen to you if you

291
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,310
dabbed that thing I know that's point

292
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,500
seven and that one right there's

293
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,869
probably point four point two I'm gonna

294
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,850
say that's point six I don't know I'm

295
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,320
just guessing probably point six of a

296
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,810
gram I'd say point six and point three

297
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,740
or 0.6 and point for I would cough til

298
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,089
next year

299
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,240
Mike you're gonna cough just looking at

300
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,240
it

301
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,319
that's impressive I'm done with you that

302
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:57,539
sounds like the theory of the dude who

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,150
sells the diamonds yeah I don't remember

304
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:08,370
whose page I read that on but I read it

305
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:09,809
on somebody's was the profile so you

306
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,769

308
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,789

312

vacation is gonna be like Rasta Jeff

313
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,760
said this so we figured you'll we'll

314
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,229
split it and you know don't eat edibles

315
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,269
or dab like me unless you're experienced

316
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,009
you guys that that will lead to disaster

317
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:33,720
and naps and I have to add a disclaimer

318
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,100
to the front of the show ladies and

319
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,680
gentlemen we are not professionals but

320
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,970
we do play some on podcasts we

321
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:44,309
professionals get paid that's where that

322
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:50,430
line gets drawn all right then yeah all

323
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:51,778
right speaking of getting paid champions

324
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,709
for me at the start of this episode

325
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,269
which is good because we're gonna take

326
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,600

327
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,069
the fun part of the show ah

328
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,360
if you watch the YouTube videos and

329
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,200
don't forget to watch the YouTube videos

330
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,959

331
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,089
podcast YouTube channel ah there are 200

332
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,469
YouTube videos up now which means that

333
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,080
there are a hundred episodes in the feed

334
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,910
you've got 201 through 300 in the feed

335
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,290
and then you've got 1 through 200 on

336
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:14,850
YouTube you can listen to all the

337
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,679
podcast episodes right now which is

338
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,000
pretty cool I think I'm kind of caught

339
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,099
up for a minute I still need to make

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,470
more videos but here's what I'm getting

341
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,190
at all the old episodes have other

342
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,410
people's music in it and YouTube hates

343
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,270
me for that every time I post new video

344
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,189
it's like copyright claim copyright

345
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,449
violation and they're not doing anything

346
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,790
to me they're just saying I can't

347
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,500
monetize the page and they limit things

348
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:39,449
and advertising for me they don't put me

349
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,490
in other people's like up-and-coming

350
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,080
videos I don't get as much play because

351
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,940
I'm using other people's copyrighted

352
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,250
[ __ ] so if you noticed at the start of

353
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,870
the show I played a brand new track that

354
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,970
was produced by Rasta Geoff with

355
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,039
GarageBand you'll hear some new music

356
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,528
coming up that's why there's different

357
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,719
music I'm trying to not piss off YouTube

358
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:59,700
so much so starting with episode 300

359
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,860
there will be new music it'll be I

360
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,340
probably have to stop using other

361
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,419
people's music unless

362
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,680
unless you've got music that you have

363
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,839
produced and you would like to hear on

364
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,059
the podcast and you can give me full

365
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,470
permission to use when I put it up on

366
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,969
YouTube and they flagged me and say hey

367
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,560
you can't do this it's gonna piss me off

368
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,720
so don't put some music up there that

369
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,879
you can't give me full copyright and

370
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,649
permission to use so if you've published

371
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,450
it on iTunes or YouTube I probably can't

372
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,490
do it if you would like to make me a

373
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,350
tract or make me some music I'd love to

enunciate that it doesn't have to be

395
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,870
reggae that's true but if it's an intro

396
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,970

gonna cough and he thought he went deaf

467
00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:01,549
the sound in my headphones went to and

468
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,750
when I realized that I explained I'm so

469
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:07,369
glad that's not the weed and I wish I

470
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,049
had been recording but unfortunately it

471
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:13,039
was one of those beautiful moments but

472
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:15,109
yes one of those fun side effects the

473
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,690
[ __ ] all the anti weed propaganda I

474
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:19,279
sit through every day is like every time

475
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,779
I get a good hit and it rings my bell a

476
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,700
minute I'm like oh is this the weed

477
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,099
psychosis I've heard about am I finally

478
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,710
gonna see some [ __ ]

479
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:29,269
and now I just get a little higher than

480
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:36,460
giggle for a minute and come back down

481
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:36,460
you haven't gone crazy yet from the weed

482
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:45,349
yeah they say you can't OD on cannabis

483
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,058
but I've been trying you know I'm sorry

484
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:49,159
this is a point to think where you might

485
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:51,589
be able to with all the new distillation

486
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,050
stuff but if you took like a big 2-liter

487
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,599
something like drank it of like

488
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,079
distillate probably would get pretty

489
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,889
sick

490
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,509
I'd imagine we've please don't do that

491
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:07,790
if you've got a 2-liter a distillate no

492
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:12,019
let's kick it the original equation was

493
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:16,190
something like 45 hay bales worth of Bud

494
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:19,819
in like an hour was what it would take

495
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,670
to even approach a lethal dose and when

496
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:24,289
they did the conversion like they were

497
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,630
probably working with five or seven

498
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:32,178
percent THC herb I've been pondering and

499
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,720
if you got pure enough distillate in a

500
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,610
big enough batch of it like it's you

501
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,160
still got to get it into the person and

502
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:41,299
get it absorbed at that point like if

503
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,250
you try to drink a two liter a

504
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,049
distillate about your third gulp your

505
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,299
body's just gonna vomit up four cups of

506
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:54,289
dislike yeah but that's just a little

507
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:55,639
coating I don't think my body would even

508
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:59,779
let me well it's like trying to swallow

509
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:03,020
a mouthful if anybody would like to

510
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:05,379
donate a cup of distillate we'd like to

511
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:05,379
see Kevin

512
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:16,640

513
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:19,369

514

purposes I got I'll put up the iPad with

516
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:32,359

517
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:35,960

518
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,408

519

whole show now would you dad question

523
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,669
you looked in the table in awe and had

524
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,909
no idea for a moment where did this come

525
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:07,000
from

526
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm pretty sure his mouth to guess

527
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:18,409
alright let's get serious for a second

528
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:21,019
on episode 300 we have done four years

529
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,120
worth of podcast 300 shows we had a

530
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,460
hundred thousand downloads in February

531
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,199
Kevin hasn't consumed alcohol in 20

532
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,538
months there are so many things to be

533
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,490
grateful for Mike's got a healthy

534
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,808
healthy kid sorry Mike I'm trying to

535
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,769
include you in all the celebration here

536
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:42,589
I didn't know if I was supposed to

537
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:44,359
mention that so I hesitated at this

538
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:46,699
point though we're so far past 12 weeks

539
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,879

542
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:57,019
Mike a small setup with a microphone

543
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,369
that he can plug into his computer so

544
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,869
that we can Skype and do shows together

545
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:03,379
like that so that he can have a kid on

546
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:04,939
his lap because I can get away for an

547
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,860
hour to a night I just can't leave the

548
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,210
[ __ ] house is the baby monitor s to

549
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,949
be able to blink behind the microphone

550
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,480
yeah yeah we got you there bro we'll set

551
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,069
you up with something I can't drive

552
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,899
across town to [ __ ] feed a kid a

553
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:16,668
bottle or change a diaper once we get

554
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:18,709
another MacBook to replace this thing

555
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,028
that's going super slow we will

556
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,259
get you a microphone and just plug it

557
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,940
right into your computer I'll teach you

558

like you can from here boom sounds like

563
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:33,349
a good way to produce a [ __ ] load of

564
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:35,270
content and you can probably smoke

565

attitude their approach to life

593
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:47,028
apparently I'm the only person that some

594
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,440
people interact with which is kind of

595
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:52,519
neat I'm kind of know I'd rather not go

596
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,140
out in public and deal with a lot of

597
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,089
people sometimes it's just it doesn't

598
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,038
seem like that once you know me that's

599
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,048
one of the community character traits

600
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,579
yeah yeah I was Eve more ofter than

601
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,869
there's a grower for so long that I just

602
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,460
became a hermit and didn't want to do

603
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,709
with other people because then they were

604
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,329
probably snitches or thieves or cops or

605
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,980
a problem if they weren't somebody that

606
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,528
I already knew so it kind of made me

607
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,778
weird you're right but I get a lot of my

608
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:16,730
social interaction from the social media

609

that's that's awesome I remember when

636
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:13,969
you were talking about the idea of doing

637
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:18,108
it and how excited you were about like

638
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:21,349
doing this concept and sharing cannabis

639
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:23,868
news and just grow tips and whatever

640
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:26,318

641
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:29,028
the plant and Industry and patience and

642
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:31,548
it was awesome to see that from the

643
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:33,588
beginning and to have you still here

644
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:36,009
with the same passion and love for it

645
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:40,190
and even more so have developed it into

646
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:41,959
a semi comedy podcast as well and have

647
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,759

00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:46,699
getting all of the information across

649
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,489
and sharing the lives of your friends

650
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:52,038
and fellow cannabis industry people

651
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:54,528
which is amazing you're spreading a lot

652
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:57,408
more than yourself which is awesome

653
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:59,538
because a lot of people just kind of get

654
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:01,278
their self and their idea out there and

655
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:06,048
you do a lot more than that you you

656
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:08,388
thank you Mike for most of another show

657
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:09,499
that I caught advertising print if you

658
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:11,298
wrote them an email and said I have

659
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:12,709
spider mites they'd say buy this product

660
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:14,269
and you would hear him talk about that

661
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:16,548
product through the entire episode and I

662
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:17,749
felt that that was kind of shitty but I

663
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,940
didn't want to do that yes I do

664
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:21,769
advertise things you guys but you notice

665
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,788
I've got two advertisers on this episode

666
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,989
you haven't heard anything about him

667
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:25,669
you're the one at the start of the show

668
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:27,588
you'll hear one later two brief

669
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:29,028
advertisements I'm not gonna bombard you

670
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,138
with them the whole show people that

671
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,788
want to support me they want their

672
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:33,288
product known we're not gonna crush you

673
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:34,489
with it I tried to put out like Kemp

674
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,989
said I tried to put out a genuine show

675
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:38,328
this I don't have a filter

676
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:39,619
I couldn't keep [ __ ] back if I wanted to

677
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:41,118
I don't think so I just come out and

678
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:43,428
express myself and I think it's

679
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:45,168
hilarious that people have started

680
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,440
saying that my show has got a touch of

681
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,970
comedy to it because that

682
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,429
wasn't what I intended at all when I

683
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,350
started no it wasn't it was to spread

684
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,720
information and knowledge and what's

685
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:56,490
happening yet within the industry so

686
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,259
people could experience it and

687
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,169
understand the first hundred episodes

688
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,058
Sam I can keep the first a hundred

689
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,950
episodes are me reading a script like

690
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,778
because I wanted to be so I didn't want

691
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,940
to make any mistakes I'd yeah the the

692
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:10,169
magnitude of my advice to people cuz

693
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,399
they trust me you know I mean I'm going

694
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:11,879
out there saying I'm the guy to listen

695
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,500
to

696
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:15,329
I'd better get it [ __ ] right I don't

697
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,798
want to make however many people listen

698
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:20,009
to that episode they may ruin their

699
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,028
garden yeah so I didn't but I don't

700
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:22,319
remember I was gonna go ahead Mike I

701
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:24,659
keep telling you off so I'll let you one

702
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,220
of the things that I mean it was it

703
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,110
wasn't there as much in the beginning

704
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,940
but there was still a good Pete part of

705
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:32,219
this and it's grown to be a bigger part

706
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,169
of the show over the years but like it's

707
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,019
highly educational but it doesn't feel

708
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:39,690
like school yeah class feel like you're

709
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,460
sitting there trying to learn stuff but

710
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,379
you learn a whole bunch that's not

711
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,179
because I wasn't a good student because

712
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:46,469
school was like that but I had a few

713
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,149
teachers that knew that about me

714
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,669
shout-out to the good teachers teachers

715
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:53,250
that are good cuz all three of us in

716
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,259
this room are bad [ __ ] students we're

717
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,240
[ __ ] here Mike's a Genco kid like

718
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,099
Kevin's a tattoo kid I'm [ __ ] Rasta

719
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,388
Jeff like we were the kid that were

720
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,589
sneaking off gettin high together we all

721
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,089
went to different schools at different

722
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:04,138
times but if we knew each other you

723
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,519
would have snuck I would have been

724
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:09,928
suspended for smoke and weed together

725
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,388
all the time yeah yeah so we were bad

726
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,590
students if we had good teachers I would

727
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:16,079
have gone to school more I had a few

728
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,970
teachers a band teacher that saved my

729
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,398
whole school [ __ ] thing without him I

730
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,019

733
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,250

the weird the most published story I've

768
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,750
heard in a while all right

769
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,980
I remember what I was talking about

770
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,019
earlier when I was talking about all my

771
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,339
sounded scripted I used to write [ __ ]

772
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,759
out like because I didn't want to screw

773
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:19,980
anybody up so they were used to research

774
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,839
different topics you'd like I want to

775
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,549
write a show on blank I know enough

776
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:29,279
about it to do a show and you'd still

777
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:31,019
spend two weeks now and now I'm so

778
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,730
confident that I've gotten wrote the

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,980
I said accountability earlier I can't I

785
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,899

786
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,339
everything I'm about to say I've said

787
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,620
things that I've exaggerated me like no

788
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,759
wait wait I might be wrong I like maybe

789
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,928
I'm wrong in that maybe I'm exaggerating

790
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,980
maybe I don't remember that story right

791
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,630
and I have to like think about it cuz

792
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,460
I'm like well I'm being recorded I don't

793

795
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:01,589
something and it also makes me a better

796
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,120
speaker and a better communicator but

797
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:04,589
I've gotten really comfortable I did I

798

817
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,308

820
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:45,808
opinions and we didn't have a guest one

821

857
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:08,488
the same people as Wade he worked at a

858
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,759

859
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,950
age

860
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,839
he worked at Phil's I used to go to

861
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,399
Phil's I'd get shit-faced we knew each

862
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:18,148
other we'd hang out we knew all the same

863
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,709
people we got along but never like hung

864
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:20,849
out you know I mean we all like we were

865
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,890
all we're friends in that

866
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:25,500
yeah and Carl grunt like we had so many

867
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,670
things yeah but we had nothing against

868
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,230
each other we'd high-five movers we

869
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,130
walked by but we didn't he'd never been

870
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,660
to my house and [ __ ]

871
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,950
then keV was like hey man I've been

872
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,269
hanging out with Wade Ridley and I was

873
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,410
like men bring him to the house like

874
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,039
just [ __ ] bring him by seems like a

875
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,660
cool guy

876
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,859
I've always liked his vibe we've always

877
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,400
gotten along so Wade and I started

878
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:44,069
hanging out and Wade and I loved hated

879
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,019
each other like we agreed disagreed on

880
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:47,339
so much [ __ ] but we were adults and so

881
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,490
we could have great disagreement

882
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:52,409
conversations and Wade loves to play

883
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,000
devil's advocate just like I do so we

884
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,590
would both just troll each other and

885
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,940
does it would get hot down in the

886
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:58,619
basement we'd have to come up here and

887
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,580
smoke dabs and calm down to be like bro

888
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,439
that's we can't have this conversation

889
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,960
on the couch down here we got to go in a

890
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,400
bigger space and get like fresh air and

891
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,870
be a little further apart from each

892
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,090
other cuz this is getting weird

893
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:10,589
like sometimes we want to punch each

894
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,880
other but we'd like man this is good

895
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,740
it's what we're asking for you know what

896
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,329
I mean so we started a podcast together

897
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,889
he started a podcast and I was like that

898
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,389
needs love dude and he's like what would

899
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,859
you do and I was like I've got all this

900
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,569
gear I would plug all this gear out of

901
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,670
there all my sound equipment and he's

902
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,670
like oh like heal it up and yeah so he

903
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:28,769
started the podcast and then uh [ __ ]

904
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,900
we're doing a lot of podcasts I would

905
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:32,550
talk about cannabis occasionally and he

906
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,990
would feel like he would give me this

907
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,550
vibe of that's not what I want to be

908
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,979
doing like he would kind of rush me

909
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,440
through it but then cannabis became

910
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,909
recreational legal in Colorado and I was

911
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,500
the first person to purchase

912
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,589
recreational cannabis in Pueblo Colorado

913
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,940
at the greener side on the south side at

914
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,450
stem Beach it's now called doctor's

915
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,400
orders

916
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:52,169
it was the greener side my buddy Hank

917
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,150
used to own it as a first person to shop

918
00:34:52,170 --> 00:35:00,119
there wait and I I got to be on the news

919
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:03,240
for that so Wade came here after so I'm

920
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,849
like back every news station in Colorado

921
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,969
picked a dispensary kind of at random to

922
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:10,710
do what Jeff did the day marijuana first

923
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:13,500
became legal in Colorado like every

924
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,949
every news channel had they're the first

925
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,510
customer yeah um and it was cool that

926
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,379
you were the one down here for our right

927
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,450

I don't remember yes KOAT

929
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:24,569
five-and-thirty I'm pretty sure pretty

930
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,019
sure Michelle San Miguel was the

931
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:29,640
reporter that helped me out so I met up

932
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:31,889
with Michelle right after I walk out and

933
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,710
then we talked she interviews me and

934
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:36,118
then I come home and I call wait

935
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,070
where are you bro we should record about

936
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,269

937
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,720
came over here he goes I got a better

938
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:42,269
idea

939
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,098
let's go down there and so we drove back

940
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:46,079
to the greener side and Michelle San

941
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:47,220
Miguel was still there and she came up

942
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,690
to me and she said hey do you have any

943
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,579
of the weedy bought earlier I was like

944
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,588
no it's at home she goes we want to

945
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,719
watch people smoke and I was like oh

946
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:56,099
it's illegal to smoke out here and Mike

947
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,289
and I kind of looked at each other and

948
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,940
mike is Mike's a little more

949
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,619
level-headed than myself Mike's a little

950
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,780
a boor of a different thinker I got

951
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,289
caught up in the spirit of the day I'm a

952
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,859
rebel

953
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:10,259
I'll cowboy the [ __ ] up I'm I I'm down

954
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:12,029
to break the rules obviously and I

955
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,640
looked at what it was an insane day like

956
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,030
doors a dude driving by throwing weed

957
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,670
and planted people yeah just Brockville

958
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,980
4x4 plants and he'd pull up and honk in

959
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,900
half the line would run up to his truck

960
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,210
and come back like what do I do now and

961
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,119
then run her plant to that car and then

962
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,400
try to reform a quarter mile long line

963
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,230
it as best they could from many people

964
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,789
people were certainly smoking bowls and

965
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,380
joints in that line and security guards

966
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,489
are walking by going please put that out

967
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,140
guys and they just walk away

968
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,579
they just they'd have to do their job

969
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,920
until you not do but they didn't do [ __ ]

970
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,170
the helicopters overhead getting footage

Michelle San Miguel comes here we smoke

1017
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:16,108
and then that ends up on the news it is

1018
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:18,149
part of the ABC World News or something

1019
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:22,650
the bacon player yeah they can play it

1020
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,480
whenever it's been yes but it was one of

1021
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,190
the major news organizations they own it

1022
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,568
and they play it on their [ __ ] all the

1023
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,519
time when they talk about cannabis so

1024
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:34,019
Mike and Wayde and I are seen worldwide

1025
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,940
movie role now yeah all right but Wayde

1026
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,980
and I talked about that a lot on the

1027
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,619
podcast on the seven one nine the blocks

1028
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,699
podcast and that kind of before Wade was

1029
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,019
like nobody wants to hear about we

1030
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,980
nobody wants to hear about weed but now

1031
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,199
that it was legal and it was

1032
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,240
revolutionising revolution it was a

1033
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,338
revolutionary topic I can take myself

1034
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,229
out of holes pretty good it was a huge

1035
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:55,710
topic Wade would give me some space on

1036
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,880
the podcast to talk about it and then he

1037
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,108
got bored with it he didn't want me to

1038
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
talk about it as much and then his

1039
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:01,949
relationship and I and the podcast he

1040
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,568
kind of quit doing that podcast and it

1041
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:06,000
kind of fizzled and he moved to Kentucky

1042
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:08,009
and then I started doing my own show I

1043
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,539
was like we had both shows at the same

1044
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,770
time and he didn't want to do my segment

1045
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:13,079
so I just sorted doing a whole weed show

1046
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:14,400
and that's kind of how we came to the

1047
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,050
podcast so without wait I don't know

1048
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,480
that I would be doing a campus podcast I

1049
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,519
had talked about it there I think there

1050
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,230
was enough bad information and that was

1051
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:27,300
pissing you off at the time to the

1052
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:29,400
degree you were outlined in a book for a

1053
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,810
while yeah and there was no chance to be

1054
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,150
putting out a book because I've got a TD

1055
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,369
and it changes so much I was getting

1056
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,059
ready to be like dude I'll ghost write

1057
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:38,039
that [ __ ]

1058
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,509
well me what to say I would go to

1059
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,420
Spencer in Matty's house all the time

1060
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,650
the garden of Weeden crew and spins well

1061
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,119
they would invite me over and then we'd

1062
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,710
get high as [ __ ] and I didn't want to go

1063
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,170
home because I didn't be here a home

1064
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,490
alone and Mady and Spence and the dogs

1065
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,780
are there but Spence would get high and

1066
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,068
want to go play with this plants and

1067
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,839
Maddie would just be sitting there

1068
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:56,009
sometimes they'd have other people come

1069
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:57,869
over and this guy

1070
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,820
Micke kept coming over and asking me and

1071
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,259
Maddy apologize she's like I'm sorry he

1072
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,390
has so many questions I was like I like

1073
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,860
it he's making my brain spin he's making

1074
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:06,539
me think and I love that about the

1075
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,849
podcast it makes me a better grower but

1076
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,320
Nick kept asking questions and then Nick

1077
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,539
left and Travis came over and asked the

1078
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,340
same [ __ ] questions and Maddy's like

1079
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,750
god I'm so sorry it's the same [ __ ]

1080
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,850
question I was like you know what I'm

1081
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,409
gonna start recording this like and then

1082
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,789
I was like no wait I'm really go I was

1083
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:22,289
kind of a smartass joke I was like I'm

1084
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,429
just gonna put my phone out and just

1085
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,539
record it and then the next time

1086
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:27,029
somebody asks I'm gonna hit play but I

1087
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,320
was like no wait I've got a podcast like

1088
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,120
I can just go to a podcast and that's

1089
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,860
gonna what a lot of what started it so

1090
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,750
the book idea and you're right people

1091
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,980
pissing me off on the forums I saw

1092
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,900
people telling people to use coffee

1093
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,389
grounds to fix nitrogen we had a bunch

1094
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,610
of conversations of bad girl information

1095
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:50,069
then I'd bring up a bad dab information

1096
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:51,930
and we can't let three people who were

1097
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,360
fronting for the entire community

1098
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:57,059
continue to do that [ __ ] right other

1099
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,950
voices alongside them absolutely so

1100
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,070
that's sort of how this podcast started

1101
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:03,750
at number one ended up to 300 I want to

1102
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,800
drop a clip that goes this is sparta

1103
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:10,329
right now the the accountability piece

1104
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,010
like

1105
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,559
when you told me how many downloads you

1106
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,300
got in February about [ __ ] I was like

1107
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,750
cool I think I've done my last show for

1108
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:22,030
a minute

1109
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:26,230
I kept refreshing that that's a lot of

1110
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:28,540
zeros yeah yeah yeah I do other social

1111
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,880
media and some of what I do

1112
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:34,000
kicks you out viewer metric and that's

1113
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,680
just I never saw this show reaching that

1114
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,760
many people I can't believe you stuck

1115
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,899
with it this long

1116
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,580
like my when I first started I was like

1117
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,809
I'd like to get a hundred episodes and

1118
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:44,619
when I hit a hundred I was like well

1119
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,329
that's easy

1120
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm just getting good at this I felt

1121
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:52,569
comfortable now like around 75 I think

1122
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,369
73 63 ish whichever the uh there's a

1123
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,720
perpetual grow and there's a dry and

1124
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:57,730
cure episode I was like I'm [ __ ]

1125
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,169
positive drag here 36 I've had to look

1126
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,510
it up so many times you're right in the

1127
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,400
rain I was getting a rhythm then and

1128
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,170
then when I got the new intro song and

00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,559
about something then get some dabs going

1180
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:52,000
we've been going for a little bit here

1181
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,789
we can get silly again it took us a

1182
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,250
minute to get back on earth do you have

1183
00:43:54,789 --> 00:44:05,380
a favourite show you've been on keV or a

1184
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:09,280
favorite podcast a moment at the moment

1185
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,869
I asked when we were talking about who

1186
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,790
was on the first episode I got thinking

1187
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,829
about why I knew that offhand and I

1188
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:16,599
recently went back and listened to a

1189
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:18,369
couple of throwbacks and just started

1190
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:19,809
with number one again I kind of feel

1191
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:21,550
like a bag of dicks for not remembering

1192
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:23,949
that you weren't on number one alright

1193
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,780
I'm always here if I've been on more

1194
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:29,679
episodes than any other guest by a mile

1195
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:33,040
44 is preoccupied I think I really liked

1196
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,799
the first one because it was just really

1197
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,920
just informational there's one where you

1198
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,230
guys pretend to be excited about having

1199
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,440
been at the cup when the couple is just

1200
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,608
a brutal experience and there's a minute

1201
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,858
where you're like so we're gonna talk

1202
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:49,059
about the cup next week and then it goes

1203
00:44:47,858 --> 00:44:51,569
into the next show you're like so we

1204
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,570
were at the cup

1205
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,170
big events are challenging there yeah

1206
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:03,519
they are it's fun but it's they are

1207
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,740
theirs we've invented the way to do

1208
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,750
things so much in Colorado but we

1209
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:13,389
haven't got the cannabis consumption

1210
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:15,519
friendly event down - no we [ __ ] it

1211
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:18,190
all up I think the first few events we

1212
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,679
nailed it and then we got legalities

1213
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,780
excuse me we got legalities involved and

1214
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,889
it ruined everything yeah but that has

1215
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,230
to happen at some point

1216
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:28,569
yeah you can't throw a regular party for

1217
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:30,550
more than eight people my thing is those

1218
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,869
events have I don't know how many people

1219
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,030
went remember the candidate the last

1220
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,070
cannabis cup at the expo the small place

1221
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,450
yeah where that traffic jam of people

1222
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,309
happened where you couldn't walk

1223
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:41,588
anywhere they were just stuck you were

1224
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:43,960
like physically stuck was that the one

1225
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:46,269
that got reamed because of the [ __ ]

1226
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,970
huge crash the next year yes that's

1227
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:50,380
exactly yeah those events are

1228
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:51,699
challenging because you have to park

1229
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,369
three miles away

1230
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:56,230
you got a park and then walk with all of

1231
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:57,700
your gear I've got and I'm not trying to

1232
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,139
sound like a [ __ ] but you've got your

1233
00:45:57,699 --> 00:46:00,939
product that your whatever your vending

1234
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:02,469
you've got your product then you've got

1235
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,059
your dab rig you've got whatever else

1236
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,129
you're bringing it's Colorado so you've

1237
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:08,679
got a hat sunglasses a [ __ ] jacket

1238
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,539
like you got layers of clothing because

1239
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,578
it's Colorado you got a backpack it's

1240
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:14,230
just challenging to get from the car to

1241
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:15,940
the thing and then there are so many

1242
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,070
people you got to stand in line forever

1243
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:21,608
then the events are super crowded and

1244
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:23,829
then it's challenging because Kevin and

1245
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:25,869
I have a different approach to the

1246
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,609
events than most consumers we aren't

1247
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,309
your average consumer were there to see

1248
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:32,588
other industry folk and Indian consumers

1249
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:33,969
and this sounds egotistical and it's

1250
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:36,130
weird for me to even think about it this

1251
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:37,689
way but consumers are there to see us a

1252
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,970
little bit they want to come talk to

1253
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,490
Rasta Jeff and I love the social

1254
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:44,559
interaction but after from [ __ ] noon

1255
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,879
to 8:00 at night your voice starts to

1256
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,500
sound like this and you're like will you

1257
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,829
shut up because I want to check my text

1258
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,108
messages and eat a sandwich

1259
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:59,950
throw a big concert or whatever that

1260
00:46:53,108 --> 00:47:02,199
never sounds worth a [ __ ] and every time

1261
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:03,969
I see a cannabis themed concert and like

1262
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,699
I'm a fan of some of the bands that

1263
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:09,608
always do them but I see the line of it

1264
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:12,009
I'm like dafuq why and he's mid 90s

1265
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:14,559
hip-hop ends most of the time it's

1266
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:18,960
already 4/20 can't we just have some

1267
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,960
good music they're getting better like

1268
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,909
they're getting bigger name better acts

1269
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,250
now and there's another event that's

1270
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:32,230

1417
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:57,079
up you created an account you register

1418
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:00,108
your device you put your device in the

1419
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,759

more and you can log in anywhere there

1422
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,799
are other devices like this I'm not

1423
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,180
gonna bash other products there are

1424
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,910
other devices like this that I've talked

1425
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:12,980
about that I've used and they're great

1426
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:15,108
but you can't log in from anywhere and

1427
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,030
view them with the PL gro systems unit I

1428
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,920
can be over at Kem's house and dab it on

1429
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,810
the couch I could be a bit Liberty Point

1430
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,338
eat and launch and I can login and I can

1431
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:25,159
see what's going on to my grow in real

1432
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:26,690
time which for a guy with OCD like me

1433
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:29,299
for a guy that loves his garden like me

1434
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,519
it's really helpful so I think their ad

1435
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,140
is great because it's accurate how many

1436
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,699
times mics get enough to just leave mics

1437
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:36,259

night

1445
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:50,759
and I need them look at the temps and

1446
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:52,919
the humidity and you can make sure

1447

everything's cool in there check the

1448

moist

1450
00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:00,079
if everything's cool we probably hang

1451
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:02,028
out for a little longer then he could

1452

you're awful quiet Oh not bad not bad

1473
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:51,889
and they're funny i watch i watch

1474
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:53,389
youtube videos all the time and you

1475
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:56,298
can't get through like five minutes

1476
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:59,150
without getting an ad it's kind of

1477
00:54:56,298 --> 00:55:00,588
[ __ ] YouTube kind of decides where

1478
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,210
they throw that ad that you I think I

1479
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,219
know but it's all you know it's

1480
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:06,019
frustrating what I hate though is I

1481
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:07,818
watch fish videos at work cuz I'll just

1482
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:09,738
put on YouTube and go type in a fish and

1483
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:11,869
then just let it play fish eye dude fish

1484
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:13,699
plays like 15 minutes song yeah in about

1485
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:16,608
eight minutes is where you get like your

1486
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:19,368
huh and they'll go you'll be like we won

1487
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:20,630
this episode you're like what did what

1488
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:23,059
just happen it's like a tide commercial

1489
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:25,160
with new Tide Pods you like snow [ __ ]

1490
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:27,349
your Tide Pods get out of here happens a

1491
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,759
lot or they die they play on the reggae

1492
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,190
Channel they put McDonalds commercials

1493
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,778
and I'm like that's poorly aimed like

1494
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,729
Rastas aren't gonna go eat McDonald's

1495
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:36,710
it's highly unlikely you should put a

1496
00:55:34,728 --> 00:55:38,058
vitamin cottage or a sprouts commercial

1497
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:42,228
on here or something you might have got

1498
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:46,119
me whoever pays man that's the truth

1499
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:46,118
well I guess you're right

1500
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:54,249

1522
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,710

1523
00:56:56,298 --> 00:57:00,858
drool keV you're just drawing for the

1524
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:03,500

1525
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:06,108
a little Skywalker you got you a torch

1526

00:57:06,108 --> 00:57:15,139
Frank camp bowls glass with the dope rig

1528
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:17,000

1529
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:19,038
three times this thick is anything I've

1530
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,389
owned it's just a super thick version if

1531
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,010
you go to the store and see the super

1532
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:23,389
thick one that's the one Kev's got yeah

1533
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,809
they just had the regular one the last

1534
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:28,338
two times I was shopping I guess yeah

1535
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:30,710
get yourself a bubble cap that's what I

1536
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:34,038
think people have been digging on the

1537
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:36,108
core reactor banger I it doesn't I'm

1538
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:37,940
it's not hot enough for me I take too

1539
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:39,078
big of a dab for it I feel like I know

1540
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,809
people are gonna say that's [ __ ] but

1541
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:44,359
I want my dad's hot it's for cool dabs

1542
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:47,990
it's not designed for a hot dab I do

1543
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:50,960
cool dad yeah it looks like it's for

1544
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:51,618
cool dabs and a large supply for a lotta

1545
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,880
butane

1546
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:54,769
you're supposed to heat this bottom part

1547
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,318
to keep that big piece in there hot yeah

1548
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:59,358
but as soon as your dad hits it it

1549
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:02,358
really cools it off super quickly when

1550
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:04,788
you put a puddle in there I put a big

1551
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:08,630

00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:14,789
reshape itself I think yeah I'm good bro

1583
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,940
I can't keep bugging

1584
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,590
I'm gonna sound like an old guy right

1585
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,210
now but the youngsters change their

1586
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:44,430
names and their handles and their rap

1587
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:48,000
names so quickly that we had to pick one

1588
00:59:44,429 --> 00:59:49,559
and own it well I think he's a youngster

1589
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,659
and it's been an evolution we've got to

1590
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,340
watch him evolve from one version a slop

1591
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:55,589
to the next to what he's become now

1592
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,600
which has been a blessing to watch one

1593
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,070
of your friends go from rapping in the

1594
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,929
basement at Spence and Maddy's I

1595
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:02,100
remember when Maddie was like my buddy

1596
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:03,329

1597
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,400

1606
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,220

1609
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,059

different high it's like 90 something

1626
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,550
percent THC and it really hits you

1627

quickly can mess up a good podcast real

1628
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,580
fast

1629
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:17,070
I haven't soured do sold in a while and

1630
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,869
this is a new gram honestly so I'm not

1631
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:21,750
super familiar with the ride on this

1632
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:25,199
particular gram so I can't say how much

1633
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:28,530
is which but I feel like we need a

1634
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:30,689
project smoked himself and do it do

1635
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:32,010

01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:18,569
that occasionally Mike covered patreon

1649
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:20,460
so that's fun I covered the other ad

1650
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,600
that I talked about though it was good

1651

anything else stand out for you

1656
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:38,490
there were a number of grow episodes

1657
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:39,960
that I remember anticipating like I knew

1658
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:41,689
they were gonna get recorded cuz you

1659
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,980
would tell me like oh so-and-so is

1660
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:46,829
finally emailed me back we're gonna set

1661
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:49,769
up a show - it's gonna get recorded on

1662
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:52,619
Wednesday - it's gonna drop on Monday

1663
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:54,989
- like furiously taking notes because

1664
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,210
that was this step I was gonna be doing

1665
01:02:54,989 --> 01:03:00,118
in a month right like that kind of [ __ ]

1666
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,710
that I really enjoyed in going back and

1667
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,410
listening I got to kind of relive some

1668
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:06,720
of that nice a lot of fun on the show

1669
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:07,949
I've had a lot of fun I've laughed a

1670
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:09,809
couple of times - I've had to stop

1671
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:11,399
recording one of my favorite times now

1672
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:14,460
that I'm thinking about it I smacked my

1673
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,750
elbow on this chair and I turned to get

1674
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,608
up to do something I guess I hit myself

1675
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,469
this week so I was getting to get up and

1676
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:21,088
I hit my funny bone and I was still

1677
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:23,338
recording and I just sat back down I was

1678
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:25,079
like mother I just hit my funny bone I

1679
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:27,299
just talked myself through it and I just

1680
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,309
left the mic on and I put that in the

1681
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,440
podcast and I was like that was kind of

1682
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:32,940
funny there's a some of my favorite

1683
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,909
moments or mistakes I've made a dumb

1684
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:37,200
[ __ ] that I've said and I'm just like

1685
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:39,838
I'm not even gonna edit that whatever

1686
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,579
I'll just keep going because it I've

1687
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:43,739
edited some I've stopped editing that

1688
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:45,690
crap out now because I'm a human and I'm

1689
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:47,459
gonna stutter and stumble and say some

1690
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,650
dumb [ __ ] and I like to show that I'm

1691
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,619
kind of human a little bit when it's to

1692
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:54,150
clean it feels overproduced and if I

1693
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:58,500
wanted that I'd still have an am/fm

1694
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:03,000
radio perfect yeah he'd listen to our

1695
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:05,250
bell probably not that sound like the og

1696
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,260
podcast remember you'd be driving home

1697
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,760
from a concert late at night you might

1698
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,200
he lived in Denver I had to drive

1699
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,210
[ __ ] two-and-a-half hours from Red

1700
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:14,489
Rocks back in the day and the only thing

1701
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:17,010
we didn't have podcasting and [ __ ] back

1702
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:18,299
then I'm old you guys I'm sorry it or I

1703
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:20,130
was on Phish tour I used to travel

1704
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,690
around the country and go see fish from

1705
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,550
place to place and we had a tape deck or

1706
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,750
a radio in the car and once you listen

1707
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,789
to all the tapes in the car you like

1708
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,130
just put on if it's night time if it's

1709
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:31,019
like 10 11 12 o'clock at night cruise

1710
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:32,608
the a.m. channels and find George Noory

1711
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:34,889
and art bell and put on some coast to

1712
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:36,509
coast I feel like that was the og

1713
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:38,848
podcast right there that's kind of where

1714
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,440
that [ __ ] kind of got started I've never

1715
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:41,730
spent enough sound on the road to have

1716
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,010
to go to am

1717
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:49,590
oh man no I just learned a new thing

1718
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:50,610
about you that makes me see different I

1719
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,470
don't think there was that much

1720
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:54,150
difference between the age of my age but

1721
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:56,159
apparently and includes some am

1722
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:59,039
listening in our 20s my brother Bradley

1723
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:01,859
got me addicted to Coast to Coast AM

1724
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,239
radio these guys talk about aliens and

1725
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,160
[ __ ] conspiracies

1726
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:07,109
that's what does it to be you'd be

1727
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:09,420
driving you can get this all across

1728
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:14,610
America yeah yeah you can call in a talk

1729
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:18,570
to women contribute talk about goes

1730
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:21,840
[ __ ] my trips you can always catalog

1731
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:23,700
the tapes or maybe some books on tape no

1732
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,289
we did no I don't like 20 shows a

1733
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,359
widespread panic tour at summer tour

1734
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,920
2001 we needed something to listen to us

1735
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,809
yeah I thought this was all the drugs

1736
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,610
but apparently there was plenty of a.m.

1737
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:35,250
yeah I would imagine the mix the drugs

1738
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:36,990
of a.m. together yeah that's there was a

1739
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:39,110
stirring element I didn't understand

1740
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:41,250
previously and apparently it was

1741
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:45,000
listened to fish all night and then and

1742
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:47,099
radio god it wasn't politics I am so

1743
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,619
into politics it's like semi

1744
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:54,179
embarrassing talk radio is that one

1745
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,809
family member used to love talk radio

1746
01:05:54,179 --> 01:06:00,509
shows about politics on AM radio in it

1747
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:03,299
near at this point in the world and at

1748
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,580
my age I should be way on top of

1749
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:08,250
politics and I would get an F in a

1750
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:11,579
political sciences class right like they

1751
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:14,039
can't you're not alone yeah I'd get a

1752
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:16,139
[ __ ] a in Instagram I'm currently

1753
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,029
watching our city devolve into Obeid

1754
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,639
about a research study that I'm the only

1755
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:23,670
person who's read but there's a lot of

1756
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,559
people trying to debate it so I've given

speech you just gave which I liked by

the way and agree with most of it but

1804
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:21,869
there are a couple of points I'll turn

1805
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:23,548
this podcast right around that's another

1806
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:25,048
thing I should say a lot of people tell

1807
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:29,060
me about how they look forward to Monday

1808
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:34,048
because of my podcast people that have

1809
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:36,120
yeah Monday can kick a person's ass

1810

1812
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:42,210
when people have a [ __ ] up Tuesday

1813
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,660

three to six minutes per artist it's

1905
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:14,720

medicated we are well hydrated I've got

1948
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:40,670
a big fat dab of the taffy the taffy

1949
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:42,199
that ruined Kevin's life I got some of

1950
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:45,199
that on the dabber here I'm gonna heat

1951
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:46,909
up this nail and take a fat dad ruin to

1952
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,769
me we took a little break to get a drink

1953
01:13:46,909 --> 01:13:50,840
we took a break to fix a technical issue

1954
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,640
with the computer and the mic here we

1955
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,770
are back on track as we took a break I

1956
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,630
remembered that I wanted to talk about

1957
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:58,880
the strain episodes that we've been

1958
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,369
doing those are a lot of fun I was

1959
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,680
mentioning how much fun I have I felt

1960
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:05,809
that it would be very egotistical to go

1961
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,700
online and do a podcast about something

1962
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:09,800
that I bred and hype up my own [ __ ] that

1963
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:12,500
felt kind of weird but once I did it

1964
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,909
everybody responded so well ah those are

1965
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,260
a lot of fun you guys I have a lot of

1966
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:17,539
fun doing those so look forward to more

1967
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,500
of the strain report episodes coming

1968
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:19,819
from me I'm not gonna do them too

1969
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,180
frequently cuz I'll run out of them

1970
01:14:19,819 --> 01:14:24,769
there's only so many to do but maybe as

1971
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:27,200
they create more I can try to catch up

1972
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:29,140
and do backlogs and stuff but yeah the

1973
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,279
strain reports those have been a lot of

1974
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:33,440
fun Mike I'm gonna take a dab will you

1975
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:35,989
ramble for me I'm trying

1976
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,809
what what strand reports coming next

1977
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:40,039
what we got to look forward to ah I just

1978
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,370
did once I haven't planned the next one

1979
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:44,600
yet

1980
01:14:40,369 --> 01:14:46,699
good times keV what are you looking for

1981
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:53,260
with the podcast over the next hundred

1982
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:53,260
episodes I mean just a continuation of

1983
01:14:55,899 --> 01:15:05,509
because I'm not really a grower per se

1984
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:07,130
so I'm curious too I don't know where it

1985
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:10,520
can go for where it needs to go from

1986
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:13,489
here I think what he's doing is spot-on

1987
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:15,410
I like letting the thing I'm hoping to

1988
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:17,349
see is more guests I don't think I'm

1989
01:15:15,409 --> 01:15:19,760
alone there and I don't mean more me

1990
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,890
right there's more people it's hard it's

1991
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,820
it is hard we need to find a better way

1992
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:28,880
to do guests like well we need a studio

1993
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:31,069
that's better located yeah being in

1994
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,630
Puebla is rough you tell people pueblos

1995
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:34,909
and they take two steps back and check

1996
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:36,770
for their wallet like attend them to

1997
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:38,840
come down here like now including this

1998
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:41,420
private neighborhood I can go to places

1999
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,130
it's just I'm consumed by the current

2000
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:46,430
project we're working on

2001
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:48,140
that's got me overloaded and sometimes

2002
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:50,420
I'm not sure when I'm gonna get to

2003
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:52,400
record who's got a everybody I want you

2004
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:56,180
to get on the show that's also true for

2005
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:58,429
ya so no I know I know why it is like it

2006
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,350
is so I was gonna say I just like

2007
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:03,740
letting the show kind of evolve I do

2008
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:06,560
have plans and ideas but it's doing its

2009
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:08,119
thing perfectly you know I'm not gonna

2010
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,270
take too many sponsors so you won't get

2011
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:13,369
too many ads oh we support the holiday

2012
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,750
theme company or who the vendors are

2013
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:17,599
because that's kind of a symbiotic

2014
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:19,939
relationship there I always plan to

2015
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,920
share what I'm smoking on stay honest

2016
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:24,589
keep the people up to date and one thing

2017
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,050
I've noticed is in early episodes I had

2018
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:29,600
different ideas on some things I've said

2019
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:31,610
do full your feet do not follow your

2020
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,680
feet do follow your feet okay now do

2021
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:35,509
follow your feed now don't like I've

2022
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,240
changed my opinion an idea and I'm glad

2023
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:40,039
that people have still respected me

2024
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,809
because I've changed my opinion I'm

2025
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:43,609
gonna keep doing that I'm gonna keep

2026
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,380
giving the most updated advice that I

2027
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:46,939
can give when I learn more and I'm not

2028
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:49,400
gonna I'm gonna try to not be too

2029
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:51,529
prideful and too egotistical to say hey

2030
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:52,489
I've changed my idea now this is the way

2031
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:54,050
I would do it now because there are

2032
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:55,609
things I'm doing way differently now

2033
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,590
and I have ever done before that's

2034
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:59,929
that's a big part of the reason I think

2035
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:02,180
you're the level of grower that you are

2036
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:03,680
is because you didn't learn away and

2037
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,530
then sweep to it I watched so many

2038
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:09,320
people fall into that rut like sort of

2039
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:10,699
like it was a cookie recipe and then

2040
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:12,439
they would struggle with different

2041
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:15,199
genetics because it didn't like to

2042
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:17,839
follow the recipe right um and just

2043
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,699
watching you learn several different

2044
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,159
systems over the years has been fun I

2045
01:17:19,699 --> 01:17:25,389
mean it shows in the herb I've managed

2046
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:27,769
three large commercial facilities ah

2047
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:29,900
technically two because one wasn't very

2048
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:32,030
functional I left because it wasn't

2049
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:38,029
functional I've managed three large

2050
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:40,899
facilities and I've ran countless small

2051
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:43,539
home grows and I've consulted on

2052
01:17:40,899 --> 01:17:46,369
hundreds of home grows

2053
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:49,130
yep I've been in enough grows I've ran

2054
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:51,739
so many plants bit I was doing the math

2055
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:53,909
on it I think last year

2056
01:17:51,739 --> 01:18:00,750
they threaten to kill people for the

2057
01:17:53,909 --> 01:18:03,090
number you bout to say politics but

2058
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:05,520
mister are you saw that story yeah I

2059
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:07,529
brought it up in front you are trying to

2060
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,000
kill us for having too many plants yes

2061
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:11,039
the numbers are large it's not like

2062
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,180
anything you've got don't worry but the

2063
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:17,760
past where you live in like how many

2064
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:19,260
pounds and we can disclose this number

2065
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,310
how many pounds last year do you think

2066
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:25,310
our production facility produced many

2067
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:27,300
pounds of cannabis we produced last year

2068
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:29,670
out of that facility

2069
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:31,980
whenever I see on the news that like

2070
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:33,630
they busted a house and it had this many

2071
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:34,829
plants and it had this many pounds and

2072
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:36,930
it's worth this many millions of dollars

2073
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:38,250
I always convert that to like the

2074
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:40,230
product that went through the room that

2075
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:42,810
day right in chuckle so there was that

2076
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:44,429
approximately we're gonna say 700 pounds

2077
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:47,550
of cannabis plus however many pounds of

2078
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:50,360
trim in one year in my first year at a

2079
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:52,800
facility I ran another facility for

2080
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:56,849
approximately a year and my first

2081
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:59,070
harvest there was 321 pounds so I've

2082
01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:02,120
produced over a thousand pounds of

2083
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:02,119
cannabis in two years

2084
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:09,498
fair I'd like to say I've got a little

2085
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:12,769
bit of experience right and then in the

2086
01:19:09,498 --> 01:19:15,019
process to learning too that I only post

2087
01:19:12,769 --> 01:19:16,699
my good pictures to Instagram I post my

2088
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:19,610
successes the way that I learned the

2089
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:23,478
most was my fuck-ups I would if I had 10

2090
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:26,839
close to teachers Mike saw me grow buds

2091
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:29,479
that were the size of NFL footballs

2092
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,380
stacked on top of each other but when we

2093
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:32,510
cut him up the middle

2094
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:35,538
they were moldy it was an 11 ounce plan

2095
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:38,659
all moldy up the middle white rhino buds

2096
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:40,779
the seriously properly inflated NFL

2097
01:19:38,658 --> 01:19:43,098
football it was gorgeous

2098
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:44,748
Kevin looked at me like oh you got junk

2099
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:46,788
no and that's when I stopped when I

2100
01:19:44,748 --> 01:19:49,938
stopped literally shopping with any

2101
01:19:46,788 --> 01:19:51,738
other provider caregiver was the day I

2102
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:53,389
saw you take that find it throw the

2103
01:19:51,738 --> 01:19:54,918
entire thing in the trash bag and go

2104
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:57,859
that that wasn't [ __ ] with that it

2105
01:19:54,918 --> 01:19:59,448
was all moldy but but no I wanted other

2106
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:01,639
places where people will like cut around

2107
01:19:59,448 --> 01:20:04,938
it but now I know not to grow football

2108
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:06,050
sized butts I have I have taken plants

2109
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:07,999
and fed them

2110
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:09,590
oh it says to give it 50 mils of this I

2111
01:20:07,998 --> 01:20:11,868
give it a hundred and see what happens

2112
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:13,519
and done that like we have done

2113
01:20:11,868 --> 01:20:15,889
everything we can to torture a plant on

2114
01:20:13,519 --> 01:20:18,469
purpose here that's kind of that's how I

2115
01:20:15,889 --> 01:20:21,168
have gotten good I wasn't afraid if I

2116
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:23,059
had 10 plants I only need 9 to finish I

2117
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:24,380
got one I can experiment with so if I

2118
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:26,239
was gonna do something weird just pick

2119
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:28,159
one and pick an experiment for this grow

2120
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,828
and if it dies you got none you only

2121
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,598
only plan on living 9 only fun on having

2122
01:20:30,828 --> 01:20:35,238
9 live to the end be ready to kill one

2123
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:36,619
play with it the best thing about your

2124
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:39,078
crop of weed that you're growing right

2125
01:20:36,618 --> 01:20:41,708
now is it's not the last crop of weed

2126
01:20:39,078 --> 01:20:46,009
that you're gonna grow God willing I

2127
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:47,538
have some faith most of us are able to

2128
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:49,070
grow again most of us are like we're in

2129
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:50,898
Colorado most of a lot of people in

2130
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:52,158
California Oregon a lot of people are

2131
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:52,699
gonna be smart they're gonna follow the

2132
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:54,018
rules

2133
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:56,868
now they're gonna be the screener be

2134
01:20:54,019 --> 01:20:58,668
careful right now the markets changing

2135
01:20:56,868 --> 01:21:01,069
really fast and as it changes

2136
01:20:58,668 --> 01:21:03,738
who's doing the growing this changing

2137
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:05,359
very true very true there was a thing

2138
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:08,418
that came through here when legalization

2139
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,498
when medical happened everybody went to

2140
01:21:08,418 --> 01:21:11,769
the gross torn I bought a grow light

2141
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:14,158
mm-hmm then a year and a half later

2142
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:16,170
Craigslist and

2143
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,569
yeah nothing but grow lights everybody

2144
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:20,279
had gross [ __ ] for sale because they all

2145
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:21,750
buy all the fancy equipment that the

2146
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:23,309
gross store will sell you and they say

2147
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:25,260
go do this and you'll be able to grow

2148
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:26,280
and they go home and they can't grow for

2149
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,929
[ __ ] because they didn't listen to a

2150
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:29,579
podcast I didn't buy books they didn't

2151
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:32,670
do their homework but they don't realize

2152
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:34,979
that it's that it's like getting help

2153
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:36,449
that has me when people ask me like what

2154
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:38,339
what's the most important thing I can

2155
01:21:36,448 --> 01:21:41,369
have in a grow I'm like the [ __ ] book

2156
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:43,139
yeah like it's a hundred percent the

2157
01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:44,849
knowledge some time and dedication it's

2158
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:46,500
not just gonna be walking there once a

2159

2163
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:58,169

2164
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,789
size of a kitchen table is smaller and I

2165
01:21:58,170 --> 01:22:02,310
need to be able to just look at it once

2166
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:05,760
or twice a month and I'm like then go to

2167
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:08,039

2169
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,899
love for the plant those guys have a

2170
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:15,000
micro grow master a camo micro grow

2171
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:18,179
there's three beautiful micro grows but

2172
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,069
like it's the hands-off ignore it

2173
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:22,260
component that I don't understand at all

2174
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:23,939
yeah no matter how much monitoring an

2175
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,110
auto shoot you have you have to be there

2176
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:27,059
you have to know if there's a spider

2177
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:29,460
mite if there's powdery mildew you have

2178
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:31,350
to defoliate you have to put trellis up

2179
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:34,408
you have to work the canopy into the

2180
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:36,300
trellis I like to pop the stems I just

2181
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:38,729
call it popping them I grab them I would

2182
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,840
grab here and I'd grab here I guess

2183
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:41,759
that's about a half an inch of space

2184
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,429
between my fingers and turn and it goes

2185
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,170
it makes that noise I like to break all

2186
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:48,060
the plows start there sound effect and

2187
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,710
work my way all the way up the plant and

2188
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,810
then I'll start with the lowest branch

2189
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,399
and work up each branch every branch

2190
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,500
gets all popped all the way up about

2191
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:57,000
every four to six inches apart I'll pop

2192
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,250
each plant a hundred times if it's a

2193
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,198
decent sized plant pop pop pop pop pop

2194
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:03,600
will leave there with our hands bucket

2195
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,678
looking all calloused up on pop day but

2196
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,210
there's work to do every day

2197
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:08,250
you got a trellis imp you got to pop

2198
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:09,630
them make sure everything's working if

2199
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,010
you got an auto water system how do you

2200
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,750
know an emitter isn't clogged we get

2201
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:14,789
clogged emitters we get clogged filters

2202
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:17,520
pumps burn out [ __ ] goes wrong

2203
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:19,948
fans burn out molto helps burn out yeah

2204
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,480
light bulbs never burn out at the end or

2205
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:23,819
beginning of a cycle it's always about

2206
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:26,038
week six when everything's big emotion

2207
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:28,738
[ __ ] obnoxious and you got a move

2209
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:34,259
wrong oh and it needs that attention

2210
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:37,500
every time I've seen somebody try to do

2211
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:41,130
I mean even like a four day vacation I

2212
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:42,658
bet it's just everybody gets tackled why

2213

don't you go do this and I'm like are

2214
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:47,368
you gonna come here and take care of the

2215
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:48,689
plants there was the old video that I

2216
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:51,479
saw on YouTube and I'm pretty sure it

2217
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:53,488
was so cool in his first sentence to the

2218
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:57,388
crowd is shut up we all have to get home

2219
01:23:53,488 --> 01:23:58,828
in a day and a half the entire room they

2220
01:23:57,389 --> 01:24:01,618
didn't even laugh they just went clip

2221
01:23:58,828 --> 01:24:03,210
yep because all of them immediately got

2222
01:24:01,618 --> 01:24:05,368
the joke understood why it was made

2223
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,868
realized it was true for them too and

2224
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:09,569
wanted to hear what the man had to say

2225
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:12,899
yep because just when you're in charge

2226
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:15,538
of a crop every time you shut that door

2227
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:17,129
the clock starts it's like well Mike and

2228
01:24:15,538 --> 01:24:19,229
I run a large facility when we drive

2229
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:20,969
away I look in the rearview mirror like

2230
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:22,379
is anything on fire is there any smoke

2231
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:23,969
coming out so I've only got like 12

2232
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,639
hours to leave here before [ __ ] starts

2233
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:28,859
going wrong and we come home and record

2234
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,599
a podcast and go take care of our family

2235
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,979
life take a poop of shower and some food

2236
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:35,578
get back there make sure nothing went

2237
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:37,529
wrong when it's on that scale and it's

2238
01:24:35,578 --> 01:24:39,448
not like other industries where they've

2239
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:41,429
been doing it for a hundred years and so

2240
01:24:39,448 --> 01:24:45,569
the industrial version of what you need

2241
01:24:41,429 --> 01:24:47,340
is time tested and and updated and so a

2242
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:50,819
lot of our [ __ ] we have to do on our own

2243
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:53,670
and it the start of every day is go find

2244
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:55,679
a little broke and most days nothing

2245
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:59,190
broke but the day you don't check

2246
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:01,859
everything broke everything yep you

2247
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:05,098
gotta see how it goes in and I watched

2248
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:06,658
family members that grew every time they

2249
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:08,699
would come up to Denver and visit for a

2250
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:10,348
day and a half their [ __ ] would die and

2251
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:12,149
so it got to the point where we were

2252
01:25:10,349 --> 01:25:14,788
like hey we've got tickets to a game and

2253
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:16,888
they were like [ __ ] off every time I

2254
01:25:14,788 --> 01:25:19,319
come up and visit for two days I come

2255
01:25:16,889 --> 01:25:21,000
home but no livelihood and I have to

2256
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,009
start from scratch it's why people don't

2257
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,840
realize they got to give me like a solid

2258
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:26,670
week in advance if you want me to do

2259
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,319
something Saturday you should have hit

2260
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:30,389
me up last Saturday because I have to

2261
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:32,639
get the plants on the right rhythm to be

2262
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:33,650
gone overnight Saturday because if I

2263
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:35,659

2264
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:37,159
and I can't water I'm Saturday before I

2265
01:25:35,659 --> 01:25:38,659
leave because then they're gonna be too

2266
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:39,949
wet I got a water I'm right before I

2267
01:25:38,659 --> 01:25:42,050
leave for whatever we're doing Saturday

2268
01:25:39,949 --> 01:25:43,489
night got a water we're gonna be gone

2269
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,140
overnight Saturday gonna leave in like

2270
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:46,819
noon Saturday and then get in the car

2271
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,530
and [ __ ] go so I can be back Sunday

2272
01:25:46,819 --> 01:25:51,199
before they start getting to drive in

2273
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:52,880
that with that's what makes me ripping

2274
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,609
in my hair every time I hear somebody

2275
01:25:52,880 --> 01:26:03,920
like well it's just wheat anyone grow it

2276
01:25:54,609 --> 01:26:06,109
and I'm like no people tell me that just

2277
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,050
try to force me to grow weed because

2278
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:13,699
everyone I'm like no I can't

2279
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:15,770
yeah anyone can also make hash bro I've

2280
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:17,809
run into this at every level from like

2281
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:21,320
serious business owners that have

2282
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:24,140
invested millions - newspaper reporters

2283
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:27,679
and city officials and police and

2284
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:30,680
friends and it's just oh it's easy

2285
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,810
anybody can grow weed and it's know like

2286
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,940
it's an acquired skill that takes years

2287
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:37,430
and years and years of training to even

2288
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:39,949
get close anyone can do grow weed but I

2289
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:41,240
mean depends on what your target is it a

2290
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:43,550
lot of people are just growing weed at

2291
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:47,630
home do it and they're throwing some

2292
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:48,829
light they got a an affordable light and

2293
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:50,390
they're doing it they're satisfied with

2294
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:54,619
the product which that makes me happy

2295
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:56,600
but to grow to make a profit or product

2296
01:26:54,619 --> 01:26:58,819
on a commercial level on a reliable

2297
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,860
scale that's when you start getting into

2298
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:03,349
a lot of nuances if you want to figure

2299
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:05,210
out dial in a strains nuances and trying

2300
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:07,310
to your things properly like anybody can

2301
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:09,020
just throw some seed or a clone in there

2302
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,430
and they can make it happen and if

2303
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,900
they're satisfied with that that's cool

2304
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:13,610
I'm proud of them and I want them to

2305
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,869
smoke that and love it but if you want

2306
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:16,279
to take it to the next level it's gonna

2307
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:19,550
take some skill it's gonna take some

2308
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:22,689
learn it's it you can teach I would say

2309
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:25,670
can teach probably 60 to 70% of this but

2310
01:27:22,689 --> 01:27:26,539
40 to 30 to 40% you're gonna have to eat

2311
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,890
beside me

2312
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:29,689
every day for a couple of weeks to

2313
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:31,700
figure it out like there's [ __ ] that I

2314
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:34,189
can't even teach you through this

2315
01:27:31,699 --> 01:27:36,109
podcast through a video you got to come

2316
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:37,849
touch the plants a trade more than an

2317
01:27:36,109 --> 01:27:41,029
equation yeah yeah you're gonna have to

2318
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:42,800
look like to tell you how much exactly I

2319
01:27:41,029 --> 01:27:44,119
want to foliated we have to stand back

2320
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,820
from the room and I have to show you

2321
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:49,010
like the whole room instead of one small

2322
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:50,479
section and then I'm like I know it's my

2323
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:52,960
view of aggro is way different from

2324
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:55,339
other people's I think it's fun like

2325
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,710
teaching new people how to do it our

2326
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:59,600
scale because you don't especially with

2327
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,130
that task it's not something you can see

2328
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,920
until you're done with it I have to

2329
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:06,230
teach people say we're defoliating a

2330
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:10,220
table we've got our average for average

2331
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:12,319
room so room a is 40 lights room a is 40

2332
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:14,960
lights and it would take two or three

2333
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:17,630
dudes an entire day to properly do

2334
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,949
foliate for a week to defoliation the

2335
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:22,190
way that I want it for proper light

2336
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:23,809
penetration if we put the right people

2337
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:26,000
in there if we put the wrong people

2338
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:28,100
there don't tell him to move around it

2339
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,750
would take four hours to do fully one

2340
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,550
section really heavily and the rest of

2341
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:33,109
the Grove would just be leafy so I've

2342
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:35,630
got to tell him to listen to a song and

2343
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:37,279
every song move to another table listen

2344
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:38,810
to a song and every song move to another

2345
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,159
table because they're not used to such a

2346
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:43,100
large growth they think they're gonna go

2347
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:46,309
in there and defoliate that room left to

2348
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:49,039
right yeah and I tell them like just

2349
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:50,990
walk around the table like just kind of

2350
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:53,720
always be shuffling up into the layers

2351
01:28:50,989 --> 01:28:55,189
right and just work your way like a

2352
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,510
typewriter dude you're eating a piece of

2353
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:58,939
corn yeah I don't want

2354
01:28:56,510 --> 01:29:01,340
Table one to be naked and Table three to

2355
01:28:58,939 --> 01:29:03,859
be super furry so just start give me a

2356
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:05,239
level one manicure a level to a level

2357
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:06,979
three and just work your way back and

2358
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:08,029
forth it's hard to get people yeah

2359
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:09,019
because they think they're gonna go in

2360
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:10,789
there just like their home grow that's

2361
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:13,730
one light I can leave this in like an

2362
01:29:10,789 --> 01:29:14,960
hour there are 40 lights in here if it

2363
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:16,519
takes you an hour to do the one at home

2364
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,949
that's 40 in here Plus these are much

2365
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:21,470
beefier plants cuz we got kavita's and

2366
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:22,250
curve oh [ __ ] it charge really tall

2367
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:25,369
ceilings

2368
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:27,560
yeah ridiculous HVAC and Rasta Jeff Tech

2369
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:29,090
and trellising all day so they're beefy

2370
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,920
plants in there it's gonna take you

2371
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:32,319
quite a while to reach in and trellis

2372
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,420
all that [ __ ] that middle

2373
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,609
it's hard for me to reach I'm six five

2374
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:38,289
gonna let imagine what it's like for the

2375
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:40,029
unresponsible prototypes the bottom I

2376
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:45,340
know how are their reach is that why

2377
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:49,840
they're in the dirt yep only only metric

2378
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:51,489
[ __ ] Oh God only metric certified

2379
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,050
people know why that's funny all mics my

2380
01:29:51,489 --> 01:29:55,329
tags are in the dirt you guys plan on

2381
01:29:53,050 --> 01:30:01,840
all you [ __ ] plants are [ __ ] three

2382
01:29:55,329 --> 01:30:09,670
feet tall the tags not a happy place to

2383
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:12,250
be so if you work in a metric regulated

2384
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:14,619
facility wherever metrics in like

2385
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:16,390
Washington and Colorado most legal

2386
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:17,920
states have adopted it so if you work

2387
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:20,440
with metric and you've got those stupid

2388
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,180
[ __ ] metric plant tags that are

2389
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:24,399
supposed to be affixed in such a stupid

2390
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,960
way I'd find that to be obnoxious I wish

2391
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:27,699
it would hang so that I could read the

2392
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:30,670
tag instead of have it anyhow

2393
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:32,380
ah here's a thing for you to do I had

2394
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:41,739
somebody helpfully recommend we do it

2395
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:45,000
the other way walk find your metric or a

2396
01:30:41,739 --> 01:30:47,649
compliance person mike is my personal

2397
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,420
[ __ ] this is really funny this is really

2398
01:30:47,649 --> 01:30:51,699
funny I want you to walk walk out of a

2399
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:53,199
grill room with a perplexed look on your

2400
01:30:51,699 --> 01:30:54,039
face most of you have it already because

2401
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,329
you've been in the girl room and even

2402
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:57,699
smoking dads will [ __ ] date and the

2403
01:30:55,329 --> 01:30:59,229
lights are brighter like huh find your

2404
01:30:57,699 --> 01:31:01,720
compliance person or your metric person

2405
01:30:59,229 --> 01:31:03,519
and walk up to them and say hey why

2406
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:08,730
don't any of the plants in room a have

2407
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:12,970
tags on them and just don't say that you

2408
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:14,829
know so all what if they like they're

2409
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:16,090
like five things that have to absolutely

2410
01:31:14,829 --> 01:31:18,039
happen in a girl you have to have a

2411
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:20,860
badge on if you don't have a badge on

2412
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:22,689
you gonna know numero uno ya gotta have

2413
01:31:20,859 --> 01:31:24,250
a visible badge above the waist at all

2414
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:27,579
times these are either a visit I feel

2415
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:29,140
weird right that I can see it like

2416
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:31,899
that's how close I keep that badge when

2417
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:33,490
I go if I leave if I leave I take it

2418
01:31:31,899 --> 01:31:35,469
with me if I go to other dispensaries to

2419
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:36,880
shop I take it with me because often

2420
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,960
times you can get a tour if you're me

2421
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,819
and they're like you got your badge like

2422
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,840
yeah come on back like if you don't have

2423
01:31:39,819 --> 01:31:43,029
it you're [ __ ] you just missed your

2424
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:44,560
chance for a tour but it brings

2425
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:45,389
opportunities sometimes and you also get

2426
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,700
a discount

2427
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:51,030
in the industry but number one you got

2428
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:52,679
to have a badge number two where am I

2429
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:55,229
getting plant tags like number two or

2430
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:58,470
number three is every plant has to

2431
01:31:55,229 --> 01:32:00,899
Colorado pretty much - as plant tags

2432
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:05,119
yeah you got to have a black tag maybe

2433
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:07,199
badge license on the wall plant tags but

2434
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,640
waste accountability you gotta weigh the

2435
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:11,250
[ __ ] waste yeah that's things that

2436
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:13,740
people [ __ ] up on all the time we just

2437
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:16,710
listed both components of my job yeah

2438
01:32:13,739 --> 01:32:18,659
yeah keep track of plant tags and making

2439
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:20,250
sure all the waste and then and then

2440
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:22,559
Mike does all the weighing and packaging

2441
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:24,119
and it's like yeah like 99 percent of my

2442
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,590
job is first part that people would be

2443
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:26,939
like man I just want to go wait weed all

2444
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:29,369
day Mike's like I gotta weigh the

2445
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:31,229
[ __ ] weed all day like it's literally

2446
01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:32,970
that's what I'm doing all day tomorrow

2447
01:32:31,229 --> 01:32:34,739
for eight hours I will be putting weed

2448
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:37,350
on a scale and writing numbers down yeah

2449
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:39,149
absolutely for eight straight hours but

2450
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:41,550
the number two thing is those plants

2451
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:44,099
have to have a tag when I cut a clone

2452
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:46,050
off of a plant I have to find that tag

2453
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:48,539
and write the strain name onto a piece

2454
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:50,850
of paper the mother plant that tag

2455
01:32:48,539 --> 01:32:52,619
number that the clone came from and then

2456
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:54,539
how many clones came off of it and the

2457
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:57,359
date and then that sticker has to go

2458
01:32:54,539 --> 01:33:00,600
with my clones at all times then once

2459
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:01,920
those clones are put into a medium of

2460
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,020
anything they come out of an EZ cloner

2461
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,060
once they're rooted Mike has to

2462
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:07,770
immediately take this Lippman list is

2463
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,600
made when the clones are cut goes into

2464
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,950
the computer as clones as soon as

2465
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,020
they're put into dirt Mike moves them

2466
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:14,880
into another section the computer called

2467
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,850
vegetative stage and then they get these

2468
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,369
tags every single one of them has to

2469
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:22,470
have a tag Mike Lohner holds a hundred

2470
01:33:20,369 --> 01:33:23,970
and eighty clones and for those of you

2471
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:26,610
who don't know about this particular

2472
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:27,390
task in detail each tag has to be filled

2473
01:33:26,609 --> 01:33:30,599
out by hand

2474
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:33,690
so Mike writes chem for chem for chem

2475
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:35,789
for chem for chem for chem for I do

2476
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:37,409
about 40 clones of each stream because I

2477
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:39,090
want to fill the rooms with chunks you

2478
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:40,829
know this seems to be the Simpsons were

2479
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:43,529
parts at the chalkboard I never

2480
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:45,059
understood how much that skill like in

2481
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:48,000
grade school would come in handy later

2482
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:49,740
in life I was I was that kid I did it is

2483
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,409
Matt but now it's like [ __ ] Sour

2484
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:52,639
Diesel Sour Diesel Sour Diesel

2485
01:33:51,409 --> 01:33:54,828
[Music]

2486
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,389
my favorite is uh when you write gorilla

2487
01:33:54,828 --> 01:33:59,328
glue and nobody can read what the [ __ ]

2488
01:33:56,389 --> 01:34:03,349
it says yeah golden goat we like what is

2489
01:33:59,328 --> 01:34:04,819
soldier cloak what a soldier cloak we do

2490
01:34:03,349 --> 01:34:06,078
we get some new genetics here no we just

2491
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:08,118
got an [ __ ] they can't [ __ ] right

2492
01:34:06,078 --> 01:34:10,549
you got it right and sharpie and if you

2493
01:34:08,118 --> 01:34:12,198
use a fine point it's not legible unless

2494
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:14,179
you've got the tag pressed to your face

2495
01:34:12,198 --> 01:34:15,469
which is fun cuz sometimes they fall

2496
01:34:14,179 --> 01:34:17,149
into the dirt which is covered with

2497
01:34:15,469 --> 01:34:19,908
nutrients and sometimes they get sprayed

2498
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:21,229
with sprays which are full of sprays so

2499
01:34:19,908 --> 01:34:22,578
you don't want that [ __ ] in your face so

2500
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:24,828
you gotta use the fat Sharpie which

2501
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:27,139
[ __ ] dolls after like to cook to

2502
01:34:24,828 --> 01:34:28,789
tanks so you wind up [ __ ] right with

2503
01:34:27,139 --> 01:34:30,349
like a goddamn paint brush and I can't

2504
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:32,389
write for [ __ ] to begin with in my

2505
01:34:30,349 --> 01:34:36,260
[ __ ] y'all don't even get me started

2506
01:34:32,389 --> 01:34:38,179
Jeff too late I like it anybody who

2507
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:40,190
fills up that tags is 100% with me

2508
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:42,319
promise to you thanks for joining

2509
01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:44,388
why don't we get you see the labels I've

2510
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:45,590
got over there bro like for my for that

2511
01:34:44,389 --> 01:34:47,389
those labels they come out of that

2512
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:49,250
normal printer not compliant from what I

2513
01:34:47,389 --> 01:34:51,139
understand we can't just print those and

2514
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:54,948
stick them onto that pretty sure the

2515
01:34:51,139 --> 01:34:56,539
stick is non-compliance s might be cuz

2516
01:34:54,948 --> 01:35:00,259
the stuff that's written on the front of

2517
01:34:56,539 --> 01:35:02,448
that in the back of it like I'm I would

2518
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:04,190
have to talk to someone above me about

2519
01:35:02,448 --> 01:35:06,289
that okay I've never seen another

2520
01:35:04,189 --> 01:35:07,939
facility do that so my idea may be

2521
01:35:06,289 --> 01:35:10,399
non-compliant you may be correct because

2522
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:12,289
we could just buy the printer in the

2523
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,479
right tag my guess is that anything you

2524
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:16,760
stick isn't gonna hold right because of

2525
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:18,439
the wet and moist just yeah now they

2526
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,880
make plastic ones it'll be perfect or we

2527
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:22,098
stick them on the outside of the [ __ ]

2528
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:25,069
plan either way either way I'm cool with

2529
01:35:22,099 --> 01:35:26,300
it metric tags go in there walk out of

2530
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:28,158
the room with this look on your face

2531
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,869
like what the hell happened then walk up

2532
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:31,189
to your compliance person metric person

2533
01:35:29,868 --> 01:35:33,738
and say what happened all the tags in

2534
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:35,539
beanie and they're gonna have a little

2535
01:35:33,738 --> 01:35:39,948
they might pee themselves just a touch

2536
01:35:35,539 --> 01:35:41,238
just depending on their anxiety level at

2537
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,948
the moment they might pee themselves a

2538
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:45,500
lot depending on how long metric has

2539
01:35:42,948 --> 01:35:47,238
been spinning around likes to give you

2540
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,559
the wheel of death you try to use metric

2541
01:35:47,238 --> 01:35:50,178
and it just shows you on the screen just

2542
01:35:48,559 --> 01:35:54,139
spins the cursor just goes mmmm not

2543
01:35:50,179 --> 01:35:56,000
today [ __ ] it always happens it

2544
01:35:54,139 --> 01:35:57,559
nine times out of ten metric will freeze

2545
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,420
when you've got a delivery driver

2546
01:35:57,559 --> 01:36:01,219
waiting to pick up and you're just

2547
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,630
waiting to print the manifest because I

2548
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:04,880
know people would say why don't you

2549
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,680
print it before they come because if you

2550
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,810
put a driver

2551
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,610
and a car license plate on a manifest in

2552
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:10,840
print it I [ __ ] promise you a

2553
01:36:09,609 --> 01:36:12,369
different driver and a different car

2554
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,710
will show up one of the two will not be

2555
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:17,470
every time and you have to reprint you

2556
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:19,180
cannot it's it's a Colorado regulated

2557
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:20,680
thing after reprint you can't wait it

2558
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:22,060
out or if it's gotta go back to the

2559
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,140
internet you got to adjust it in the

2560
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,730
Internet then you got a permanence you

2561
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:26,230
just wait from the show up because if

2562
01:36:24,729 --> 01:36:27,939
they say Kevin's come in at 4:00 in a

2563
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:31,059
Honda I guaran-fucking-tee you Mike

2564
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:32,349
showing up at 5:00 in a Nissan that's

2565
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:35,200
[ __ ] the medical marijuana industry

2566
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:38,800
that's how it goes no it's gotten better

2567
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:40,149
but yeah we've got some drivers that are

2568
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,680
actually pretty punctual and we pissed

2569
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:43,059
them off because we take a long time and

2570
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,860
actually I like it when they're on time

2571
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,900
and stuff it looks much better for this

2572
01:36:44,859 --> 01:36:48,489
industry then one dude shows up way

2573
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:50,979
early and that ain't cool the other dude

2574
01:36:48,489 --> 01:36:54,369
same time every week every day every

2575

01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:26,920
equipment when I see that look in that

2589
01:37:23,229 --> 01:37:28,599
van I'm a good person but I start

2590
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,130
thinking like some [ __ ] Ocean's

2591
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,829
thirteen [ __ ] how to give that [ __ ]

2592
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:34,630
van in my garage like and you guys

2593
01:37:32,829 --> 01:37:36,309
you're kind of you're totally

2594
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:38,920
identifying who you are and what you're

2595
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:41,260
doing this is it's legal now

2596
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,670
yes but [ __ ] are still

2597
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,930
[ __ ] you don't have to worry

2598
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:47,170
about the police but you have to worry

2599
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:48,280
about thieves and be safe please I know

2600
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:49,239
that sounds like the old man just preach

2601
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,069
to you but when you're all worked out

2602
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:54,189
and that Sprinter van I know what you

2603
01:37:51,069 --> 01:37:55,569
got and I'm a good person but that

2604
01:37:54,189 --> 01:37:57,909
doesn't mean that everybody who has made

2605
01:37:55,569 --> 01:38:00,969
that correlation cuz you see you see him

2606
01:37:57,909 --> 01:38:03,250
in Denver in the right lane lost his

2607
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:05,740
[ __ ] looking at their GPS going where's

2608
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:07,689
live well and just [ __ ] there's

2609
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:09,699
driving a Sprinter van dreadlocks and

2610
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:11,139
[ __ ] hat pins and a hoodie [ __ ]

2611
01:38:09,699 --> 01:38:13,449
leaned up over the steering wheel high

2612
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:14,740
as [ __ ] like you guy can spot him I've

2613
01:38:13,449 --> 01:38:17,470
seen a couple of them when I've been out

2614
01:38:14,739 --> 01:38:18,698
I Drive dinner frequently and you got

2615
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:20,409
the Sprinter van

2616
01:38:18,698 --> 01:38:22,750
with the [ __ ] refrigeration in the

2617
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:27,130
back so you got concentrates or you're

2618
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:28,779
picking up and it's obvious and you're

2619
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:30,489
not an armored truck and you've got more

2620
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:32,590
[ __ ] in you than an armored truck would

2621
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:34,089
we kind of keep that in mind you guys

2622
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:35,500
let's try another if you're on the other

2623
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:37,270
side of that token hey there's a bunch

2624
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,350
of a [ __ ] hit yeah maybe if you're on

2625
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:39,370
the other side of that token is what

2626
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:41,770
your [ __ ] hippies driving around in

2627
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:55,000
Sprinter vans cuz tip me out that's all

2628
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:57,100
I'm saying commission as we come out of

2629
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,869
the shadows we need to remember why we

2630
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:02,110
did some of this [ __ ] we did the shadows

2631
01:38:58,869 --> 01:39:04,059
like I remember how good it felt to be

2632
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:05,859
free here and how much I wanted to walk

2633
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:09,760
about to everybody be like you know what

2634
01:39:05,859 --> 01:39:12,039
I like weed and that's all and then just

2635
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:15,579
log off that's because it was felt like

2636
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:17,469
it was there was so much [ __ ] heaped

2637
01:39:15,579 --> 01:39:19,840
onto it for so long and when we finally

2638
01:39:17,469 --> 01:39:22,210
got to the point where like as a voting

2639
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,640
population we said [ __ ] prohibition

2640
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:26,679
we're done with that [ __ ] weeds legal

2641
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,110
here like regularly go get it at a store

2642
01:39:26,679 --> 01:39:30,609
legal like that was before we went

2643
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:33,189
overboard with the rules and regs and

2644
01:39:30,609 --> 01:39:36,159
[ __ ] but like I remember how good that

2645
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:37,659
felt and I remember why we shed a lot of

2646
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:40,090
the stuff that we had during the

2647
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:42,279
Prohibition days but do now they're

2648
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,750
busting like 30 guys a week who were

2649
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:46,119
just growing a hundred plants in their

2650
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:47,948
shed and every one of these

2651
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:49,149
[ __ ] they bust them and they're

2652
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:52,928
like what were you thinking and they

2653
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:54,819
were like I thought it was legal I just

2654
01:39:52,929 --> 01:39:56,649
want to [ __ ] slap these people like

2655
01:39:54,819 --> 01:39:58,569
you're ruining it for the rest of us

2656
01:39:56,649 --> 01:40:00,189
what aren't you getting like I get that

2657
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:01,210
it's still thirty five hundred a pound

2658
01:40:00,189 --> 01:40:04,059
if you can get it all the way to New

2659
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:11,170
York but [ __ ] your profit like you're

yeah all right Mike

2662
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:18,670
or at least be circumspect about it like

2663
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:20,140
they used to be whole magazine articles

2664
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:23,350
about not getting copper your landlord

2665
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:25,420
and we got people showing up renting

2666
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:27,010
house [ __ ] kicking doors down I had a

2667
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,179
friend who used to manage a grow store

2668
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:29,619
and he told me that one of his favorite

2669
01:40:28,179 --> 01:40:30,750
things to do was when kids would come in

2670
01:40:29,619 --> 01:40:32,699
and be all high

2671
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:34,770

2672
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:36,869

2673
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:38,520

2674
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:40,979
this [ __ ] and they pay cash for it and

2675
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:44,190
he'd smile and hand him a bunch of boxes

2676
01:40:40,979 --> 01:40:45,569
that say grow light ballast carbon

2677
01:40:44,189 --> 01:40:47,519
filter and he'd smile I go there you go

2678
01:40:45,569 --> 01:40:49,139
and they'd be like can I get a box or

2679
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,890
something you'd be like nope good luck

2680
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:51,450

2681
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:52,680
just carry that [ __ ] right out to their

2682
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:54,210
car and you're like I thought you were

2683
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:56,130
bad dude I thought you're [ __ ] gonna

2684
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:57,180
go hard because it's legal and now that

2685
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:58,560
now that you're thinking about it you

2686
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:02,170
got to carry four lights into your house

2687
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,660
you don't want anyone to see that [ __ ]

2688
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:06,239
it wasn't just for the police that we

2689
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:08,349
went through all that [ __ ] like

2690
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:09,968
there were articles about hiding from

2691
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:11,440
your landlord because sometimes

2692
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:13,569
landlords get pissed and throw your ass

2693
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:15,729
out in the street and if you're growing

2694
01:41:13,569 --> 01:41:17,649
wheat illegally they can do that without

2695
01:41:15,729 --> 01:41:19,959
batting an eyelash regardless of what

2696
01:41:17,649 --> 01:41:21,250
landlord tenant laws in your state I

2697
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,600
don't like to talk too much about stuff

2698
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,520
like this but it's a reality when

2699
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:27,190
medical marijuana first became legal

2700
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:29,170
here there was a guy Kevin shaking his

2701
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:31,479
head you know who I'm talking about a

2702
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:33,010
guy named Eric Wagner who had a medical

2703
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:34,839
marijuana grow in this neighborhood and

2704
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:36,730
three guys kicked in his front door and

2705
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:40,270
murdered him for his medical marijuana

2706
01:41:36,729 --> 01:41:42,549
grow so people forget that it's worth a

2707
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:44,500
lot of ativan it was worth thirty five

2708
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:46,960
hundred dollars a pound it was $300 an

2709
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,090
ounce easily on around here and once you

2710
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,469
got it out of here it was way more it's

2711
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:51,850
four thousand on the East Coast five

2712
01:41:50,469 --> 01:41:53,829
thousand on the East Coast back then and

2713
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:58,120
they knew people east the people that

2714
01:41:53,829 --> 01:42:00,219
shot him and killed him there's uh one

2715
01:41:58,119 --> 01:42:03,309
of the sheriff's up north I want to say

2716
01:42:00,219 --> 01:42:06,939
how paso or were one of those might have

2717
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:09,160
been denver racked up like eleven

2718
01:42:06,939 --> 01:42:12,129
homicides that they could tie to exactly

2719
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:14,319
that string of events people who want

2720
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:16,239
weed but don't have money for weed find

2721
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:18,549
out you have weed shoot you and take

2722
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,109
your weed and then take it back to

2723
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:21,760
wherever they're from and sell it at the

2724
01:42:20,109 --> 01:42:25,569
ridiculous price that weed sells were

2725
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:27,100
there um there's still plenty of that in

2726
01:42:25,569 --> 01:42:29,198
Colorado because it's still commodity

2727
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:30,550
you're basically posting on Facebook hey

2728
01:42:29,198 --> 01:42:32,589
guys look at all this jewelry I just

2729
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:34,329
bought yep yeah by the way I don't have

2730
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:37,420
a safe it's just in my spare bedroom

2731
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:40,409
just because it's legal in Colorado and

2732
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:40,409
we are

2733
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:46,038
kind of soft you know what I mean we're

2734
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:48,588
we're soft not everybody around us is

2735
01:42:46,038 --> 01:42:50,868
super soft and we've gotten soft and

2736
01:42:48,588 --> 01:42:52,248
comfortable the people here's what I

2737
01:42:50,868 --> 01:42:54,108
think I'm trying to say did I have that

2738
01:42:52,248 --> 01:42:55,908
edge anymore because we're not it used

2739
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:57,769
to be it used to be a gangster business

2740
01:42:55,908 --> 01:43:00,288
it used to be a thug business the people

2741
01:42:57,769 --> 01:43:02,809
that used to grow and have cannabis and

2742
01:43:00,288 --> 01:43:04,818
produce that much of a valuable product

2743
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:06,949
had a gun had some street cred it had

2744
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:09,739
some homies knew how to throw down knew

2745
01:43:06,948 --> 01:43:13,458
what to look for heads down the street

2746
01:43:09,738 --> 01:43:15,708
it's legal and then people that had no

2747
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:17,328
business in that kind of business got in

2748
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:18,769
that business and didn't realize I've

2749
01:43:17,328 --> 01:43:22,188
kind of delved into the black market

2750
01:43:18,769 --> 01:43:24,289
like doctors lawyers were setting up

2751
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:26,539
businesses like our friend that we used

2752
01:43:24,288 --> 01:43:29,208
to have the dispensary with he had no

2753
01:43:26,538 --> 01:43:30,948
business dealing with some of my other

2754
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:32,599
people I was a middleman for people that

2755
01:43:30,948 --> 01:43:33,948
he should have never been involved with

2756
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:36,010
but he was because of me

2757
01:43:33,948 --> 01:43:38,719
well there were a lot of people that

2758
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:41,958
came in the door in those days looking

2759
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:44,328
to move product that that they never

2760
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:47,088
could have moved safely in any other

2761
01:43:44,328 --> 01:43:48,558
market I'm not again I could have robbed

2762
01:43:47,088 --> 01:43:51,469
some of those [ __ ] people I could

2763
01:43:48,559 --> 01:43:53,689
have said boo I'm sorry it had no

2764
01:43:51,469 --> 01:43:55,908
business being in that sort of market

2765
01:43:53,689 --> 01:43:57,619

2771
01:44:06,529 --> 01:44:10,939
held two quarter pound jars and they'd

2772
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:12,528
come in hugging it like it was a baby

2773

but they were trying to football carry

2774
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:18,439
it and they'd go purchase and then

2775
01:44:16,969 --> 01:44:21,198
they'd look around the waiting room to

2776
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:23,029
see if anybody heard every [ __ ] time

for an hour give or take Mike nodded his

2812
01:45:35,219 --> 01:45:39,719
head who remembers the time I tried to

2813
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:41,699
write with my dabber no I picked up this

2814
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:43,050
day for them to write with this yeah I

2815
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:45,059
was gonna say I finally matched him out

2816
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:48,180
I almost just took a DAB with my actual

2817
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:49,710
pen there was a story where they tried

2818
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:52,140
to say kid died from weed and he

2819
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:54,719
actually died from smoking plastic PEZ

2820
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:56,610
dispenser and yeah that's how that

2821
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,289
happens is people try to dab off a bit

2822
01:45:56,609 --> 01:46:00,329
past different [ __ ] that's like when

2823
01:45:58,289 --> 01:46:01,560
people get drunk and drive into people

2824
01:46:00,329 --> 01:46:02,939
and they smoke the joint before they

2825
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,590
left the bar but they also had a hundred

2826
01:46:02,939 --> 01:46:05,699
and seventy two beers and like oh they

2827
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:11,039
crashed and died because they smoked

2828
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:13,380

2829
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,840
credit card tab come on but it had to be

2830
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:17,340
the weed because alcohol is completely

2831
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,010
safe and okay you could buy it at the

2832

podcast without a loyal audience that

3088
01:56:58,989 --> 01:57:02,469
would be schizophrenia or some [ __ ] if I

3089
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,400

that I can help somebody and I'm sure

3159
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:23,250
that if you're having that problem if

3160
01:59:21,539 --> 01:59:25,769
one dude in Texas has a problem that

3161
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:27,359
means that a dude in Iowa Alabama Kansas

3162
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:28,950
and Louisiana probably have a similar

3163
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:30,000
problem and they just haven't bothered

3164
01:59:28,949 --> 01:59:31,649
to email me yet

3165
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,659
or they were going to that's why I like

3166
01:59:31,649 --> 01:59:35,250
the email show so much it lets me know

3167
01:59:33,659 --> 01:59:37,109
that I'm hitting a target instead of

3168
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:38,760
just blabbering maybe this is a good

3169
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:40,679
idea like it lets me know I'm actually

3170
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:42,930
getting my idea out to at least one

3171
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:44,940
person and like I said if one person has

3172
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:46,200
