215
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,639
a [ __ ] edible whoa holy [ __ ] yes and

216
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,009
most of that was the would you say 120

217
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,930
milligrams of THC yeah yeah so I haven't

218
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,389
eaten edibles you guys in over a year

219
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,668
you took a long I took a long edible

220
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:43,470
break a really really long edible break

221
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:48,899
and definitely since well before March I

222
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:50,539
was gifted some edibles and I decided

223
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,310
since I was sick and had a sore throat

224
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:55,889
there's time to much them so I got down

225
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,660
on a half godoh bar 860 milligrams of it

226
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,228
I was like I kind of feel like I might

227
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,509
be huh

228
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:03,089
so 860 more and I was like now I'm

229
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,500
[ __ ] high 120 milligrams had my highs

230
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,819
a little red and I was feeling a little

231
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,279
loopy and then they took a couple of

232
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,288
small dabs just to [ __ ] push me right

233
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,000
there and it got me I was pretty lit so

234
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:14,579
I'm kind of back on the edibles train

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,860
you guys I'm not gonna go crazy I don't

236
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,168
want to be the super edible monster that

237
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,300
I was for a while you guys it would not

238
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,439
be a feat for me to eat a thousand

239
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,240
milligrams in one sitting

240
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:30,180
oh that used to happen regularly once a

241
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,348
week once every two weeks I was hanging

242
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,028
out with some guys that like to do the

243
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:35,429
thousand and the 2500 milligram

244
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:37,320
challenge yeah once it started as a

245
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,629
thousand and within like a month it was

246
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,659
to 2500 well yeah cuz a thousand got

247
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:45,120
easy like you do wouldn't I've gotten

248
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,649
really crazy metabolism I could eat 120

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,990
milligrams and not be high in two hours

250
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,389
so a 250 and then I'm not high in two

251
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,120
and a half hours and then I eat 300 and

252
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:57,240
then I'm just super high for an hour but

253
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,580
it just didn't like it just all comes

254
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,959
through at once but once you start

255
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,339
getting in like the thousands II that's

256
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,129
when you start getting up like for our

257
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,750
high want to eat that 2500 milligram you

258
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,850
get these visions why I can do that to

259
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:13,679
myself with like 30 not the Vision Quest

260
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,089
but the bait for 3 hours sorry that the

261
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,838
iPad rang that might have interrupted

262
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,190
the recording I'm not sure no the iPad

263
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,510
rang though that's really weird I turned

264
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,700
off all the phones in the [ __ ] high

265
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:30,059
path sorry about that that's very

266
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,550
unprofessional it did a really good job

267
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,588
for the last hour it just dropped the

268
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,479
ball now we've got a it doesn't have the

269
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,010
little floppy thing like the phone does

270
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,720
on the side to put it all the way down

271
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:43,950
so I can't turn it down that's cool

272

376
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,780
email bin I'm kind of curious what

377
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,710
you're gonna rambling but I can read

378
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:44,759
emails anything just pick one and like

379
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:47,160
like as if it's the second email one

380
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,819
thing okay so today I saw this on five

381
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,350
different anti-pop pages that I follow

382
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,710
there was another recall today in

383
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,909
Colorado where some dispensary used some

384
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,440
pesticide that isn't allowed in

385
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:03,600
commercial use for cannabis in Colorado

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,540
when they sent their [ __ ] to be lab

387
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,370
tested it tested for that it got

388
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,250
recalled because of that the way it

389
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,830
works in Colorado is you can't send any

390
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,879
of the harvest batch out before the lab

391
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,579
test comes back

392
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,220
so all of that product was still sitting

393
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:23,519
on a shelf waiting to be sent to a

394
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,949
retail location like the announcement

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,620
was the system working was legalization

396
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:31,379
working was a huge point of legalization

397
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,639
being passed into law millions of people

398
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,610
are already spending billions of dollars

399
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,589
on marijuana the least we can do is make

400
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,690
sure they're buying a lab tested product

401
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,639
didn't know what they're getting in this

402
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,589
is the system working and I see five

403
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,240
different anti-pop pages like oh my god

404
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:48,089
it's not natural or safe this is a

405
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,430
marijuana fail and then on the way over

406
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:52,680
here I see that I can I want to say

407
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,958
Safeway had their burritos recalled for

408
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,929
Listeria and so when I get home tonight

409
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,729
and I'm gonna be like burrito fail not

410
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,708
Safeway is a dangerous corporation yep

411
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,240
no I'm just kidding don't employ that

412
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,679
wasn't one of the five things that

413
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,879
flashed through my head when you're like

414
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,469
what do you want to rant about ya know

415
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,519
it's a good thing Mike instead cannabis

416
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,449
got caught no I am pretty sure that only

417
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,828
recreational cannabis is tested for

418
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:17,189
pesticide is that accurate

419
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:19,500
at this point it's do you know the

420
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,540
requirements are for both but the

421
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,289
medical doesn't have to be submitted

422
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:27,328
until January one I believe okay we

423
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,860
don't have enough [ __ ] labs yeah

424
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:31,198
that's that's a whole other story there

425
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,909
if you don't know the the places that

426
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,399
test the cantaloupe and the chicken

427
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:38,509
wings aren't allowed to test the

428
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:42,120
cannabis because of federal licensure

429
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:44,129
the first lab in Colorado that got set

430
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,759
up to test cannabis applied for that

431
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:50,100
license and got raided

432
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,980
so the it's walkie we're still building

433
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,050
part of that system but all rec is

434
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,490
tested for pesticides yeah all

435
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,750
recreational cannabis so if you're

436
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,740
buying if you're coming from another

437
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,568
state and or shopping at the

438
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,579
recreational market your product has

439
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:05,219
been tested which is weird I think they

440
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:09,239
would have done medical first um they

441
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,399
wanted to but medical was already up and

442
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,139
running and had kind of built a stable

443
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,899
system before they passed any of these

444
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:21,028
rules and then they were lobbied heavily

445
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,058
by both the testing labs and the REC

446
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:25,588
owners the REC owners have a hard enough

447
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:26,850
time getting their lab tests turned

448
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,740
around and a reasonable amount of time

449
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,840
and they end up with

450
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,360
like sitting in a storeroom when they

451
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,670
want it sitting on a store shelf and so

452
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,070
they lobbied pretty heavily to not

453
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:41,490
require medical submissions or turn

454
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,230
around there were enough labs part of

455
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,549
that's because in the years since this

456
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,070
was done it's been like two and a half

457
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:49,289
years we've several more labs have

458
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,970
opened up for a while look in one lab in

459
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,769
Jurong go they could do one of the tests

460
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,060
yeah and we do [ __ ] send our [ __ ] -

461
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,590
[ __ ] Boulder

462
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,289
yeah we're in Pueblo and we have a

463
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,090
courier do it comes from Boulder and

464
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:02,009
then drives down all the way down to

465
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,720
Pueblo turns around five minutes after

466
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,400
he gets there and drives all the way

467
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,400
back to Boulder it's like the shittiest

468
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,320
drug deal you could ever imagine

469
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,269

half hours home yeah it's yeah the fun

472

Mountain Dew you drink the Mountain Dew

496

497
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,770
function at all okay I don't know you

498
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,740
see how insane I am up front these days

499
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:13,500
and you add a two-year-old to that like

500
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,680
it's a miracle I'm [ __ ] talking

501
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,000
English right now and not just gibberish

502
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,070
um what do you guys want to hear about

503
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,089
you want to hear about Maine's governor

504
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:25,859
vetoing legalization that passed by

505
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:29,099
[ __ ] popular vote

506
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:32,909
so in election and he just said nah it

507
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:34,980
passed the state legislature and Senate

508
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,410
had to pass rules and regulations

509
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,980
package isn't the governor said no today

510
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:45,130
in his statement about it he's he said

511
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,169
suffice other states that have done this

512
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,990
did so under an Obama administration

513
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:52,330
that was pretty clear that they were

514
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,179
gonna be hands-off we don't have that

515
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:57,039
anymore so I ain't gonna risk it which

516
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,990
is nonsense because if you remember

517
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,079
folks this was the governor who went on

518
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,900
national television elected politician

519
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,859
in front of a camera that he invited and

520
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,840
he says and this is a quote or as close

521
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,759
as I can get to a quote so I apologize

522
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,730
for the heavy racial / - undertones and

523
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,220
overtones but this governor of Maine

524
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,470
says we don't want to pass a law and

525
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,579
encourage d-money to come up here and

526
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,919
impregnate white girls with luring them

527
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:28,750
with drugs that's what his fear of

528
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,370
marijuana was at legalization and he

529
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,440
threw out a couple of names like D money

530
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,759
and I can't remember the other two D

531
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,789
money is the one that's stuck in my head

532
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,200
lightly racist not even slightly it's

533
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,639
it's ridiculous

534
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,710
like I don't know how he's still got his

535
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,290
job after going on TV and saying that

536

percent with my head cold here it's a

612
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,509
lot easier to ramble with two people got

613
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,890
to give the people's with the walk that

614
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,180
hissing sound is Mike filling up the

615
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,759
torch I should have probably turned down

616
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:01,630
his mic I apologize that's the tame the

617
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,039
tame brain all right so uh let's get

618
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,490
into an email we've been rambling a

619
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,490
whole bunch

620
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,220
all right so this one comes from

621
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,440
somebody who did not mention if they

622
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,140
want their name set on the show what up

623
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,830
Chris

624
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,210
such a great [ __ ] callback oh my god

625
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:25,629
that person probably doesn't listen they

626
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,690
probably hate us deleted all podcasts

627
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,820
off their phone and in spite all right

628
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,559
anyway our friar listeners sent an email

629
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,210
and said Rasta Jeff I know you're a busy

630
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,980
man but could you point me in the

631
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,200
direction of some short growing strains

632
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,120
that the dank team provides I've been

633
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,680
viewing strains on their website but

634
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,289
they don't show height stats on any of

635
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,610
the strings there you go all that sound

636
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,129
you guys heard was Mike not being able

637
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:49,899
to turn off the tour charge [ __ ] with

638
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,490
me the dog was just trolling me it did

639
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:56,680
it to me earlier it would not shut off

640
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:58,059
it's becoming dangerous anyway the

641
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,680
strains on their website but they don't

642
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,539
show any height stats on any of the

643
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,279
strains also a lot of the strains are

644
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:05,349
hard to find on other websites so I

645
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,579
can't cross-reference many of them to

646
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:11,139
find this out well I tried to get

647
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,839
through it without choking those dabs we

648
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,700
took have me choking let's see this

649
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,939
listener wants me to give them

650
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,120
information on short growing strains

651
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,519
available at the dev team so I did a

652
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,089
little bit of research they do have some

653
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:30,009
IRA genetics available

654
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:31,179
short growing now I'm not sure Mike's a

655
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:33,519
dying over there should I leave the mic

656
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,049
on or not we'll turn it down so that you

657
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,079
can hear him while you turn purple then

658
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:39,960
pale a little bit of sweat I think Mike

659
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,159
is kind of like my lease I add you guys

660
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,690
it's fun watching him change colors

661
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,200
might give me a thumbs up when you're

662
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,539
alive and we'll put your mic back on I'm

663
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,370
alive don't turn it on alright now I'm

664
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:54,789
not sure if you mean short growing

665
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:58,209
strains by like height wise or timelines

666
00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:00,009
I'm not certain what you mean by short

667
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,759
growing strains when I read the question

668
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:06,369
the first time I interpreted it

669
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:08,019
interpreted the question has height now

670
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:12,159
that I'm rereading it on the show I'm

671
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:13,690
wondering if you meant time yeah do you

672
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,610
mean like some eight week plant some

673
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,180
seven week plants and night maybe yeah

674
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:22,119
or do you mean not as tall because I may

675
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,370
need to redo my research but

676
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,509
let's talk about I'm coming back folks

677
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,439
yeah I'm putting your mic back on I just

678
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:27,369
reached over to do that there you go

679
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,679
mics back you guys

680
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,969
hanging it back in hmm it makes my mic

681
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,169
sound better to it get a little echo off

682
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,390
that one he's lying he's not back in

683
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,190
he's lying back ish all right so uh

684
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,169
here's something that fits both

685
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,730
categories cookie stopper cookie stopper

686
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:45,549
some of the cookies stopper phenotypes

687
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,159
are done in like eight ish weeks 56 days

688
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:49,629
maybe 60 days and also they don't get

689
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,460
too tall ah

690
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,760
so cookie stopper fits both of those

691
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,028
categories another one prana prana is a

692
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,730
cross a flow and arise prana makes very

693
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:02,710
unique smelling plants they smell

694
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,990
amazing and some of them are done at

695
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,480
like 55 some are done at 60 some are

696
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,210
done at 63 days and they won't get too

697
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,308
tall Mike you all right bro I'm dead

698
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,649
tabs taking me places I can see it -

699
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:16,599
you're you weren't there for a moment no

700
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:24,819
I went somewhere else it was fun you

701
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:26,949
guys I wish I said cookie stopper I said

702
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:28,450
prana that I say the flow stopper no

703
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,038
stopper would be good for it doesn't

704
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,200
take too long to flower and stay sharp

705
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,408
another one that you will love that

706
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,390
everybody will love ah the morning dew

707
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:39,429
morning dew is grateful dog which is one

708
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,620
of my prizes one of my favorites cross

709
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,730
to arise which is another one of a lot

710
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,469
of people's favorites those are two of

711
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,990
my favorite strains I cry bread both of

712
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,169
them I crossed them together I call it

713
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,970
morning dew it doesn't get too tall if

714
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,259
there are some very cushion dominant

715
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,990
phenotypes in there that will give you

716
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:57,908
some big fat beefy cush it's got there's

717
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,798
some Kim D in there there's Joseph's og

718
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:02,289
there's a lot of great stuff in that

719
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:04,269
cross there's San Fernando Valley og

720
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,259
cush there's chem 91 there's a lot of

721
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:09,788
things in there that'll give you some

722
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:12,269
vigor you'll get some short but buddy

723
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:14,950
plants if you find the right phenotypes

724
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:16,569
so that's stuff for my region etics

725
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,830
let's talk about stuff from other

726
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:22,480
breeders Mike it looked like you had an

727
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:24,699
idea just if this is if you're talking

728
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,500
height or timeline if you're talking

729
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,269
high and you're really restricted shoot

730
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,970
us an email with some specifications of

731
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:32,379
your grow area and I know Jeff can come

732
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,360
up with three or four ideas to help you

733
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,920
out guaranteed on that guaranteed

734
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,779
but what things are still fluttering I

735
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,759
can I can see it yeah we can hear it a

736
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,319
little bit in you I'm sorry touch oh

737
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,058
you're good man we go you took a big old

738
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,369
dab you took click for from your size

739
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:49,190
dad yeah which is a one dad for a normal

740
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:51,048
girl but another string that I could

741
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,000
recommend it's no dab competition I'm

742
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:54,470
just [ __ ] with you another strain I

743
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,269
could recommend that is not from Ira

744
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,610
genetics but it is available at the dank

745
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:01,129
team comm is from our friends at La

746
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:03,709
Plata labs I would recommend the Durango

747
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,600
og that finishes it's got phenotypes

748
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,679
that finish in eight weeks you guys when

749
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,659
you're growing from seed you're gonna

750
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,769
find some phenotypes that finish earlier

751
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,080
some that finish later

752
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,639
find grow from seed if that scope I'll

753
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,629
get that earlier finishing one that

754
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,910
works best for you

755
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,470
finish it up that way [ __ ] you've got

756
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,048
what you need so the Durango OG will

757
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,100
have eight week phenotypes in there

758
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,960
here's another strain that I don't hype

759
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,829
a lot because it gets enough [ __ ]

760
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,100
hype on its own

761
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:31,279
tangey tangi from Crockett family farms

762
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:32,480
if you grow it up to be about I don't

763
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,339
know how high your tight restrictions

764
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,410
are but it's not it's not one of those

765
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,480
strains that stretch plants do what we

766
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,190
like to call the 21-day stretch for the

767
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,720
first three weeks of flower they really

768
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,490
like to take the [ __ ] off just the sky

769
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,220
they like to just start taking off tangi

770
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,910
doesn't seem to do it as badly as a lot

771
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,400
of other plants

772
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,830
Tangie kind of doesn't stretch for those

773
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,980
yeah tangi stays sort of low for you so

774
00:28:54,829 --> 00:29:01,819
Stan G crosses strawberry-banana tangi

775
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,470
the taffy stuff like that was just Angie

776
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,269
and happy stuff like that'll stay kind

777
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,829
of shorter for you and they also the

778
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:08,389
tangent crosses don't take a real long

779
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:11,000
time to finish so that fits both of your

780
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,590
timelines that should be enough

781
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,849
recommendations for you Mike I'll put

782
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,798
your mic back on you look like you're

783
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:17,899
back on the planet I'm mostly good to go

784
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,750
you're on Animal Planet again bigs like

785
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:23,210
a cake but good to go baked like a cake

786
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,890
so those are some strains that are

787
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,480
available there's a lot of stuff

788
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,740
available from the Cali connection

789
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,019
you'll find some eight or nine week

790
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,609
phenotypes that stays fairly short

791
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,139
because they're cush dominant I'm not

792
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,359
exactly sure what you meant so let me

793
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,390
know if you want fast flowering or low

794
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,279
height because short growing has me

795
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,570
confused I did at first I thought one

796
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,839
thing and I read it again and I thought

797
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:47,599
another thing so let me know what you

798
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,009
think randomly I want to give a huge

799
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,579
shout out to my friends the

800
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:54,619
swings that's right plays I just saw one

801
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:57,019
fly by I really slay swings in a garden

802
00:29:54,619 --> 00:30:03,469
recently and I just saw a swing fly by

803
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:05,269
here because uh yeah let's see hey to

804
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,819
our friend that sent this email we're

805
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:10,220
gonna call you height restrictions

806
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:12,230

can guide you more carefully I gave you

808
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,370
a few strange recommendations I would

809
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,680
like to get more specific and answer

810
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:22,219
your question more specifically Mike you

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,470
got any insight on that one no just let

812
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,500
us know which one you meant and we can

813
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,029
get you a better list of quick flowering

814
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,279
strains or a better list of short

815
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,039
strains or we can give you some specific

816
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,869
road tips to work with your space

817
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,299
absolutely uh you can trellis down most

818
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:40,639
plants put a little four by four or a

819
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:42,529
five by five trellis and add up like

820
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,830
just the square net I've seen so many

821
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:47,180
different methods yeah yeah but they

822
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:48,769
just let the plant grow into that and

823
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,019
then when it starts it'll grow up into

824
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:53,000
it and then just bend it down and keep

825
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:54,829
it weave it into that basically is what

826
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,480
you're doing to keep it low don't let it

827
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:59,569
go up let it go out and spread it out

828
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,279
one plant 5x5 I watched a guy every

829
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:03,379
morning he went out and he dipped the

830
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,259
top of his plant into the next loop of

831
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,960
chain link to the left yep in come

832
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:11,089
October it was just one long vine that

833
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,640
went halfway down his fence with little

834
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:15,949
Christmas tree buds coming off a big

835
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,540
pine cone or up yeah large pine cones

836
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,400
sticking off of each little spot yep so

837
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:20,899
instead of one giant glory bud sticking

838
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,360
up and touching the light you get a

839
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,130
whole room a whole 5x5 section I'm just

840
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,649
beautiful little buds little seven

841
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,390
grammars everywhere yep yep nice setup

842
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,250
all right so scrog it out keep him well

843
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,210
let us know how we can guide you a

844
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:36,710
little bit further oh let's see since

845
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,660
we're talking about seeds here's another

846
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,670
question about seeds he says hey Jeff

847
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,529
I've emailed before from Alaska about an

848
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,360
auto flower and you hooked me up with

849
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,859
the answer now I'm hoping for a two for

850
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,089
two it's been a little while since you

851
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,439
sent this I'm sorry I've got a ton of

852
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:50,779
[ __ ] emails but here you are I hope

853
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,250
you're still listening big shout out he

854
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:54,049
continues to say I'm interested in your

855
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:57,200
seeds and would like to know what strain

856
00:31:54,049 --> 00:32:01,000
is a good producer and good flavor

857
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,840
I grow hi Oh to output deepwater hydro I

858
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,460
think I embarrassed myself

859
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,220
with my last episode about deep water

860
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,509
culture and hydroponics so I'll go ahead

861
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,920
and admit that I don't have a lot of

862
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:12,289
experience with that type of grow

863
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,360
situation but I do have a lot of

864
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:18,379
experience with strains that are good

865
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:21,109
producers and good flavor um good

866
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,250
producers anything crossed to the white

867
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:27,799
widow so Widow get Snuggie the look on

868
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,289
your face Widow kids noogie there's Mike

869
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:31,819
still - beautiful there's a white water

870
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:33,920
plant that my father-in-law of all

871
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,809
people grew that when people say white

872
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,330
widow I'm immediately flashed back to

873
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,569
that summer harvesting her like it was

874
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:42,649
just monumental the Storm Shadow cross

875
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:45,259
is what I'm talking about

876
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,150
from Ira genetics eye region etics puts

877
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:50,450
out huge are the Storm Shadow puts out

878
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:53,450
huge colas tastes really really amazing

879
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:56,059
kind of unique that's a good one so I

880
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:59,000
would go for the Storm Shadow that's

881
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:01,099
white widow to arise also there's the

882
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,519
cream the cream doesn't harvest as well

883
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:09,379
but the flavor is amazing I'm curious

884
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,970
what the look on your face means I just

885
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,010
I'm sitting there trying to think of

886
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,660
strains and my list is very different

887
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:16,339
than yours because it's generated from

888
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,650
different places and a totally different

889
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:21,529
knowledge base but um and then I

890
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,330
chuckled because of our friend 44 in

891
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,029
blue dream that's sort of what people

892
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:28,039
love about it is it's got a smell and a

893
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,480
favorite profile that most people find

894
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,930
pleasant and it harvest like a

895
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,960
[ __ ] another strain of mine

896
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,279
that's available at the dank team if

897
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,350
it's not available the dank team

898
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,619
available that I stutter on available

899
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:46,069
another strain you can get it at the

900
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:48,559
what's it called dank seedot CO or just

901
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:49,789
Google the hell a dank seed company and

902
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,250
you'll be able to find it but something

903
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:55,399
I recommend is called scarlet begonias

904
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,740
it's redheaded stranger to arise and it

905
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,390
will produce huge crops and it will

906
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,160
smell amazing so there's a few

907
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,290
recommendations for you I hope you find

908
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,630
something you like in that makes there

909
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,470

926
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:38,969
because you wrote this email to me in

927
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,898
May and I'm just now reading it to you I

928
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:45,178
apologize when my phone updated it wiped

929
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,279
out all my emails off my phone and I had

930
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,500
to go download apps for each individual

931
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,780
email address so if I've got yeah well

932
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,789
no then when I reloaded it on the app it

933
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,800
brought up so many [ __ ] emails I was

934
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:59,599
like I never even saw that so I printed

935
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,590
them off but I wasted like seven trees

936
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,000
I've got the emails and I'm reading them

937
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,070
now so this one came from May and I'm

938
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,260
reading it I apologize but hey I read it

939
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,900
I did it I'm gonna catch up there's so

940
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,590
many emails all right Mike you got

941
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,269
anything you want to add to the high

942
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,390
good producer and good flavor from I

943
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:19,650
read genetics seeds nope yeah I didn't

944
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:21,690
think you'd have any better insight than

945
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,329
what I've got available know that read

946
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,670
IRA genetics each part yeah they want

947
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:30,809
something from my line that's funny so I

948
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:32,400
would say the Storm Shadow and the yeah

949
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,079
those are the way to go some older stuff

950
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,639
that will be a lot harder to find than

951
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,679
those that that meets that definition

952
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,509
but the Capleton if you can get the

953
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,669
Storm Shadow [ __ ] dive on Bounty

954
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,810
Killer the battery kill is what I was

955
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,369
thinking I was specific I don't know

956
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,369
where that's available Bounty Killer

957
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:49,650
seats go get those it was laser your

958
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:51,509
standard movie theater straw with a

959
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,800
two-liter bottle on it is how that plant

960
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,550
built out there was just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

961
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,300
yeah

962
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,560
just insane nugget everywhere alright

963
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,260
let's see I've got another email I want

964
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,409
to read do it I'll ramble a lot through

965
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,330
it so I wish you luck it looks long it

966
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:07,980
is kind of long but it's quickened to

967
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:10,019
the point for being so long this guy

968

979
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,130
been listening for a few months just

980
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,809
keeping up with the most current one

981
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,180
posted recently your podcast has

982
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:41,279
recently started to click with me one of

983
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,199
your latest GF wih podcasts you had set

984
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,630
out a correctly used weed terminology

985
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,730
like the phrase dabs instead of dab when

986
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,440
you talk about doing dabs I thought you

987
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,389
brought up a good point and it really

988
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,909
seemed like a move I would do too I

989
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:56,279
would do also in trying to help out my

990
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:58,799
weed smoking brothers now I feel more

991
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,269
like your brother to me than most and I

992
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,670
gotta say it's all because of this

993
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:04,500
badass podcast so keep up the good work

994
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,780
brother and let's work together to

995
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,269
educate each other about what we are

996
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,370
truly passionate about there's more the

997
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,750
email but I want to say I like these

998
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,880
emails when people tell me that they

999
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,739
feel like they're my friend because this

1000
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,599
may sound weird but I'm not only a

1001
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,959
podcaster but I listen to podcasts as

1002
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,389
well

1003
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,940
right I'm also a member but I listen to

1004
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:25,589
a lot of podcasts and I listened to the

1005
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,539
podcast hosted by comedians I don't

1006
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,120
listen to a lot of cannabis podcast you

1007
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,250
guys the reason I don't listen to a lot

1008
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,989
of cannabis podcasts is because I don't

1009
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,489
want to bite their style I don't want to

1010
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:37,799
accidentally steal their voice I don't

1011
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,579
want to contaminate my flow with yes

1012
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,590
exactly

1013
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:44,369
I don't want to become other people so I

1014
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:49,380
try to keep my god shot at for friends

1038
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:39,659
month like with a little bit of overtime

1039

and maybe a small bonus just pay me what

1040
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,529
I expect to make in a month which I know

1041
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,970
what I bring in

1042
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,230
the podcast listeners could put that

1043
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,909
together I'm not asking you guys to this

1044
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,010
hypothetical this would be the drug I

1045
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:51,679
would put out and you'd go full Rogan I

1046
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,930
would put out four episodes a week of

1047
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,639
new content and then every Thursday I

1048
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:58,099
would still do a throwback Thursday I do

1049
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,799
Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and

1050
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:02,119
then I put out a throwback Thursday

1051
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,289
podcasts on her Friday seems weird I

1052
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,849
don't think anybody would even [ __ ]

1053
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,050
listen to a Friday podcast if you put

1054
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:07,309
out a show on a Friday everyone's out

1055
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,210
party and everyone's out doing their

1056
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:12,469
thing nobody's listening to a podcast

1057
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,900
road-tripping road-tripping okay maybe

1058
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:16,009
maybe and then maybe a Sunday show you

1059
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,510
know what I mean but I'd put out at

1060
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,890
least four fresh episodes and a

1061
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,020
throwback Thursday episode and I would

1062
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,029
also do a lot of YouTube stuff I would

1063
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:24,949
totally step up my social media game my

1064
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,620
life game because that would be able to

1065
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:30,049
you know what I mean I would patreon the

1066
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:33,019
[ __ ] they multiply my content time to

1067
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:34,340
plug patreon well I guess we'll do it

1068
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:37,159
patreon since we're in the middle of an

1069

1073
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,469

1074
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,059
for too long no I said this one smelled

1075
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:48,230
like one that hadn't been spitting yeah

1076
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,670

1121
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:19,969
this show is that it feels like you're

1122
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,309
when you're listening to it it feels

1123
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:24,230
like I'm at the table yeah and I don't

1124
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:27,739
know if that's because I'm often at the

1125
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:29,210
table or if that's just the field that

1126
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:31,549
everybody gets from the show or a lot of

1127

00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:38,659
they get weird and they talk differently

1159
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:41,239

1169
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:56,118
let's go right you probably spent a

1170
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,150
couple hundred hours with that voice

1171
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,130
next to you yeah yeah I know so when he

1172
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,900
starts talking I know what he's talking

1173
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,099
about like I relate to it and so when

1174
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,690
these people what I'm getting to is when

1175
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:08,839
people say that I'm more like a brother

1176
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:10,210
I reciprocate that feeling I understand

1177
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,369
that probably more than something

1178
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,720
would I here's a really random story

1179
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:15,460
that's gonna make me feel like a fanboy

1180
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,838
I've been watching Chris Hardwick's and

1181
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,789
singled out Harvick's an awesome

1182
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,469
comedian funny dude I've heard him say

1183
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:22,570
several times I want to play Red Rocks

1184
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:24,789
Chris Hardwick is from Denver his one of

1185
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:27,430
his wife goals bucket list is to play at

1186
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:30,820
Red Rocks in Morrison Colorado he was on

1187
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:33,069
the oddball comedy tour that one year

1188
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,530
that played at [ __ ] Red Rocks he

1189
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:37,269
walked out on stage and took a selfie of

1190
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,930
himself and he goes I've always wanted

1191
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:41,829
to [ __ ] do that I felt an odd sense

1192
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:43,899
of pride

1193
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:46,480
we were watching a friend me the Gleek

1194
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,519
like you did it I was like I've got to

1195
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,170
play Red Rocks man that's [ __ ] cool

1196
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,389
and honestly horlicks one of the few

1197
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,920
I've never met I've seen him I've seen

1198
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:55,659
him do shows but I've never shook his

1199
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,460
hand I've never he doesn't seem like the

1200
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:58,960
type to hang out after a comedy works

1201
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,869
and smoke a joint whether downstream

1202
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,670
right right he's yeah he's different he

1203
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:06,760
seems like he'd need to be out a plan to

1204
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,250
go film a talking show right exactly

1205
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,960

yep yeah but but anyway I relate to it

1209
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:17,500
because when I saw Hardwick up there at

1210
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,358

sofa okay so I got a fan reached out

1305
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,250
through Pueblo for sensible cannabis

1306
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:58,679
laws Facebook page and asked me about

1307
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:02,730
Texas medical marijuana law and some

1308
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:05,699
tips about advancing the legalization

1309
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,769
cause down in Tejas so I for the first

1310
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:10,078
time ever looked up Texas is medical

1311
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:12,960
marijuana law I hadn't even heard about

1312
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:16,170
it I've been so busy that got passed me

1313
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,230
in there law is like ten milligrams of

1314
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:24,630
CBD less than half a milligram of THC

1315
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:26,068
oil only like super bullshitty and they

1316
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,630
were asking me what I thought they

1317
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:30,659
should do to advance the cause and I

1318
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,950
gave them the you can dig back through

1319
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,449
the pile and find a whole forty five

1320
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:34,769
minutes show on like going to City

1321
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:37,710
Council and getting involved in local

1322
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:40,108
politics and researching and going and

1323
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,608
making a solid argument that we did for

1324
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:42,960
a podcast and I kind of gave him that

1325
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:45,420
spiel and I thought about it for a

1326
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,269
minute I was like no [ __ ] leave like

1327
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,970
you you you know a trade you work in a

1328
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:53,338
trade save up some money and the more I

1329
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,808
thought about it I'm like if I was in

1330
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:58,230
that situation I would save up as much

1331
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:59,670
as I could not bail like if it's

1332
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,559
possible for you to leave a place that

1333
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,170
sucks and join a place that doesn't suck

1334
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,490
why not do it like and I'm thinking

1335
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,409
about Maine right now too

1336
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:10,500
and there are a lot of people that work

1337
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:13,469
really hard if the easily the biggest

1338
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:17,420
[ __ ] in that Square area just [ __ ] it

1339
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:20,578
up for everybody and now your choice is

1340
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:24,380
fight for another two to four years and

1341
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:27,660
get back to where you were yesterday or

1342
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:32,250
work for six months live on a tight

1343
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:35,788
budget move out of hell and I can't say

1344
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,900
I don't recommend option B if you live

1345
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:41,539
in a place that's sort of in between

1346
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:44,910
hell and heaven or hell in Colorado

1347
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:47,369
feel free to fight a lot harder or maybe

1348
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:51,029
think a lot harder about fighting then

1349
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:53,160
moving but if you're in a place where

1350
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,690
they're still doing roadside cavity

1351
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:59,519
searches for I smell weed in the car

1352
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:01,230
ladies like I wouldn't feel bad about

1353
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,449
putting the rest of my [ __ ] in the truck

1354
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,789
and in heading out with just me and my

1355
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:07,889
bank account if you're going to do so

1356
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:12,559
have a plan though definitely come up

1357
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:14,639
with a plan like don't just run away but

1358
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,469
it's not that hard to move across

1359
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,539
country and start over especially if you

1360
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:22,409
make a plan save up some money it like

1361
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:24,659
more than a few months rent and look for

1362
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:26,879

00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,619

1366

because you're moving to a weed state

1394

safe clean medicine by going to a

it

1402
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,289

00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:06,078
extra details to polish my technique

1443
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:07,250
from your library of listening here's

1444
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,950
something really funny

1445
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,630
at least I thought so I recall Scotty

1446
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:13,939
and the dude catching flack for too many

1447
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:16,640
f-bombs and they mentioned that you keep

1448
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,349
it clean the first episode I listen to

1449
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,778
you read a comment about your [ __ ]

1450
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:23,180
cool show or something with lots of

1451
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:30,949
f-bombs and the next episode had a butt

1452
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:32,949
hole song listen to the episode I'm not

1453
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:34,909
sure which one was the butthole song but

1454
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:36,078
then he said that's really [ __ ]

1455
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:38,210
hilarious not at all what I was

1456
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,369
expecting to hear and I love you for it

1457
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,650
earned yourself a new disciple my friend

1458
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:45,619
anyway no secrecy about my name needed

1459
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,099
not searching for cred but not hiding

1460
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:48,769
either

1461
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:52,640
keep on teaching from collard greens

1462
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,659

1463
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:55,098
- man love you man

1464
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:56,778
thanks for uh thanks for all the love

1465
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,970
thanks for reaching out I think it's

1466
00:53:56,778 --> 00:54:01,519
funny for a little while um

1467
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:03,709
when I first started podcasting I had a

1468
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,358
dirty mouth I I was on another podcast

1469
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,650
it was comedy based I was hanging out

1470
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:07,880
with a group of folks that thought they

1471
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,440
were comedians some of them were

1472
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,269
comedians some of them will and will not

1473
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,110
be comedians and some of them just

1474
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,699
watched the movie

1475
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,260
private parts so many times some of them

1476
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:16,519
go hold a microphone for minutes and

1477
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,620
embarrass everybody but some of them are

1478
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,269
actually [ __ ] good you guys um I'm

1479
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:23,269
just kind of being a smartass about it

1480
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:25,039
but when I would leave that show like or

1481
00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:27,500
over when I would leave that show I

1482
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:30,199
would come do this show with a bad

1483
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,900
comedian attitude and I would just it

1484
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,399
doesn't stop when you hit your you you

1485
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,050
act how you're fed you know what I mean

1486
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,030
so that comedy would continue throughout

1487
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,920
my day and I would just come be a witty

1488
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:42,560
[ __ ] and it didn't work on the show

1489
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,030
but I would do it anyway and so there

1490
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,789
came a point where I was like man I cuss

1491
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,650
too much I'm gonna stop cussing and then

1492
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:50,029
I want it I put up a swear jar to where

1493
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,680
every time I said [ __ ] I had to put

1494
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:54,170
money in the jar and we donated that to

1495
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,539
a charity but then I was like you know

1496
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:59,599
what that feels weird I say [ __ ] like I

1497
00:54:56,539 --> 00:55:02,360
I have a help to tone it down but it was

1498
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,829
it got unnecessary after a point and I

1499
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,480
would feel weird cuz I'd come over here

1500
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:10,279
and you'd be doing a really good job not

1501
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:12,650
swearing yeah so we'll eventually I

1502
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,050
decided [ __ ] it I say [ __ ] I'm an adult

1503
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:16,849
this is my podcast we can put the

1504
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,590
explicit rating up on iTunes and all the

1505
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:21,489
[ __ ] adults can listen nope

1506
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:24,410
that's how it'll [ __ ] be so um yeah

1507
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:26,149
eventually I did just drop the facade

1508
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:29,420
and I like to be myself on my podcast

1509
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:31,340
now it's a lot more fun honestly someone

1510
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,349
run episode 100 I just got really

1511
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,210
comfortable here with the microphone I'm

1512
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:37,429
lucky enough to have been a guest on a

1513
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,530
few podcast shout-out to my friend Tim

1514
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:41,329
Martin and the John Doe radio podcast I

1515
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:43,519
was lucky enough to be a guest on that I

1516
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:48,259
was a guest on a couple of other shows

1517
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:50,719
and then also I got to be a co-host and

1518
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:53,330
producer of a whole nother podcast that

1519
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,489
did we did close to a hundred episodes

1520
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:56,840
before I parted ways with them they

1521
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:58,189
wanted to do a whole nother thing and

1522
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,590
the dude actually moved away from town

1523
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:02,690
so I just ended that relationship with

1524
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:04,130
that podcast but I got a very good warm

1525
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,440
up started there so I was basically

1526
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,760
comfortable when I got on this show the

1527
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,500
hard part of this show is finding the

1528
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,850
show's voice and the rhythm and what I

1529
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,889
wanted to do with it I used to have

1530
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,539
segments and weird [ __ ] but I think it's

1531
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:16,309
better when we just started talking hang

1532
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,360
out having the show when I was when you

1533
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:19,639
first started doing the throwback

1534
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,370
Thursday episodes I had completely

1535
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,779
forgotten the segments and then the

1536
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:25,339
first episode where you skipped a

1537
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,650
segment I was like oh where

1538
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,000
yeah I was expecting that it's hard to

1539
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,860
keep all those segments going it's hard

1540
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,500
to keep you all that [ __ ] happening you

1541
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,750
know all right we got off on to a really

1542
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,260
good ramble because of this email mm-hmm

1543
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:41,329

1544
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,870
