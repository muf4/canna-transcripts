00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,269
talked about this one on the show before

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,668
it's got that dark roast coffee flavor

16
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:35,070
it's got a delicious aftertaste and it's

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,649
got a great high that just makes me nice

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,509
and mellow nice and chill the high feels

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,489
like it settled in right above my eyes

20
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,808
kind of on my eyes putting pressure on

21
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,000
my eyes it feels like I got some weight

22
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,890
on my forehead it's got a super mellow

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,840
high to it this is going to be a fun

24
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,929
podcast so I'm smoking on the coffee

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,760
nectar from Green Dot labs I'm sure some

26
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,890
of you noticed that my voice sounds a

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,649
little bit funky for this episode that's

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,230
because I had way too much fun seeing

29
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,250
fish for three days this weekend that's

30
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,709
right I've been hyping it up on the

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,688
podcast for a few weeks now fish my

32
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,250
favorite band was in town for three

33
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,500
nights they were here Friday Saturday

34
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,180
and Sunday they were actually in Denver

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,618
or a Commerce City to be more specific

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,509
that's only about a hundred and thirty

37
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,509
miles from home so that's a super easy

38
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,250
three day adventure for myself a lot of

39
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,469
people travel across the country to go

40
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,450
see fish so just a hundred miles is not

41
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,489
a big deal to go see this band I have

42
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,829
traveled all over the place to go see

43
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,959
fish in the past you just to pack up the

44
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,879
old Ford Contour and Rob the dude and

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,039
myself would get in the car and just go

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,929
drive across the country and just learn

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,180
about life and experience the world and

48
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,520
see fish every night and then camp out

49
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,259
or get a filthy hotel somewhere then

50
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,938
wake up the next day drive to the next

51
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,129
show and do it all over again we do it

52
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,529
all summer sometimes we did it all fall

53
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,938
and a lot of the time fish would just

54
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,228
come straight through Colorado in the

55
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,898
winter so we just catch them on that

56
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,420
November run but summer tour aw man we

57
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,420
would pack up the car and just go for a

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,450
run so this year I headed up to Denver

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,829
on Friday got to see fish it was super

60
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,780
easy getting there parking was super

61
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,459
simple got in got to have a good time on

62
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,530
the parking lot got to take some dabs in

63
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,789
the lot got in got to see the show got

64
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,620
to sit with some of our friends from

65
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:14,939
comedy works for the show so that's all

66
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,890
a good time hanging out with the Comedy

67
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,150
Works crew got to hang out and enjoy the

68
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:19,378
fish show they played a bunch of great

69
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,700
songs you guys probably don't want to

70
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,568
hear about the song titles and stuff and

71
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,329
if you care enough you've probably

72
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,619
already seen the setlist so Chad to my

73
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,360
friend from Comedy Works for hanging out

74
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,519
on the first night the second night I

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,810
went back to that area looking to see if

76
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,129
I could see some friends I saw some

77
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,280
friends I grabbed some seats with them

78
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:37,109
we hung out we smoked the band started

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,459
it got too crowded right there I wanted

80
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,319
to dance I wanted to boogie

81
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,670
they were playing really good songs at

82
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,500
night they had a different sound that

83
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,030
night it's not common for not uncommon

84
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,079
for fish to have a different sound every

85
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,609
night they kinda have a different vibe

86
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,859
it came out with different energy I

87
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,439
wanted to get down and dance I kind of

88
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,879
loosened up I was enjoying my weekend so

89
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,469
I decided that I was going to abandon

90
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,729
the pretty good seats that I had with

91
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,408
some friends and I was gonna go find

92
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,238
some space by myself to where I could

93
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:02,189
stretch my long hippie arms out and

94
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,750
dance a little bit so I found a section

95
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,068
where there weren't any people there

96
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,900
were just no people there and I kind of

97
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,369
went there and kinda just started

98
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,230
groovin and seeing if anybody would kick

99
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,030
me out and nobody said anything about me

100
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,009
standing in this big empty aisle area

101
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,628
just dancing like a hippie so I'm just

102
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,158
spinning around dancing the next thing I

103
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,209
know a bunch of other hippies have

104
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,739
gathered around and we're all just

105
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,049
having a good time right there so

106
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,120
section 104 became kind of little dance

107
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,709
party up at the top it's fun to be down

108
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,879
in the front where the band is real loud

109
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,379
and all the energy is down there but

110
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,060
it's a little crowded I'm kind of a big

111
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,098
dude and I got long-ass dreadlocks I'm

112
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,090
spilling people's beer with my dreads

113
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,858
and [ __ ] and people are getting

114
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,780
frustrated at how tall I am and I want

115
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,609
to dance like a wook so I went to the

116
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,609
back and had a really good time I made a

117
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,730
bunch of friends so Sunday night I

118
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,139
decided to go back there why waste time

119
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,939
I went right back to where I knew there

120
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,409
was a party I didn't have to fight for a

121
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,120
seat because it's just standing space

122
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,918
right there anyway so you can go in late

123
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,930
you just go in right before the show

124
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,160
starts go grab a drink go get

125
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,049
comfortable right there the lights go

126
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
out the music starts smoke a little bit

127
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,310
have a good time so I found that spot

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,030
and made some new friends there and had

129
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,079
a really good time so fish place for

130
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,639
Betty come out they play for about an

131
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,870
hour then they take like a 20 or 30

132
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,129
minute break they come out and they do

133
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,780
like another hour and a half and then

134
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:14,219
they do an encore after that so they

135
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,139
came out they did their first hour I was

136
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,639
getting down there are a couple other

137
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,829
people getting down next to me and it's

138
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,650
set break I started a conversation with

139
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,210
some of them this young lady that I had

140
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:27,060
been dancing kind of with kind of right

141
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:28,859
next to for about an hour now

142
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,259
in conversation I found out that she was

143
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,790
in one of my favorite movies and I

144
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,099
didn't even realize it the whole time

145
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,389
I've been standing next to her and for

146
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
the whole concert so far I didn't

147
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,960
realize that this was an actress in one

148
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,570
of my favorite movies so it's kind of

149
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,819
fun to find out uh just through casual

150
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,449
conversation that she played a part in a

151
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:50,159
movie I've seen a thousand times so I

152
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,168
had to act like I was not starstruck and

153
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,270
had to keep the conversation going but

154
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,949
then the band came back up and they

155
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:58,109
killed it for the second half of Sunday

156
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,879
the whole weekend was great but Sunday

157
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,160
was my favorite of all three shows they

158
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,199
always say never miss a Sunday show the

159
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,360
first half of sunday they played some

160
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,009
great songs the second half of Sunday

161
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,650
they played great songs and the jams

162
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,680
were insane so Sunday was a great show

163
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:15,750
then we walked out of the show after the

164
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,689
show was over and there was a marching

165
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,180
band playing fish tunes there's a dude

166
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,589
with a giant bass drum beating the bass

167
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,389
drum with malice there's a guy with a

168
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,978
marching snare there were a couple other

169
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,470
guys with percussion instruments and

170
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,288
then a nice horn section blowing out

171
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,510
fish tunes on horns New Orleans style it

172
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:35,069
was super cool we got down to that for a

173
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,990
long time we just stood in the parking

174
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,490
lot and just dance to that smoked a

175
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,150
couple of joints hit a vape pen a bunch

176
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,978
of times

177
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:42,509
I just watched everybody be hippies

178
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:44,009
watch everybody do nitrous and whatever

179
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,500
else they were doing and run around like

180
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,029
wooks and have a good time everybody was

181
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,709
just grooving in that area it was so

182
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,179
much fun

183
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:53,370
eat some parking lot pizza had some

184
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,459
parking lot burritos had a good time

185
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,060
there then the marching band ended and

186
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,620
we discovered the ball pit car I've

187
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,269
known about the ball pit car since I

188
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,889
lived in Lawrence Kansas the guys that

189
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,180
own the ball pit car were actually

190
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,319
friends of mine in Lawrence I guess

191
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,788
they're actually still friends of mine I

192
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,599
shouldn't say we're friends of mine but

193
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:12,120
these guys I've known them since

194
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,610
Lawrence Kansas they've got a car I

195
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,560
think it's uh it's like a truck it's

196
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,538
sort of like an El Camino or a Ranchero

197
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,418
I'm not exactly sure what it is it's

198
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,099
like a small truck with a long bed they

199
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:25,439
put a little liner inside of there they

200
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,180
put a little net around the thing like

201
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,889
you'd kind of put like a low net like

202
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,810
you'd put around a trampoline so nobody

203
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,759
flies out of it they put that net around

204
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,908
there and then they fill the bed of the

205
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,769
truck type vehicle with the balls that

206
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:40,709
you'd put in a ball pit at Chucky Cheese

207
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:41,269
so it is a ball pit car you can drive it

208
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,339
and

209
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,500
the ball pit active but they park it

210
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:47,598
they set up a pretty dope sound system

211
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,490
they hang a disco ball up above the

212
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,259
center of the ball pit and people dance

213
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,210
around the car while the cool music

214
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,009
plays they play a lot of Talking Heads

215
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:57,348
to tell you the honest truth ah they

216
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,060
dance around the car and then people

217
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,348
dive into the ball pit and roll around

218
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,788
on the ball pit and it's just a good

219
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:03,800
time it's just a fun little thing to

220
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,000
have kind of a sideshow attraction at

221
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,460
the fish show they're not involved with

222
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,110
the show or anything that's the beauty

223
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,788
and the magic of the fish parking lot

224
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,520
none of that is organized

225
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:15,408
that's just all done by fish kids that

226
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,299
have been going to fish shows for years

227
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:18,620
and years and years we've picked up the

228
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,960
culture from the Grateful Dead where

229
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,090
when the band goes on tour you buy your

230
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,198
tickets before they go on tour so if

231
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,758
they're going on summer tour you get

232
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,020
your tickets in the spring you start

233
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,759
booking all your hotels and all your

234
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,139
camping and then when the band goes out

235
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,270
you've got the car packed then you just

236
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,158
go to every show you go California you

237
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,568
go Oregon then you go down to Vegas then

238
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:37,219
you come through Colorado and then you

239
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,169
go wherever they go next you just travel

240
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,360
around with them so people have figured

241
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,519
out ways how to support themselves yes

242
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,710
people do sell drugs that's common it's

243
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,418
also very risky you can also sell food

244
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:50,239
you can sell shirts a lot of people are

245
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:52,519
selling hats fish hats grassroots hats

246
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,019
other random hats there are people

247
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,908
selling crystals are people selling

248
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,430
paintings there's a lot of artwork on

249
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:00,829
the lot a lot of just people selling

250
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,590
alcohol they set up a table so you can

251
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:05,120
and a lot of places won't allow us to do

252
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,619
this the woman we've gone to other

253
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,879
states in other cities we've been in

254
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,949
trouble for doing this and they shut us

255
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,658
down but the city of Commerce City was

256
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,620
very kind to us this time I guess I

257
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,819
should give them a shout-out they'll

258
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,769
never hear this but I think it's [ __ ]

259
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,050
cool that they allowed us to do this on

260
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:20,120
the premises on the premises at Dick's

261
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,908
in the parking lot there's a big dirt

262
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,598
parking lot area they let a bunch of

263
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:28,399
people set up tables and basically a

264
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,870
little pop-up tents little pop-ups like

265
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,339

cook-off festival or whatever kind of

267
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,429
festival you have downtown in your city

268
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,869
when everybody just or the cannabis cup

269
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,848

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,240
parking lot

276

287
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,220
out there it's all there and it's all

288
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,079
brought by kids who have been going to a

289
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,360
lot of shows and have learned that they

290
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,739
want to fund their way in sort of a

291
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,269
productive way they're providing a

292
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,769
service I got to eat because I dude was

293
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:20,509
sellin pizza and he got to go to the

294
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,310
next show because I spent six or seven

295
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,720
bucks at his booth so it kind of works

296
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,419
out we set up a little community there

297
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,889
and Commerce City let us do it they let

298
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,809
us set up our booths and van and they

299
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,850
let us just march around and be hippies

300
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:34,189
for three full days and they didn't bug

301
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,629
us at all so that was super cool if you

302
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,950
guys watched any of my Instagram live

303
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,230
feed you may have seen some of the

304
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,910
footage from the fish parking lot party

305
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,769
I was walking around and I showed a

306
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,629
little bit of the ball pit car party but

307
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:45,799
I was having conversation with some new

308
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,850
friends and I just wanted to end the

309
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,740
live feed and get back to the

310
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,240

00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,019
friends I can get some high fives you

328
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,420
can make new friends you could see old

329
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,949
friends one cool thing about the parking

330
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,719
lot is I was walking around doing laps

331
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,040
just seeing people listen to all the

332
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
music that people are playing seeing

333
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,909
what all the hippies are selling seeing

334
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,379
what's available I walked past the the

335
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,750
concert venue where the band was gonna

336
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,269
play and on Sunday I got there really

337
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,328
early and they were doing soundcheck the

338
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,559
band was checking the sound and playing

339
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:44,269
with their instruments and playing with

340
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,409
their gear on stage getting warmed up

341
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,698
for the show that night just to make

342
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:47,870
sure all the equipment sounds good

343
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:50,359
sometimes they want to go out on stage

344
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,820
and jam a couple new songs I got to hear

345
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,199
a really old song they don't play very

346
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,350
often you guys don't care what it was

347
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:58,789
but it was really cool to hear a song

348
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,409
that they don't play very often they

349
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:01,759
played a jam out of it and they ended

350
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,778
that and then they kind of tinkered with

351
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,850
their instruments and they just kept

352
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:06,110
playing just like little short jams I

353
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,909
think the keyboard player was trying to

354
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,399
dial in a new sound on his keyboard so

355
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,199
they were

356
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,699
they would play for a few seconds and he

357
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,210
would do his little keyboard part then

358
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,500
they'd stop and then you'd hear and kind

359
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,360
of tweak the sound a little bit and then

360
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,769
they'd go back to playing it again so it

361
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,430
was super cool hearing him do sound

362
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,230
check they played a really old song that

363
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,239
they don't play on stage I've never

364
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,409
heard Phish do it live and the hundreds

365
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,730
of years I've been listening to fish

366
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:31,019
I've been listening to tapes I've been

367
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,879
paying attention to live stuff they've

368
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,850
never done it that I've paid attention

369
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,970
to and they played part of it in a jam

370
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,649
during sound check and we all applauded

371
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,480
at the end of it and Trey the singer

372
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,610
laughed and he goes haha this is a

373
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,930
little song called catapult and it's

374
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,399
just really awesome that they played

375
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,349
that one and then he acknowledged us for

376
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,899
laughing or for applauding about it so

377
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,580
that was super cool then what else do I

378
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,500

397
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:34,710

light up when I talk about cannabis and

403
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,340
I saw that same light in this young

404
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,440
lady's eyes when she would talk about

405
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,210
cannabis her eyes would twinkle like it

406
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,430
was the best thing ever and it was fun

407
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,250
having a conversation with somebody who

408
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:58,319
loves cannabis as much as I do and I got

409
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,090

410
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,770

they said hey I saw you a fish but I

417
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,360

were talking to somebody I was probably

419
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,360

420

446
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,139
the same thing but as soon as they're

447
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,790

448
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,139

454
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,839
joint with you if I've got one left and

455
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,119
that's a good segue to talk about the

456
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,899
last part of my fish talk for this

457
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,230
podcast

458
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,639
it's Colorado right cannabis is legal

459
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,409
here we can all consume cannabis if

460
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,569
we're 21 and over we can possess consume

461
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,299
we can enjoy our cannabis however you

462
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,510
cannot take your cannabis into the

463
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,919
concert venue Dick's Sporting Goods

464
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,929
Stadium whatever it's called stick

465
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,370
Dick's Sporting Goods field that sounds

466
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,458
better Dick's Sporting Goods field it's

467
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,649
a giant soccer field they do not invite

468
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,359
you or encourage you or allow you to

469
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,759
bring in your cannabis or cannabis

470
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,579
products they were doing a very light

471
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,350
search on the way into the show they had

472
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,509
a metal detector and you've got to take

473
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,579
out all of your metal your phone your

474
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,838
lighter your car keys and put that in a

475
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,009
little basket and they slide that

476
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,870
through a little thing that goes past

477
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,730
the metal detector so it doesn't trigger

478
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,860
it then you walk through and if it

479
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,070
doesn't beep you're good to go so if

480
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,440
you've got a joint or a bunch of joints

481
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,550
or a baggie of weed in your pocket

482
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,899
you're gonna sneak right through that

483
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,639
thing it didn't care about that at all

484
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,490
so I took several joints every night

485
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,649
into the show however if you had a

486
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,329
backpack or some sort of a purse they'd

487
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,649
make you open your person unzip all the

488
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:27,750
pouches on the person they'd go through

489
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,948
that [ __ ] and I was why the line was

490
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,208
long and there are a lot of people so I

491
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:32,309
watched a lot of people get a lot of

492
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,319
[ __ ] taken from them ah they would open

493
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,639
up your purse and they would find a lot

494
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,180
of vape pens you

495
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,769
taken a nicotine or a cannabis vape in

496
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,879
they didn't want those in there so if

497
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,560
they found that they'd give you the

498
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,929
option to walk back to your car and put

499
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,939
it away or they wanted you to throw it

500
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,939
in a trash bag it was right there on the

501
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,860
ground and that bag was full a couple of

502
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,570
people were smart when they found their

503
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,220
vape pens and they didn't want to walk

504
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,320
back to their car like we can't throw it

505
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,329
away it would take a big-ass ripoff of

506
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,709
it and then pass it to the person in

507
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:03,599
line behind them and that person would

508
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,609
hit it and then just pass it back so

509
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,170
that vape pen would get consumed instead

510
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,539
of being thrown away which I thought was

511
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,889
very smart I actually got to hit one of

512
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,110
the vape pens that was discovered by

513
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,730
security and before that person threw it

514
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,139
into the trash bag they passed it in to

515
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,850
the people in line and I was like the

516
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,289
second or third person in line so I went

517
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,810
to one person and then it came to me and

518
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,759
I took a big fat ripoff of it and I just

519
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:25,559
passed that vape in down the line so it

520
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,480
got smoked it didn't go in the trash it

521
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,549
didn't make it into the show however but

522
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,289
all you had to do was put in your pocket

523
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:32,729
you could load your pockets up with

524
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,230
stuff and you could take it right into

525
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,490
the show so there were plenty of vape in

526
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,200
there's plenty of whatever in there I

527
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,060
smelled people smoking DMT and there I

528
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,620
smelled people smoke and plenty of weed

529
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,899
in there I could see the looks on

530
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,948
people's faces that plenty of [ __ ] made

531
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:50,309
it past security but the lady in line in

532
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:52,588
front of me on Sunday did not get her

533
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,549
mountain of [ __ ] edibles through

534
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,079
security I don't know what she was

535
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,629
thinking she had a little person when he

536
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,729
opened it up they sell edibles in

537
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:01,528
Colorado and it's like a giant film

538
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,360
canister it's a child proof container

539
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:06,240
semi childproof he squeezed it in the

540
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,849
lid pops open but they sell your edibles

541
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,318
in these types of containers and this

542
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,730
lady had like six of them in her purse

543
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,588
so the guy opens a purse and he just

544
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,808
grabs them because these aren't going in

545
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:17,789
and her husband or boyfriend or whatever

546
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:19,859
had already made it through security so

547
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,209
he's already in the show and she the

548
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,708
security guard is like you got to take

549
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,970
these back to the car throw him away

550
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,470
right here in front of me and she just

551
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,789
grabs him and stuffs him in her person

552
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,650
she's pissed off cuz she's got to go

553
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:30,779
figure this out and her husband's in the

554
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,250
show now but that security was not

555
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,149
letting her through with those so I

556
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,009
don't know what happened with the

557
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,330
edibles but they would not let you

558
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,740
through with edibles if they discovered

559
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:40,168
them they would not let you through with

560
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,910
them I had two water bottles in my

561
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,009
pocket and security didn't even notice

562
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,058
that so if you were discreet you could

563
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:47,849
probably get through there with whatever

564
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,990
you wanted if it wasn't metal and I

565
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,319
don't know how the vape pens weren't

566
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,778
setting

567
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,869
the metal detectors I saw a bunch of the

568
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:56,398
Green Dot vape pens in the show so they

569
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:58,528
were making it through security I also

570
00:17:56,398 --> 00:18:00,119
ran into one of the Green Dot reps

571
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,619

572

575
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,548

576
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,990

593
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:43,619
do I've been trying to get Mike over to

594
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:45,388
do some recording I'm not blaming Mike

595
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,788
I'm not calling my god I'm just saying

596
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:49,829
he's a new father and it's hard to not a

597
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:52,528
new father he's a new father again he's

598
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:54,418
double-timing it up so uh he can't come

599
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:56,490
over as frequently as I'd like him to to

600
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,440
record so if I can get him here Mike and

601

604

605
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,970

607
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,019
Jeff's cannabis school get back to the

608
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,548
education part of the show anyway you

609
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,048
guys I'm [ __ ] rambling today I feel

610
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,128
like those coffee nectar dabs are

611
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,480
starting to wear off I may have to do

612
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:21,329
another dab here pretty soon

613
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,919
but before we do that let's get to the

614
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:25,528
tweeter part of the show a few episodes

615
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,600
back I asked you if you could smoke a

616
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:30,929
joint with anybody who would it be

617
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:34,138
and I got a lot of great Twitter replies

618
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:37,379
a lot of people said they would like to

619
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:39,359
smoke with their father who has passed

620
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:41,189
away and that I kind of honestly

621
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,898
expected that answer from a lot of folk

622
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,058
because that just seems like something

623
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:47,128
that a lot of people would have wanted

624
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,509
to do like an opportunity maybe a lot of

625
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,709
young men were looking for that they

626
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,139
never got and that would have been a

627
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,819
really an opening opportunity would have

628
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:55,798
been a good icebreaker for maybe a

629
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,928
couple of men who didn't get along you

630
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,099
could consume some cannabis together and

631
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,778
loosen up and then you don't have to be

632
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,179
macho with each other so that may have

633
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:05,430
helped out with a lot of male relation

634
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,460
so our big respect everybody who reached

635
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,990
out and said that they wanted to that

636
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,480
their choice of who they would smoke

637
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,829
with dead or alive was their father who

638
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,180
was passed cuz it probably took some

639
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:16,799
courage to reach out and say that and

640
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,420
that's probably a sensitive moment so

641
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,180
thank you for sharing that with me and

642
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,509
I'm gonna try to dig in here and find a

643
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,039
few more of those replies before I read

644
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,259
the replies I'll actually read the tweet

645
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,759
that I tweeted on Twitter I said if you

646
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,710
could smoke a joint with any person

647
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,500
living or dead who would you choose if

648
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,299
the person you chose has passed which

649
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,059
era of that person's life would you

650
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:43,379
reanimate them from and it's an example

651
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:45,659
I said Jerry Garcia circa 1977 because

652
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,250
if you think about it if I said I want

653
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,990
to smoke a joint with Jerry Garcia right

654
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,119
now if he dug Jerry Garcia up and let me

655
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,349
smoke a john with him I've got had so

656
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,539
many years of his life I think he lived

657
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,679
53 years I got a lot of opportunity you

658
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,670
want to smoke with him as a little kid

659
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,259
when he didn't know [ __ ] about the

660
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,730
guitar you want to smoke with him with

661
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,990
height of his career do you want to

662
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,759
smoke with him at the end right before

663
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,930
he died when he had all of the knowledge

664
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,609
like which which option and I said circa

665
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,529
1977 at one point in Jerry's life I

666
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,899
think it was around the mid-80s about 84

667
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:15,779
Jerry slipped into a diabetic coma he

668
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,860
changed I would like to talk to Jerry

669
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,139
before that coma

670
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,179
also if I was gonna smoke with Jerry I'd

671
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,160
want to do it when he's like young and

672
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,850
hip and [ __ ] kind of my age I am now

673
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,210
and I think that was around 77 so Jerry

674
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:33,659
Garcia around 77 or my other example was

675
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,740
my Gramps in 1995 ish that era that's

676
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,110
when my gramps and I were really

677
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,120
clicking and I was adult enough I think

678
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:41,939
to have a good conversation with the old

679
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,319
man and he was still healthy enough to

680
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,000
have a good conversation with a young

681
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,599
man and we were getting along really

682
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,160
well at that point so uh I could smoke a

683
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,779
joint with any person living or dead

684
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:57,720
that it'd be a tough choice between

685
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:59,759
Jerry and 77 and my gramps in 95 then I

686
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,440
thought about it and if I wanted to get

687
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,940
realistic and smoke with somebody who is

688
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,630
alive and this was an actual opportunity

689
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,220
for myself my my reply was I've smoked

690
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,320
with most of my bucket list of stoners

691
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,539
but I love to smoke with Joe Rogan

692
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,129
before my time is up I've never smoked

693
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,109
with Joe Rogan I've seen him do comedy

694
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,480
I've been in the same room as him a

695
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,399
couple

696
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,890
times never consume cannabis but joe

697
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,320
rogan so that's something I would like

698
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,020
to do Joe Rogan it's probably probably

699
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,279
my number one option and Snoop Dogg is

700
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:29,168
up on that list and there are a few

701
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,879
other musicians and comedians I'd like

702
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,460
to smoke with but I think Joe Rogan is

703
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,030
my number one decision they're of a

704
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,990
living person I'd like to smoke with

705
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,548
then let's read some of the Twitter

706
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,679
replies now that I have set this up so

707
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:43,058
well my friend Clint Stewart what's up

708
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,580
Clint I hope you listen to this he's at

709
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:47,980
tall Clint on Twitter Clint said Trump

710
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:50,139
today to try and figure out what his

711
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,440
game plan is so Glantz to smoke a joint

712
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,900
with the POTUS with President Trump and

713
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,179
see what the [ __ ] his game plan is I'm

714
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,759
not sure how that's gonna go for either

715
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,769
one of them it may be awkward Clint's a

716
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,619
big dude you might wanna have a bunch of

717
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:06,400
Secret Service dudes around let's see

718
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,969
what else we got

719
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,790
Aldridge said my pops whenever wherever

720
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,069
I never got the chance thanks for

721
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:19,000
letting me share that Aldridge then our

722
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:23,619
friend at couch Glo said Terence Mckenna

723
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,269
in 1990 I really like that reply Terence

724
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,178
didn't smoke a lot of cannabis Terence

725
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:30,668
Mckenna was heavily into psychedelics he

726
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,160
was a an ethnos pharmacologist is what I

727
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,809
think he called himself and he did a lot

728
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,750
of hallucinogenic drugs a lot of

729
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:39,369
spiritual drugs but he wasn't a cannabis

730
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,710
consumer he said that the best way to

731
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:44,019
consume cannabis was to go for long

732
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,960
periods of time without consuming

733
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:49,329
cannabis and then when you do smoke as

734
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,519
much as you can possibly handle was his

735
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,750
theory on cannabis consumption he said

736
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,668
that's the way it worked the best for

737
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,950
him so smoking with Terence would

738
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,160
probably lead to some really crazy

739
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,650
conversations just to hear some of his

740
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,029
stories of going to other countries and

741
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,890
consuming some of the drugs that they've

742
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,740
offered him there some of the adventures

743
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,780
with his brother Dennis some of the

744
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,789
adventures with Terence Dennis and the

745
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,678
other scientists they used to travel

746
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:17,379
with doing drugs and experiencing other

747
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,840
cultures and doing drugs on small

748
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,400
islands with the indigenous people I'd

749
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,409
love to hear those stories with Terence

750
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,140
so that is a [ __ ] really good reply

751
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,940
thanks for that one then this guy says

752
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,620
he calls themselves free-market

753
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,450
capitalist it's not spelled the

754
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:34,449
natural way but I had spelled Twitter

755
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:37,240
way he says Ernest Hemingway in Paris in

756
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,490
the 20s that is quite an elegant answer

757
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,380
I want to know more about you because

758
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,390
that tells me you're a bright person on

759
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,370
that you've got good taste and that

760
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,920
you've got to have good conversational

761
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:49,419
skills for that one I'm impressed

762
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,670
you guys thanks for the great replies

763
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,800
it's never too late to send in a reply

764
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,960
to a Twitter question or a podcast

765
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,940
question I ask you once again if you

766
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,069
could smoke a joint with any person

767
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,769
living or dead who would you choose and

768
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,339
if that person you choose has passed

769
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,230
away

770
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:07,899
which era of that life would you

771
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,808
reanimate that person from and I've also

772
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,759
got a backup question for this if you do

773
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:15,639
get to smoke a joint with this one

774
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,619
person what strain would you choose to

775
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,770
smoke with your pick

776
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:24,329
send me a tweet is @gf wih podcast on

777
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,589
Twitter I would love to hear your reply

778
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,149
alright guys this podcast is getting

779
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:29,889
along and we haven't really talked much

780
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,360
about cannabis news education or

781
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,950
conversation we've talked about Twitter

782
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,259
stuff and we've talked about a Phish

783
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,279
concert I've got a little bonus nugget

784
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,629
here at the end of the show for

785
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,490
everybody that has stuck around this

786
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,010
long if you've listened to the show for

787
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,289
a while you know that a while back I did

788
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,539
an episode called email from a cop which

789
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,759
was followed by email from a cop part

790
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,710
two I got an email from a law

791
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,980
enforcement officer who wanted to give

792
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,960
us some cannabis tips and hints I read

793
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,349
his email people replied with more

794
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,450
questions then he replied with answers

795
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:04,359
to those questions now in a recent

796
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,789
episode somebody asked about keeping

797
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,829
your cannabis in your glove box is law

798
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:11,230
enforcement allowed to search your glove

799
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:13,389
box when you get pulled over I did not

800
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,429
have a solid answer but I knew my law

801
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,740
enforcement friend would be listening

802
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:20,590
and that he would chime in with feedback

803
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,349
so we've got an answer so here it is

804
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:25,089
email from a cop part three you guys he

805
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,129
said hey Russ - Jeff heard the question

806
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:30,009
about the glove box you were pretty much

807
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,570
spot-on and what I said was they can get

808
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,700
that [ __ ] open if they want to open it

809
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:36,159
they'll open it even if it's not legal

810
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,319
they will use their badge and their

811
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,940
[ __ ] to find a way to get into that

812
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,980
glove box and blame it on you is

813
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,029
basically what I said so he said you're

814
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,450
pretty much spot-on

815
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,668
if the

816
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,649
is probable cause there's very little

817
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,730
hesitation on the cops in to break open

818
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:51,788
a glovebox

819
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,558
in fact with probable cause refusing to

820
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:56,408
open the glovebox could be stretched

821
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,960
into delaying or obstructing you were

822
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:01,360
also right about the fake smell if cops

823
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,679
want in they are getting in so what are

824
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,479
you saying about the fake smell as I

825
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,769
said if the cops really want in your

826
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,599
glovebox they look at each other and

827
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,429
they go I smell marijuana no we've got

828
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,808
probable cause so that's the games that

829
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,538
the cops play and our law enforcement

830
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:15,190
friend says that we are accurate with

831
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:16,960
that so you guys don't keep your

832
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,700
cannabis in the glovebox and think that

833
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,169
you're safe don't keep anything illegal

834
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,000
in the glovebox and think that you're

835
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,710
safe from law enforcement if they think

836
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,119
that you've got something and they want

837
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,870
in that glovebox they will ask you to

838
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,518
open it if you do not open it you may be

839
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:32,558
delaying their investigation or

840
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,480
obstructing their investigation

841
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:35,888
depending on where you are the wording

842
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,360
will be different but you're gonna be

843
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,219
charged with basically the same [ __ ]

844
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,798
you're not complying you're making their

845
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,179
investigation harder on them and then if

846
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:45,009
you don't want to do that and they don't

847
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,288
want to mess with you for delaying or

848
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,690
obstructing they just say probable cause

849
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:51,579
it smells like marijuana in the car you

850
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,350
won't open the glovebox and for being a

851
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:54,908
dick I'm gonna get a crowbar and I'm

852
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,980
gonna pull this [ __ ] apart and destroy

853
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:58,750
your car so don't keep your stuff in the

854
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,250
glovebox don't put anything illegal in

855
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,929
there you honestly shouldn't have

856
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,669
anything illegal in the car if you've

857
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:06,130
got something the first rule let's let's

858
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:08,528
rewind here let's think about rule

859
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,539
number one only break one rule at a time

860
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:11,380
if you've got something in the car that

861
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:14,109
you're worried about law enforcement

862
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,630
finding drive like you were taking a

863
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,939
driving test the entire time you've got

864
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,799
something illegal in the car drive like

865
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,630
you've got something illegal in the car

866
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,308
don't do dumb [ __ ] to get yourself

867
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,320
pulled over play the music at an

868
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:29,440
acceptable volume come to a complete

869
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,778
stop at stop signs don't drive too fast

870
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,909
don't cut anybody off use your [ __ ]

871
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:36,638
blinkers use common sense

872
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:40,120
white Mike would teach us only break one

873
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:41,859
rule at a time always remember that you

874
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,259
guys so if the rule that you have chosen

875
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,449
to break is to have something illegal in

876
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,429
your vehicle don't break any other rules

877
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,899
so that that thing gets discovered now

878
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:52,120
if you insist on having something

879
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:53,768
illegal in the vehicle and I can't

880
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,359
advise that you do that I have to say

881
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:57,339
don't put anything illegal in your car

882
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,959
if you do though

883
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:00,548
don't put it in the glove box because

884
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,350
you're gonna reach in there to get your

885
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,028
license registration proof of insurance

886
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:06,428
you're gonna open up the glove box and

887
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:07,329
go register it your license is probably

888
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,980
in your wallet you're gonna go

889
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,749
registration proof of insurance in my

890
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,579
bag of weed here you go officer you're

891
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,230
gonna be [ __ ] and if you lock it and

892
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:15,759
they want in there they're gonna bust it

893
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,950
open and get it out and charge you with

894
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,019
obstruction now this email goes on he

895
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:24,038
says the only thing about the use of a

896
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:27,099
dog is it cannot prolong a traffic stop

897
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:30,278
longer than a reasonable time to write a

898
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:32,589
ticket for example if you get stopped

899
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,859
and the reason is a taillight out and

900
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:37,839
the cop calls a dog over and 45 minutes

901
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:42,658
later the dog arrives and alerts well

902
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:46,269
then you have been unlawfully D laid so

903
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:49,210
the cops can only hold you there for a

904
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:51,759
reasonable amount of time to write a

905
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,230
ticket so if you were pulled over for

906
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,019
having a taillight out or because you

907
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,610
were speeding that cop can only keep you

908
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:59,710
there long enough to write you that

909
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:01,808
ticket and then he is supposed to let

910
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,519
you go he can't hold you there forever

911
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:05,408
if it takes a long time for that dog to

912
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,519
get there now they're a bunch of stupid

913
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:08,590
catches too this

914
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,929
maybe he's writing your ticket and it's

915
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:13,089
taking a really long time for dispatch

916
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:14,649
to run your ID that happens all the time

917
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,849
if you ever notice if you get pulled

918
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:18,398
over in you're late for work and you're

919
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,829
speeding the cop says I'm just gonna run

920
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,339
your stuff it takes four [ __ ] ever to

921
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:26,378
run your stuff if it's late at night and

922
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,269
they're looking for somebody and you get

923
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:29,469
pulled over and then run your stuff it

924
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:30,999
only takes a couple of minutes because

925
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,379
they want to run your [ __ ] and get back

926

929
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,619

and maybe that cop dog is just driving

946

rules but so are we and we all know how

972
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:54,310
rule of thumb for prohibition land don't

973
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:56,289
be riding dirty so the best rule of

974
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,210
thumb is don't be riding dirty and if

975
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:02,170
you insist on riding dirty only break

976
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:04,539
one rule at a time he ends the me email

977
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,789
by saying peace and love all be safe out

978
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,440
there and then he sends me a little

979
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:09,970
personal note that I'm not going to

980
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,130
include here but dude that's a great

981
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,630
ending to that email I appreciate that

982
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,850
hey man thanks for the greedy mail I

983
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,370
want to add to this you guys obviously

984
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:20,500
not all law enforcement or terrible

985
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:23,229
people this guy is law enforcement and

986
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,359
he's giving us advice on how to not get

987
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,710
in trouble so I think the first thing

988
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,269
you should do if you get pulled over is

989
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,340
try to play the nice guy role with the

990
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,859
cop try to be respectful try to be

991
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:35,319
polite and maybe you will do the same

992
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:37,750
thing if not then you can adjust your

993
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,069
conversation as needed but start the

994
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,410
conversation off polite and friendly

995
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:43,089
take off your sunglasses look him in the

996
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,759
face hand him your license registration

997
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:48,429
proof of insurance be an adult about it

998
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,470
if the first thing I said to you and we

999
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,970
met was what the [ __ ] do you want we're

1000
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,890
not gonna have a good conversation no

1001
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,660
matter what I had in mind if the first

1002
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,790
thing I say to you when we meet is good

1003
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,440
afternoon sir how can I help you our

1004
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:01,059
conversation may go a little bit better

1005
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,580
you get to determine a lot of the

1006
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:06,220
interaction so try to be polite try to

1007
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:07,990
be friendly the only things you really

1008
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,940
need to be saying to law enforcement are

1009
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,410
yes sir and no sir

1010
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,740
other than that you're just digging

1011
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:16,840
yourself a hole I'm a big dude I'm six

1012
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,309
foot five in nearly 200 pounds I'm

1013
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,619
getting skinny lately but I'm still a

1014
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,769
big dude I can be intimidating to law

1015
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:23,419
enforcement

1016
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:25,400
if you're a big dude keep that type of

1017
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,800
stuff in mind especially if it's a

1018
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,210
little cop big guys make a little cops

1019
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,190
nervous and they've got something to

1020
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,870
prove so they get shaky around us and

1021
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,150
they gotta keep an eye on you and they

1022
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:36,469
get squirrely so keep that kind of stuff

1023
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,870
in mind when you're dealing with law

1024
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,900
enforcement but keep in mind you get to

1025
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:44,179
dictate a lot of the way the interaction

1026
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,950
goes there are some cops out there that

1027
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,920
are gonna [ __ ] your day up no matter how

1028
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,140
you act but not all of them want to ruin

1029
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,600
your day or life we've obviously got one

1030
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,280
friend here who's helping us out so the

1031
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,199
first thing we keep in mind is don't

1032
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,450
write dirty if at all possible

1033
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,759
the back-up plan if you're gonna write

1034
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,590
dirty only break one rule at a time and

1035
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,029
you've chosen to write dirty that's the

1036
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:06,889
rule we're gonna break today now we got

1037
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,659
to do the speed limit got to come to a

1038
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,669
complete stop at every stop we got to

1039
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,380
use the turn signals drive like your

1040
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,299
mama's in the car and she's gonna smack

1041
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,840
the [ __ ] out of you if you get crazy now

1042
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,640
if you do get pulled over be respectful

1043
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,919
and polite to law enforcement

1044
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,730
don't make any jittery moves don't reach

1045
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,079
for [ __ ]

1046
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,329
try to have your license registration

1047
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,559
and proof of insurance ready for law

1048
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,239
enforcement when they approach the

1049
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,668
vehicle have the windows down have your

1050
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,529
hands visible have your paperwork and

1051
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:35,059
your hands when he says license

1052
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,830
registration proof of insurance be able

1053
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:38,269
to hand it to him with a smile if you're

1054
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:39,860
wearing sunglasses take them off and

1055
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:41,269
look them in the eye be like look I

1056
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,750
ain't got [ __ ] to hide here's my

1057
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,219
paperwork here's my face here's Who I am

1058
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,469
comply with them don't give him any

1059
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,809
reason to tase mace or shoot your ass

1060
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:53,449
you don't need any of that say yes sir

1061
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:55,369
and no sir and don't consent to anything

1062
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,019
you're not comfortable with try to

1063
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,509
remember that every question they ask

1064
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,369
you is a trap and it two or three

1065
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,810
questions after that question is going

1066
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:04,549
to be the same question worded

1067
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,429
differently to try to get you to [ __ ] up

1068
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,990
so just don't talk yes sir and no sir is

1069
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:10,219
plenty of information for law

1070
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:11,329
enforcement they don't need to know much

1071
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:13,579
else you don't have to tell them

1072
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:15,409
anything else only tell them what you're

1073
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,599
comfortable with and if you decide at

1074
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,819
any time you've said enough you can stop

1075
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,960
talking you have the right to remain

1076
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,300
silent

1077
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,210
you know why because anything you say

1078
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,610
can and will be used against you in a

1079
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,150
court of law so keep your mouth shut

1080
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:33,050
yes sir I know sir is enough information

1081
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,760
because I feel like I need to make a

1082
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,410
disclaimer that I am NOT a lawyer I've

1083
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,230
never been to

1084

go to court with any Rasta Jeff legal
