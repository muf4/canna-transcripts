huge shout out to them one thing I want

89
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,000
to do on this podcast is check out a

90
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,840
video that somebody sent to me of three

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,199
x cops smoking weed and the video is 6

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,840
minutes long I'm going to watch the

93
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,479
whole thing I may edit parts of this out

94
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,400
of the podcast so that you guys don't

95
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,039
have to sit through six whole minutes I

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
may skip through parts of it we'll see

97
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,079
how my ADD kicks in as we do this but I

98
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,679
think this is a great video we're going

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,959
to watch parts of it and then we will

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,280
talk about it so let me kill the theme

101
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,120
song and we are going to play this cops

102
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,598
smoking weed video so it starts off with

103
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,799
some dub Steppy music I don't know what

104
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,079
that's called but some really uh some

105
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,480
music and it shows three older dudes old

106
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,080
enough to be our fathers uh taking bong

107
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,518
rips and then here's what they have to

108
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,000
say the last time I smoked was in

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,560
probably

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,759
1968 when I was in college first time I

111
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,959
smoked I was 14 years old uh I got

112
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,158
caught the first time I smoked

113
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,079
so and for some reason Kos on that for a

114
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,280
while tried it once and tell you I was

115
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,599
on a water bed with a very agreeable

116
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,878
woman and listening to RAB cidan blue

117
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,158
which I know lasts for about 18 minutes

118
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,438
and 40

119
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:18,238
seconds and it lasted for oh hell two or

120
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:20,040
three hours okay re-extend now the left

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,518
so all three of these xcops have just

122
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,400
admitted to having used cannabis

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,199
illegally in their life and now what

124
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,918
they're doing is taking a uh field

125
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,160
sobriety test before they smoke any

126
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,159
cannabis so there are three retire cops

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
they all know how to [ __ ] with each

128
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,560
other and give each other a sobriety

129
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,120
test this one old guy has got such

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,079
shitty old knees that he can barely pass

131
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,439
the heel to tow walk but this says also

132
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,159
that it was recorded in Washington where

133
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,079
cannabis is legalized so they're keeping

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
these cops out of trouble uh cop number

135
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,399
one now they're in plain clothes they

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
don't look like cops their facial hair

137
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,638
looks like cops you guys PL clothes guy

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,840
number one is now hitting the bong he

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,240
had the presenter of the video light it

140
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:59,758
for him and now we'll let I graduated

141
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,240

00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,839
you hear what theying right at first

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
because I think I had stuck on my

167
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,839
mustache or

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,079
something Have you ever arrested someone

169
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,799
from you know I thought about that a lot

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,680
and as far as I can remember I never

171
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,600
arrested anyone for it but I took a lot

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
of pot away from people and threw it

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,680
away in front of them and I thought that

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
was a bigger deterrent than actually

175
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,079
writing a criminal citation I think it

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,038
should be legal I think it should be

177
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,959
more widely available for medical

178
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:21,240
reasons it's like the last piece of

179
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,198
prohibition so do you believe marijuana

180
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,680
is a Gateway Drive I think it certainly

181
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
can be a Gateway this is my favorite

182
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,000
part like to respond to that too because

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,039
I'm going to pause it cuz uh the um the

184
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,720
host is a little a little bit hard to

185
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,879
hear on this show he's his audio is

186
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,840
terrible so what the guy just asked

187
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,079
these cops is do you think marijuana is

188
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,719
a gateway drug and I'm going to back up

189
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,719
about just a couple of seconds here

190
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,759
because this is honestly my favorite

191
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,120
part of the video is this guy's answer

192
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,759
okay so they just asked him do you think

193
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,840
marijuana is a gateway drug and I'll hit

194
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,800
play Do You Believe marijuana is a

195
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,000
gateway drug I think it certainly can be

196
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,240
a gateway drug yes I'd like to respond

197
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,160
to that too because if you look at it

198
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,519
everyone who's a heroin addict started

199
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
out drinking milk

200
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,038
so you're saying game apparently I mean

201
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,359
that's the argument about marijuana and

202
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,878
I'm not sure that's true so that guy

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,479
just said that milk is the gateway drug

204
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,280
you guys because everybody that started

205
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:17,079
that does heroin started off drinking

206
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,399
milk I don't know if he really feels

207
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,758
that way or if he's just too high and

208
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,318
hasn't been high in years and that's

209
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,000
what just came out of his head but that

210
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,199
was my favorite statement from this

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,079
whole video I was hearing that cop say

212
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,680
that everybody that is on heroin started

213
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,918
off using milk so milk is the gateway

214
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,400
drug also the one cop said he's never

215
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,240
arrested people but he's taken a lot of

216
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,399
weed away from people uh that's

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,360
respectable his job was to arrest people

218
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,519
for weed and he didn't do it so he's

219
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,400
kind of on our team a little bit the

220
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,878
other cop said it should be legal and it

221
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,279
should be more readily available for

222
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,840
medical purposes so I applaud these cops

223
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,638
so far let's keep watching this video uh

224
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,359
now this is 15 minutes later I don't

225
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,639
know if this is 15 minutes from the time

226
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,280
they took the bong hit or if this is 15

227
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
minutes from the clip that we just saw

228
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,478
which would put them about 20 minutes

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
into this stoned Adventure so I'm going

230
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,318
to hit play turn the volume up again and

231
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,959
we will see what these old guys are up

232
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,800
to and that's the

233
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,279
clock so now they're smoking a joint

234
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,319
they're hitting the bong showing a

235
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,959
montage now 25 minutes later starting at

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,199
93 count backwards by seven and now

237
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,638
they're going to try to do sobriety

238
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,120
tests 9 uh

239
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,759
86 and the question he just asked him is

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,918
[ __ ] up he said starting at 93 count

241
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,000
backwards by sevens your right fo I

242
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:37,838
can't do that so okay hold it for 20

243
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,879
seconds count oh count to 10 okay how

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,120
about

245
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,719
five so now they're doing the uh hold

246
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,240
your leg up test and the guy couldn't do

247
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,760
5 Seconds this one guy he did pretty

248
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,480
good doing the Heel To Toe test better

249
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,240
than before yeah he said better than

250
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
before uh this dude was doing a heel to

251
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,080
toe test a minute ago and I said that he

252
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,319
was [ __ ] it up cuz his knees were so

253
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,959
bad now that he smoked a little bit of

254
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,480
reefer this dude just nailed the Heel To

255
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,518
Toe test cuz his pain doesn't hurt in

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,440
his knees anymore so they accidentally

257
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,519
found a good reason to use marijuana all

258
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,279
right I'm going to hit play on the video

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:13,078
again we'll keep going I feel a little

260
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:15,480
floaty it's not unpleasant but it's

261
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,958
shadowed by

262
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,120
The Faint discomfort of not being

263
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,958
fully whatever that's kind of what

264
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,600
police officers do they're very staunch

265
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,359
they're very in control all the time

266
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,000
this doesn't necessarily allow you to do

267
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,399
that is actually pretty comfortable

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,120
though I mean it's it's relaxed and I

269
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,639
don't feel like I have to be in control

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,240
it's it's pretty cool so this guy's

271
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,838
enjoying it and this is 45 minutes lat

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
legalizing marijuana is that it it takes

273
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,040
I mean some of the stuff you can buy in

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,639
the street now you never know what it's

275
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,000
cut with I don't agree with that he's

276
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,120
claiming that marijuana is cut with

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,078
stuff which is weird but that's his own

278
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,039
uneducated you know he doesn't know

279
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,679
where it came from and what it's going

280
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,559
to do to you well yeah and it also costs

281
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,599
you know more to put somebody in in

282
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:05,039
prison not jail but prison uh then it

283
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,360
cost to send them to Harvard you hear

284
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,039
that it costs more to put somebody in

285
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,278
prison than to send them to Harvard now

286
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,799
they're playing the game where you put a

287
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,838
card on your name and try to guess who's

288
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,519
what not we're going to skip part of

289
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,800
this it's unnecessary but you guys I

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,039
don't know given in the right

291
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,479
circumstances they just asked I'm going

292
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,120
to back up two seconds they just asked

293
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,480
would you do it again is the question

294
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,200
and here's their respones I'm letting

295
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
the YouTube video load well I told my

296
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,360
son on the way over here I was I had a

297
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,838
pretty good headache coming on and I

298
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,839
think my headache starting to clear

299
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,240
clear up I mean it's going away would

300
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,639
you do it

301
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,839
again I don't know given in the right

302
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,200
circumstances I suppose yeah I'll smoke

303
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,920
again probably given the opportunity so

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
all three of these guys said they will

305
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,759
smoke again the video with you guys

306
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,159
taking one and since that was their

307
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,838
answer he wants them to hit the bong one

308
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,679
more time so they're all going to take

309
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,959
now this is great they're doing a

310
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,958
montage of these three older dudes

311
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,919
taking bong hits and smoking a joint and

312
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,039
it looks like uh like they're trying to

313
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,078
make it a scene from uh The Hangover or

314
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,439
something it's pretty good all right so

315
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,679
I'm gonna wrap up this video because I

316
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,360
honestly don't know how much I was

317
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,199
allowed to play of that video without

318
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,680
some sort of usage rights let me give a

319
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,920
shout out to the person that posted it I

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,359
sure you check it out guys it's a funny

327
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,800
video you're going to want to watch it

328
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,159
yourself all right now that we've gotten

329
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,359
through watching that video let me talk

330
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,120
about it a little bit uh one thing I

331
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,959
really liked is that these dudes seemed

332
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,278
open-minded they didn't remind me of a

333
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,919
lot of the cops that I've dealt with

334
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,759
that are real standoffish and think they

335
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,240
have to be in control of everything the

336
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,000
One Cop actually said that that's a

337
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,600
cop's job is to be in control and once

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,399
he smoked a little bit of reefer he

339
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,639
wanted to relax and lighten up and not

340
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,000
be such a prick of a cop so I liked that

341
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,039
he was open-minded and wanted to

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,679
participate I like that the one guy said

343
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,838
it should be legal and then what I

344
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,919
really liked was that they all wanted to

345
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,800
smoke again they said yes we would do

346
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,679
this again so maybe the those cops are

347
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,120
going to go talk to one of their friends

348
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,439
who is still a cop and be like you know

349
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,360
what dude we got Stoned on this video

350
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,600
and it's not as bad as you think maybe

351
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,680
one of their friends is going to watch

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,360
this video maybe this video is going to

353
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,638
help people change their opinions of

354
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,240
cannabis and even if it even if you're

355
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,278
already a fan of cannabis I recommend

356
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,959
watching it because it was highly

357
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,600
entertaining big shout out to whoever

358
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,879
sent that video to me I do not remember

359
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
who it was but I appreciate it all right

360
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,240
that's enough of the video I've got a

361
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,198
few news articles that I'd like to share

362
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
with you guys um this article we'll just

363
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,599
jump right to it this article comes from

364
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,359
the PUO then and it is written by uh Dan

365
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,759
cinta no it's actually written by

366
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,680
Kristen M white so the headlin says

367
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,319
extra marijuana tax money set to hit the

368
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,439
roads and I've talked a little bit about

369
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,639
this in previous shows and it is finally

370
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,079
happening this was my recommendation and

371
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,759
now here you go here's the article you

372
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,000
guys it says the pbla West Metropolitan

373
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,439
District will spend an additional

374
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,639
$200,000 on roads in the community for

375
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,279
the remainder of the year in a

376
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,360
three-fold approach that Public Works

377
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,919
director Dan cinta outlined for the

378
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,000
board recently the extra money comes

379
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,838
after directors agreed to allocate the

380
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,958
$200,000 it received from PLO County for

381
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,440
marijuana tax money toward chip sealing

382
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,198
already planned this County will pay the

383
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,880
$200,000 directly to its Emulsion

384
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:19,039
supplier freeing up 200,000 PLO $200,000

385
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,720
PLO West would have spent of its

386
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,919
$350,000 budget for chip sealing this

387
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,120
year the highest need we have in the

388
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,639
district right now has to do with gravel

389
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,480
roads CA told directors we have 6.2

390
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,600
miles of gravel roads that when we have

391
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,720
the storms we've had this spring the

392
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,040
clay underneath fails and some stretches

393
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
are impassable it would be our intent to

394
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,759
start attacking the repair of those

395
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,839
roads as soon as possible we propose to

396
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,759
bring in additional staff equipment and

397
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,240
additional gravel so I have recommended

398
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,639
this several times you guys I've said

399
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,839
that we should take all this tax money

400
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,120
that we're making here in Pueblo

401
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,720
Colorado and fix some of the goddamn pot

402
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,278
holes all over the roads well guess what

403
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,240
they have heard us the people have

404
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,078
spoken the people listened and now they

405
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,039
going to fix the roads with all of that

406
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,879
tax money so big shout out to the city

407
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,838
of peblo for actually doing something

408
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,000
about the roads of course they're

409
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,120
starting with dirt roads that are

410
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,198
impassible but once those are done

411
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,198
they're going to fix the potholes in my

412
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,359
city so that my car will not sound like

413

423
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,919
this article uh the headline is raising

424
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,879
the bars for pot and this is something

425
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,559
else that we've been talking about and

426
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,000
hinting at on the podcast and things are

427
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,439
finally coming around so the sub

428
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,399
headline says Denver campaign promoting

429
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,839
promoting use in 21 in over 21

430
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,559
establishments uh this article is by

431
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,320
Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press

432
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,319
and then it says Denver beer wine or

433
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,240
weed campaign is underway to ask Denver

434
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,199
voters about owing marijuana consumption

435
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,079
in bars and other places that only allow

436
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,799
people over 21 activists who campaign

437
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,479
for recreational pot legalization in

438
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,679
Colorado have launched a petition to

439
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,000
drive what they call limited social

440
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,519
marijuana consumption at bars the

441
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
activists need about 5,000 signatures to

442
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
get the question on November ballots it

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,278
would allow bars or clubs to allow

444
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,120
marijuana use as long as patrons bring

445
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,120
their own weed and comply with clean air

446
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,039
laws that means the pot they consume

447
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,039
would have to be edible or if smoked

448
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,360
consumed on an outside patio the way

449
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,039
cigarette smoking is regulated now

450
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,720
outdoor smoking sites would have to be

451
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,679
shielded from public view so if you guys

452
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
don't know about the Clean Air Act in

453
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,799
Colorado you are not allowed to smoke in

454
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,198
a restaurant or anywhere that serves

455
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,758
food or basically where the public is

456
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,758
you have to get a um [ __ ] I don't know

457
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,600
the word uh tobacco shops have them but

458
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
you have to get like a a smoking license

459
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
like a tobacco shop or a cigarette shop

460
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,639
if you want to smoke in there they apply

461
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,360
for a permit and you're able to smoke in

462
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,278
there um so with the clean act we are

463
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,000
not able to smoke cannabis inside of a

464
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,639
building even if they do allow it we're

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,399
going to have to step outside to an

466
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,000
outdoor area that is shielded from

467
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,720
public view so I'll jump into the

468
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,278
article a little bit more here it says

469
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,440
marijuana is now I don't how they I

470
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,879
don't like how they worded that I'm

471
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,560
going to read it the way it should have

472
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,198
been written it says marijuana is now a

473
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,078
legal product for adults in Denver and

474
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,719
it's really time that we give adults a

475
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:25,519
place to use it legally and socially

476
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,920
said Mason tvert who ran Colorado's 2012

477
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,600
campaign to legalize recreational pot we

478
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,240
shouldn't be requiring that you sit at

479
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,360
home if you choose to use marijuana as

480
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,639
an adult and I completely agree with

481
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,318
that you guys there are so many places

482
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,600
to buy dank buds in Colorado but there

483
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,240
is nowhere to legally go smoke it so

484
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,000
this would change a lot of things and I

485
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
think it would promote business people I

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,318
wouldn't go to a bar I have no reason to

487
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,799
go to a bar I don't drink alcohol I

488
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,198
don't want anything to do with bar girls

489
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,838
I don't want to do with bar dudes I

490
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,278
don't like drunk people but if I could

491
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,600
go to that club and hang out and take a

492
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,399
couple of dabs and hang out with my

493
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,040
friends that are drinking I would be way

494
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,440
more inclined to go to the bar and then

495
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,439
I'd spend a few bucks there because I'd

496
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,160
have to buy a soda or some sort of juice

497
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,839
or [ __ ] to keep my mouth hydrated while

498
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,439
I'm dabbing but anyway we'll keep going

499
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,439
with the article Colorado law prohibits

500
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,519
recreational pot consumption openly and

501
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,880
publicly or in a matter that endangers

502
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,558
others it does not however bar against

503
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,319
consumption in private over 21 clubs the

504
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,359
Denver measure would clarify what counts

505
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,720
as a private club and that's something

506
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,159
we've been struggling with here a lot in

507
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,759
Colorado is getting a private club uh

508
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
marijuana dispensaries are banned from

509
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,798
allowing onuse uh on-site use of

510
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,519
products they sell and from selling

511
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,359
alcohol or food that doesn't contain pot

512
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,879
the Denver proposal would only allow

513
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,639
bring your own consumption uh Denver

514
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,320
wouldn't be the first city to allow

515
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,240
Marana in bars Netherland has a state

516
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,759
statute allowing limited on-site

517
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,440
consumption at over 21 clubs so in Ned

518
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,679
you can go smoke I didn't know about

519
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,038
that uh in Colorado Springs the state's

520
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,000
second largest city has several

521
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,000

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,319
tolerated if not specifically Allowed by

523
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,200
Statue Colorado Springs Mayor John

524
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,079
suthers has told the city council that

525
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,080
he plans to see regulations on the clubs

526
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,359

going to one of those places it's

545
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,319
actually pretty damn fun I ended up at a

546
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,279
kind of a secretive place in Denver

547
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,200

551
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,759
really enjoy it for some reason all

552
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,879
right I need to continue with this

553
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,359
article uh where are we uh the Denver

554
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,200
petition comes after that City rejected

555
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,599
pot friendly bars uh Denver has several

556
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,840
underground clubs where patrons use

557
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,879
marijuana for a joining fee but the city

558
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,639
has intermittently arrested people for

559
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,360
public consumption at those

560
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,480
clubs arresting for smoking weed again

561
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,798
wait I thought we were past that anyway

562
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,279
the raids and arrests leave tourists

563
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,679
with nowhere to legally consume pot

564
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,798
they've bought argued supporters of the

565
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,559
ballot measure among the supporters is

566
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,279
Jane West an events promoter who last

567
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,079
year arranged classically cannabis

568
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,158
concert with the Colorado Symphony

569
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,038
Orchestra the city threatened to block

570
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,760
the concert citing public consumption

571
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,279
laws the symphony rebranded the concerts

572
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,158
as a private bring your own cannabis

573
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,319
fundraiser and the city dropped its

574
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,200
objections uh West was convicted of a

575
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,038
misdemeanor for organizing a separate

576
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,440
cannabis friendly event last year a

577
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,960
brunch at a bakery an eight-person SWAT

578
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,038
team descended on the event and shut

579
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,480
down the brunch West said Wes became one

580
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:54,240
of the first to sign the Denver petition

581
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,558
the petitions are due by early August so

582
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,319
uh where's this petition because

583
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,480
everybody here in Colorado needs to sign

584
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,798
this if you listen to this podcast you

585
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,319
agree with me that we need to allow

586
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,879
recreational consumption in 21 and over

587
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,158
establishments for adults out of public

588
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,799
view out of indoor smoking areas so that

589
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,280
we're able to medicate if we're a

590
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:15,519
medical patient or we're able to

591
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,918
recreate if we're a recreational smoker

592
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,319
we should be able to Puff the people are

593
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,919
at the bars getting wasted doing shots

594
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,439
[ __ ] getting drunk getting into

595
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,480
fights raping each other being heathens

596
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,558
but the people that want to smoke a

597
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,120
little bit of weed and relax are being

598
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:31,240
singled out and I think it's sucks and

599
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,199
it's time for a revolution it's time for

600
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,919
us to be able to smoke in these clubs

601
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,480
where we want to go I think it' be a

602
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,038
good idea I think it's kind of dumb that

603
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,679
they don't allow it all right big shout

604
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,720
out to the PUO Chieftain big shout out

605
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,640

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,000

there's a link to it but there is not so

609
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,280
we need to find this petition somewhere

610
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,320
and we need to sign it each and every

611
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,519
one of

612
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,839
us so that's enough of that article

613
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,519
let's go to the next article this

614
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,158
article is a little bit long let me see

615
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,240
how much time I have got left here in

616
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:08,520
this show so um we've talked recently

617
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,960
about the discussion between the natives

618
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:14,759
and the government to allow natives to

619
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,200
grow cannabis on native land or Indian

620
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,519
reservations recently federal agents

621
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,000
have raided two major marijuana grows on

622
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,038
tribal County or on tribal land in modok

623
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,839
County so this article comes from where

624
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,240
is this this is actually from KCTV decom

625
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,798

to be a load of marijuana plants in its

638
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,679

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,278
processed marijuana other than the

652
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
Contraband marijuana and items of

653
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,440
evidentiary value no tribal property was

654
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,798
seized and no federal charges are

655
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,880
printing horwood said she explained that

656
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,679
the search warrants are part of an

657
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,440
ongoing investigation relating to the

658
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,038
financing and management of a commercial

659
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,759
marijuana cultivation project the

660
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:45,119
project warrant affidavits were unsealed

661
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:46,519
until today horwood also said that while

662
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,959
the US attorney's office doesn't

663
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,720
normally comment on ongoing

664
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,319
investigations because of the public

665
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,240
nature of this raid they are releasing

666
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,960
information she explained that marijuana

667
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,000
grows have received substantial

668
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,079
attention in modok County as well as the

669
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,880
US Department of Justice's guidance

670
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,918
relating to marijuana cultivation on

671
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,278
tribal lands the cultivation facility at

672
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,360
alterus Indian Ranch area was located

673
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:11,519
within the trib's former Event Center

674
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,519
with within approximately 100 yards of

675
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,918
the trib's publicly operated gaming

676
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,960
facility the Desert Rose Casino so these

677
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720
guys were growing a major grow 100 yards

678
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,000
from the Desert Rose Casino where people

679
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,000
go all day and gamble all day that's

680
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,159
kind of kind of funny to me uh the

681
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,119
facility on the XL Ranch was next to

682
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,880
Highway 395 on the banks of the pit

683
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,918
River horwood explained that the pit

684
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,679
River facility consisted of 40 newly

685
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,440
constructed Greenhouse structures each

686
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,200
capable of accommodating appr

687
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,400
approximately 1,000 marijuana plants and

688
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,278
additional gable roof structures that

689
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,200
boosted the square footage of roof

690
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,519
covered structures by another

691
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,880
50% that is a lot of plants you guys

692
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,119
this dude had 40 green this operation

693
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,640
had 40 green houses with a thousand

694
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,519
plants each that's the potential of

695
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,038
40,000 plants in those green houses plus

696
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,278
stuff that was covered that increases

697
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,079
their Square footage by 50% which is

698
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:04,440
another 20,000 plants if you do it

699
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,158
mathematically I think all right I'll

700
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,640
keep going uh both of the grow

701
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,559
operations which appear to have been

702
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,000
operating in conjunction with each other

703
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,200
and were in excess of the locally

704
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,159
enacted marijuana cultivation limits

705
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,919
applicable to County Land horwood said I

706
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
feel like I read something of that uh

707
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,120
they were they were both in excess of

708
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
the locally enacted marijuana

709
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,079
cultivation limits so that's something

710
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,000
that's kind of if you're allowed to grow

711
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,798
cannabis if you're able to do that

712
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,960
legally without being [ __ ] with by the

713
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,240
government stay within your damn limits

714
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,399
why don't you just stay in the limits

715
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,599
these guys were over their limits

716
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:36,558
they're growing too much and that's what

717
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:38,798
got them in trouble which is a sign of

718
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,158
greed and selfishness and not growing

719
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,558
from your heart and growing from your

720
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,760
wallet all right we're going to keep

721
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:45,720
going on the article it says the volume

722
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,398
of marijuana that the XL facility alone

723
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,278
was capable of producing estimated

724
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,959
approximately 40 to 60,000 plants far

725
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,038
exceeds any prior known commercial

726
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,720
marijuana grow operation anywhere within

727
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,359
the 34 County eastern district she added

728
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,679
according to tribal Representatives all

729
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,599
of the marijuana cultivated at both both

730
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,600
facilities was intended to be

731
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,719
distributed off of tribal lands at

732
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,678
various unidentified locations according

733
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
to the search warrant affidavits the

734
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,679
investigation to date indicates both

735
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,960
operations may have been financed by a

736
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,200
third-party foreign National and you

737
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,759
guys I actually uh found these search

738
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
warrants on Facebook for some reason I

739
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,599
was scrolling through Facebook and

740
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,319
somebody happened to post the search

741
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,719
warrants and for some reason I was

742
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,839
completely enthralled with with reading

743
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
these search warrants and it was

744
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,959
completely entertaining for some reason

745
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,839
I could not get my head out of it but

746
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,640
they said that this thirdparty foreign

747
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,480
National was a guy from Canada who owns

748
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,038
Canadian cigarette companies who has got

749
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,919
a history of drug convictions so they

750
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:48,158
got a Canadian guy come to an Indian

751
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
Reservation who financed a major grow he

752
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
paid for everything they were supposed

753
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,839
to grow the Cannabis distribute this and

754
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,360
allegedly get him his portion and keep

755
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,158
the operation going um I was amazed that

756
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,918
I found the uh search warrants and all

757
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,520
of the stuff written up if you guys ever

758
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,120
get a chance to read a technical

759
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,359
document like that do it just for fun if

760
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,239

people are into that [ __ ] uh you'll get

762
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,558
a kick out of it it was really neat uh

763
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,038
they will not give the snitches names

764
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:14,759
they call them confidential informants

765
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,960
and give a long excuse why they keep

766
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,558
them confidential uh they talk about how

767
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,880
the raid happened they talk about so

768
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,278
many small details uh you guys will

769
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,640
start tripping out and wonder if you're

770
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,359
being watched when you listen if you

771
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,880
read a search warrant cuz there are so

772
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,918
many small details that these guys

773
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,960
[ __ ] up on they were getting their

774
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,799
pictures taken they were talking to

775
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,000
people and all of that [ __ ] is in the

776
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,558
police reports and in the search

777
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,720
warrants and you would never assume that

778
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,398
that shit's being told to police but so

779
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,798
much of it was yeah all right I'm going

780
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,479
to continue with the article if I can

781
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,918
find out where the hell I was all right

782
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,278
here we go according to horwood the

783
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,799
investigation of the cultivation

784
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,000
facility search today indicates that

785
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,720
both our commercial marijuana

786
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,720
cultivation projects operated with the

787
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,240
intent to transport large quantities of

788
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,480
marijuana off tribal lands for

789
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,440
distribution at various locations yet to

790
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,599
be identified by the tribes which is a

791
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,360
concern to the Department Department of

792
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,000
Justice because it goes against their

793
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,959
guidelines uh you know why it goes

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,558
against their guidelines because they

795
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,200
don't make any [ __ ] tax money off of

796
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,440
it that's part of the problem uh horwood

797
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,558
said that the US attorney's office

798
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,240
consulted with members and

799
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,000
representatives of both tribes which are

800
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,960
federally recognized on multiple

801
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,599
occasions before today's raid and

802
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,399
reminded the tribes that cultivation of

803
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,278
marijuana is illegal under federal law

804
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,918
and that anyone engaging in such

805
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,640
activity did so at the risk of

806
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,038
enforcement action she added they were

807
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,520
also concerned because the large

808
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,879
quantities violates federal law is it is

809
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,798
not consistent with California's

810
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,880
compassionate use act and undermines

811
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,519
locally enacted marijuana regulations so

812
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
basically you guys these guys got [ __ ]

813
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,879
because the the tribal laws and the

814
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,038
locals said you guys are growing too

815
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,600
much weed you're going to get in trouble

816
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:45,398
and guess what they went ahead and did

817
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,319
it and guess what they got dealt with by

818
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:49,479
the police it's a little bit ridiculous

819
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,200
don't [ __ ] around you guys if you're

820
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,079
allowed to grow cannabis if you're a

821
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
native if you're not a native whoever

822
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,599
you are if you're allowed to grow

823
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,798
cannabis don't throw it in their face

824
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,359
and grow too much just follow the rules

825
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,918
grow you're allowed to grow and be

826
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,599
thankful if you're in a non-legal state

827
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,960
do what you got to do I can't encourage

828
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,798
you either way but if you're in a

829
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
non-legal State and you need medicine

830
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,480
grow what you can do what you can be

831
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,278
careful don't get caught all right in

832
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,640
the search warrant that I read you guys

833
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,278
they listed all of the strains that

834
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,720
these guys were working with because

835
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,440
they P the way that a lot of this

836
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,519
started they pulled over one of their

837
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,159
transportation vehicles that was uh

838
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,079
transporting plants from one grow

839
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,600
facility to the other and this guy had

840
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,879
a, oneg pots uh with babies in his uh

841
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,678
rider truck truck or his Pinsky truck

842
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,360
and they listed off what he had and dude

843
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,159
they had blueberry cookies in there they

844
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,558
had platinum OG in there they had Girl

845
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,760
Scout cookies these guys had some Great

846
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:42,798
Cuts and I started thinking about it

847
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,599
natives the natives people we used to

848
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,079
call Indians when we were kids those

849
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,199
guys are an agricultural commu uh uh

850
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,918
culture all of their culture is based on

851
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,159
the earth and agriculture if these

852
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,519
natives that were growing these cannabis

853
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:01,440
plants were the natives that we think of

854
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,000
when we daydream about Indians uh those

855
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,399
guys in my mind would grow amazing

856
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,480
cannabis and I would love to have gotten

857
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,000
a sample of the [ __ ] that they grew I'd

858
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,919
love to see what the natives are growing

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,359
I bet it's [ __ ] dank just because

860
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,000
that's what they do they're outdoor

861
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,359
people they're connected with the Earth

862
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,960
they're connected with plants uh I could

863
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,639
assume that they grow some dank dank

864
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,038
weed sounds like they're putting out a

865
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,278
lot of it too all right what else do we

866
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:26,278
have um I think that's all the news

867
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,200
we're going to do because we are at 29

868
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,200
minutes and 50 seconds and my next news

869
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,720
articles are going to be a little

870
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,399
lengthy so they might go on the next uh
