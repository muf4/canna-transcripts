fresh new genetics to your garden and I

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,810
highly recommend Oregon elite seeds and

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,130
you can find them at www.seannal.com it

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,839
has become a tradition that we start

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,210
this podcast off by talking about what

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm smoking today I've been taking dabs

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,800
of fortissimo live batter from Green Dot

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,980
labs the label says this is a

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,109
combination of crescendo and HSB the HSB

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,509
I think is Han Solo Berger another

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,549
strain that I tried from Green Dot labs

17
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,710
recently that I really enjoyed the

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,589
flavor description here says 98 octane

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,270
and dumpster and that is ridiculously

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,730
accurate when you take the dab of this

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,920
it tastes like fuel and gas hitting your

22
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,988
tongue when you blow it out it smells

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,190
and tastes like hot dumpster then a

24
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,378
couple of seconds later there is a

25
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,808
garlicky feel sort of an aftertaste it

26
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,089
sounds disgusting I can't get enough of

27
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,739
it I was trying to describe the flavor

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,689
and aroma to somebody else and I said it

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,939
was like smoking a joint of gassy weed

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,039
right next to the dumpster for some

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,569
reason it is disgustingly delicious and

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,189
I really like the buzz from the

33
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,019
fortissimo it's kind of mellow it sits

34
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,089
me down most of the time I buy a

35
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,099
concentrate that makes my head spin this

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,759
has got me a little bit chilled out on

37
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:28,349
the back the label says it does contain

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:29,579
67.7 7% THC and it's 0% CBD so big

39

00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:48,060
this one goes like this what up Rasta

109
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,739
Jeff I hope you had a good 4/20 my 4/20

110
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,740
was perfect I couldn't have asked for

111
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,210
anything better I had a wonderful time

112
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,490
the message goes on it says mine has

113
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,800
been great looks like we both had a

114
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,460
great 4/20 so congratulations mission

115
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,890
accomplished

116
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,469
then it says first I took the largest

117
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,529
dab ever for me recently and that was

118
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:10,109
really intense it was at least a tenth

119
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,199
of a gram which is big for me huge in

120
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,700
fact it made me think of you this guy is

121
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,769
probably thinking of me when he takes

122
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,199
big dabs because on the dude grows

123
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,180
podcast I took kind of a semi large dab

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,579
in my Instagram videos I am known for

125
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,918
taking large dabs and in the past I have

126
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,639
done quite large dab videos some of

127
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,680
those may be

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,509
discoverable and searchable on YouTube

129
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm not sure but I am known for doing

130
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,439
gigantic dabs I've slowed that down a

131
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,029
little bit as I'm getting older as the

132
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,430
concentrates are better quality also

133
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,948
more expensive it's not necessary to do

134
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,139
a gram or a half gram dab however I

135
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,569
still bust out a quarter gram or half

136
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,310
gram dab on a regular basis sometimes

137
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,949
people think my normal dabs are quite

138
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,530
ridiculous so that's why the large dab

139
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,150
made our friend think of me he says as

140
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,948
soon as I blew out the smoke I got a

141
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,959
text and it sounded like a kitchen timer

142
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:01,110
perfect timing I looked at my buddy and

143
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,489
said I'm done and he just laughed so

144
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,560
this dude takes too big of a dab for

145
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,829
himself he blows out the smoke and then

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,930
he hears ding and he says I'm done bro

147
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,848
perfect just like some sort of a cartoon

148
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,560
just like a Bill and Ted episode you

149
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:15,300
nailed it bro good job I hope you and

150
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,629
your buddy laughter asses off it that

151
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,819
one

152
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,468
I also hope you choked and coughed for

153
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,810
like a good four minutes off of that dad

154
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:24,180
and got super high all right there is

155
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,000
more to this email it says second I had

156
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,759
no idea I even had this but I just found

157
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,478
almost a whole ounce stuffed back in a

158
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,759
mason jar

159
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,189
I had no weed before this I think it's

160
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,038
some dream machine I hope your 420 is

161
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:40,139
just as good as mine job bless and happy

162
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,598
belated birthday by the way dude that is

163
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,788
a great email you took a DAB that made

164
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:46,319
you think of me the timer went off that

165
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:48,209
was super funny so I'm glad you had that

166
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,800
experience for 4/20 I'm glad you had as

167
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,930
good of a 4/20 as I did

168
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
dude you found almost an ounce of good

169
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,769
weed how stoned were you when you hid

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,968
that from yourself you probably didn't

171
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,799
even hide it from yourself

172
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,810
you probably got super stoned and like

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,158
I'm gonna put this out to eat here then

174
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,538
he stashed it somewhere thinking it was

175
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:04,829
there for safekeeping but you were too

176
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,649
high you hid it from yourself on

177
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:10,228
accident good job bro also congrats on

178
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,788
finding that right on time for 4/20 I'm

179
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:13,680
not too familiar with the strange dream

180
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,509
machine but I hope I hope after being

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,728
hit away hidden away in that jar for so

182
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,800
long I hope that is beautifully cured so

183
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,628
he ends up with saying I hope your 4/20

184
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,560
is just as good dude my 4/20 it was

185
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,060
perfect there couldn't have done

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,728
anything different to make it any better

187
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,379
it was amazing it was a great time then

188
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:30,120

hope you're smoking some of that dream

196
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,359
machine right now while you're listening

197
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,560
to me all right I've got one more email

198
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,069
for this episode

199
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,168
this one goes like this hey Rasta Jeff I

200
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,089
was traveling to see my grandparents and

201
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,349
I had you and white bike riding shotgun

202
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,359
to keep me entertained

203
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,189
for almost the three hour trip I

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,259
listened to a couple of episodes in

205
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,329
which the topic of Tolerance came up in

206
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,379
conversation hey first off thanks for

207
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,000
listening to the show while you're

208
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,009
traveling that is really cool to know

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,500
that we are in the road on the road in

210
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,479
the car keeping you entertained also

211
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,459
tolerance came up he says I have limited

212
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,348
gross space but I smoked a fair amount

213
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,418
of flour and concentrate so I usually

214
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:20,639
try to grow the largest plant I can to

215
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,990
get the most out of it that is always

216
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,210
the idea you've got to maximize your

217
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,250
space you got to maximize your growth so

218
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,899
that makes a lot of sense he says it

219
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,240
seems like the effects of that strain

220
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:32,638
are reduced the longer I use that one

221
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,098
particular strain to the point that I

222
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,379
have to smoke a lot to get any sort of

223
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,668
euphoria from it yes I understand why

224
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,348
that's happening we'll talk about that

225
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:43,109
but let's finish the message it says if

226
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:45,478
I switch to another strain that euphoria

227
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,970
comes on strong and fast but that will

228
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,269
fade with prolonged use of that strain

229
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,280
until I switch to another and so on have

230
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:56,009
you yourself experienced this or heard

231
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,959
of other people experience this seems

232
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,819
like this would almost show some sort of

233
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,908
tolerance to the terpenes or other

234
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,519
chemical combinations aside from just an

235
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:09,149
increase in THC tolerance thoughts

236
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,339
signed the milkman milkman this is a

237
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,109
very common thing especially somebody

238
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,638
that smokes on my level somebody that

239
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,710
consumes the amount of product that I

240
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,050
consume this is something that I notice

241
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:21,418
absolutely I like to label this as

242
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,668
something back in the day I called it

243
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,978
strain lock you were locked out from

244
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:28,668
that strain I'm not sure the exact

245
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:31,258
scientific description or the medical

246
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:33,809
explanation in my opinion kind of what

247
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,629
you said those Terps are in your body

248
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,009
and you're used to it and your body says

249
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,729
I've got those I'm not even gonna get

250
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,069
high from it

251
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,899
think about people who are on any type

252
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,370
of prescription pill if it's a pain pill

253
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,389
if it's something for their stomach if

254
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,669
it's something for their mental health

255
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,169
the first few times I don't know how

256
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,000
long because I'm not I haven't chosen a

257
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:52,860
specific medicine but for a duration of

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,669
taking that medicine in the beginning

259
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,169
you get

260
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,519
weird effects from it because your body

261
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,559
isn't used to it you're getting the

262
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,909
desired effect and you're getting what

263
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,989
they call side effects I don't think

264
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:03,870
there's side effects those are also

265
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,730
effects it's unfair to label anything as

266
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,830
a side effect if you're getting it as an

267
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,509
effect that is also part of the ride I

268
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,680
don't think that that's a fair label but

269
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,909
we're gonna move forward and quit

270
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,429
rambling about that that is a whole

271
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,959
another podcast but today if I gave you

272
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,399
a prescription of something I don't even

273
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,540
know what I should prescribe you let's

274
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,459
say I'm gonna give you morphine you're

275
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,839
in the hospital terribly something went

276
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,100
wrong I'm sorry I just put you in this

277
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,230
scenario you're in the hospital

278
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,879
you're on morphine the first few times

279
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,740
you hit that morphine pump you're gonna

280
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,169
be so [ __ ] up it's gonna feel like the

281
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,360
craziest morphine trip ever but after a

282
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:35,729
few days that morphine drip it just all

283
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,289
it does is ease the pain because you've

284
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,909
gotten sort of immune to it your body

285
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:40,559
knows what to do with this new foreign

286
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,059
substance that you're introducing into

287
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,469
your system so you hit the little

288
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,969
morphine button you get a little dose of

289
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,129
morphine the first time your body goes

290
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,720
oh what is this new [ __ ] and your brain

291
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,669
goes never had this before

292
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
woohoo and you go on a really cool

293
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:53,250
morphine ride I don't know what it's

294
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,020
like I don't even want to think about

295
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,370
that but I'm sure it's amazing because

296
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,659
I've seen my buddy in the hospital

297
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,159
having an issue with the morphine pump

298
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,509
and it was his best [ __ ] friend he

299
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,939
needed it he wasn't abusing it he was in

300
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:04,049
a bad condition but after a while he'd

301
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,310
hit that morphine button and nothing

302
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,779
what happened like you all right yeah

303
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,339
all it does now is take away the pain

304
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,629
for the first few days he'd hit that

305
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,160
morphine button and it would be like

306
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:13,439
watching somebody just slump over and

307
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,149
get goofy and drool on themselves so my

308
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,370
point is when you start anything new

309
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:20,100
into your body you will get much more

310
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,889
increased reaction then you build up a

311
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,009
tolerance to anything now you're right

312
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:28,110
it's not just THC the THC in my opinion

313
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:31,559
is what sends you up think about this as

314
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,570
maybe let's say that let's describe

315
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,339
smoking as fireworks I know this is a

316
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,900
long shot to start with but think of it

317
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,690
this way we're smoking and we are a

318
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,129
firework the THC decides how high up

319
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,590
into the air you go

320
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,600
if you smoke a lot of THC you fly higher

321
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:49,080
you smoke a little bit of THC he only

322
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,080
goes so high in my opinion the terpenes

323
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,240
the flavonoids the Paley it's the esters

324
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,759
all the other compounds inside of that

325
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,310
smoke are going to decide what direction

326
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,649
your firework flies and also what color

327
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,089
that firework puts off and also how high

328
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,919
it gets up into the air before it

329
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,180
explodes that is kind of a weird

330
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,870
description but that's always the way

331
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,759
I've thought of it

332
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,350
when you smoke THC you're going up

333
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,879
you're just gonna go up it doesn't

334
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,620
matter you got to put some turps in

335
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,210
there to decide what direction you go do

336
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,860
you get paranoid do you get the munchies

337
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,320
do you get the giggles do you get

338
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,149
euphoria do you get relaxed do you feel

339
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,480
like you got a poop does your pain go

340
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,579
away

341
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,320
does your toe tingle do you get

342
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,930
cottonmouth all those are going to be

343
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,028
different things determined by the

344
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,229
esters the Paley 'its and the terpenoids

345
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:32,879
now the cottonmouth is probably because

346
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,350
you're smoking but all those different

347
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,389
effects all the different highs that

348
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,120
your mind tricks you with are going to

349
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,460
be from the Paley it's the esters and

350
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,080
mostly the terpenes so when you were

351
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,509
smoking the same strain for like however

352
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,100
many days a whole harvest 60 days until

353
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,809
you harvest the next crop you're

354
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,659
probably giving yourself what is called

355
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,549
strain lock in my opinion now you can

356
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,049
probably keep your pain or whatever

357
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,179
medical condition you're trying to keep

358
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,620
you can keep it at ease by continuing

359
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,269
with this strain but you're not going to

360
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,639
get the euphoria which you described

361
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,799
until you switch up and change those

362
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,379
terms change those pay leeet's change

363
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,509
those esters or change something so one

364
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,820
thing I may suggest and I don't know

365
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,200
your gross situation you said that you

366
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,390
try to grow the biggest plant you can

367
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,160
maybe try to grow two plants that are

368
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,080
half the size that way you've got two

369
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,549
different strains to smoke that way you

370
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,959
could smoke on this one for thirty days

371
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:23,490
and then when it gets old smoke on this

372
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,349
one or smoke this one for a week then

373
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,879
this one for a week however you feel

374
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,339
comfortable however you desire to

375
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,259
medicate yourself maybe you would go

376
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,600
with two smaller plants or perhaps for

377
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,549
smaller plants and smaller plants also

378
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
means less veg time so that may help you

379
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,599
out I don't know your grow environment

380
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,099
or your grow situation so maybe that's

381
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,230
not even an option I'm just making a

382
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,970
suggestion also if you're growing your

383
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,850
own medicine maybe you need to find a

384
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,589
friend who you can help in his garden or

385
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,360
her garden and you guys can become

386
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,040
friends and share grow information and

387
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,990
grow knowledge and kind of get your

388
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,299
grows on the same schedule and then when

389
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,680
you harvest maybe you could trade an

390
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,809
ounce for an ounce I don't know where

391
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,699
you are I don't know your situation that

392
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,619
is always a suggestion here in Colorado

393
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,180
it's not uncommon to say hey I just grew

394
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,679
way too much of this whatever strain

395
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,179
I've been smoking it just like you for

396
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,620
way too long a trade you an ounce for an

397
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,088
ounce and your friend will go let me see

398
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,950
the weed let me see the weed here to

399
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,300
take an ounce I got so much weed we got

400
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,770
so much herb laying around and Colorado

401
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,299
probably just take an ounce if you

402
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,720
wanted it I wouldn't even notice if you

403
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,549
need a quarter or something

404
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,540
pass it off don't even worry but I don't

405
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:24,938
know where you are I don't know your

406
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:26,649
situation but yes you are very accurate

407
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,328
you were experiencing something that I

408
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,250
have called strain lock this comes on

409
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:32,138
very quickly for me when I go shopping

410
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,600
at the dispensary I quite often

411
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,549
frustrate myself because I would see the

412
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,259
last time I went they had I'm just I'm

413
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,578
not trying to yeah let's see I'm just

414
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,810
gonna grab I've got most of my life

415
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:43,120
shopping experience right here in front

416
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:45,489
of me I got one gram of Mambo batter I

417
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,549
got one gram of Lucky Charms ambrosia I

418
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,829
got one gram of magic ambrosia one gram

419
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:53,109
of Tropicana cookies and one gram of

420
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:56,888
Luci jet there's also some fortissimo

421
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,990
some mai tai some star dog but you

422
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:00,430
notice I bought a large variety and

423
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,169
almost all of those things I only got

424
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,669
one gram of the Tropicana cookies there

425
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,588
is a four gram jar of it because it

426
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:07,838
smells and tastes amazing and I just

427
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,939
couldn't pass it up but when I shop I

428
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,920
buy this variety because I quickly

429
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:14,019
experience this strain lock which you

430
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,789
were talking about even on the level

431
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,709
that I consume these concentrates all

432
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,500
still I'll smoke to this whole gram of

433
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,088
Tropicana cookies today and I'll try to

434
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,500
smoke some of that tomorrow but I didn't

435
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,059
get a buzz off of that and so I'll

436
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,828
switch it up I'll take a dab of the Luci

437
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:28,299
jet and it'll blow my mind there's

438
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:30,429
because I switched it up so it happens

439
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,889
quite quickly to me and it still happens

440
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:35,528
with concentrates so when I shop for

441
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,299
concentrates I generally buy one gram of

442
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:39,220
several different things so that I can

443
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:41,169
enjoy it and stay buzzed for several

444
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,629
days now where that frustrates me is I

445
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,729
bought this Lucy jet and I haven't tried

446
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:47,289
it yet because I'm just gonna save this

447
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,659
one until I so I've got something fresh

448
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,219
to switch into I bet that when I open up

449
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,230
this package it's going to smell amazing

450
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,149
I'll take a couple of dabs of it and

451
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,649
I'll say [ __ ] why didn't I buy like four

452
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,120
or five of those and the way the

453
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,039
dispensaries work is when you go back

454
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,568
all that good [ __ ] is gone because the

455
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,009
smart people bought two or three or

456
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,409
three or four at a time when they were

457
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:07,300
there whatever that's how life goes

458
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:09,639
I'm staying medicated I'm happy with

459
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:11,679
what I'm smoking but to recap on this

460
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,720
email what you were experiencing is what

461
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,328
I call strain lock you're gonna have to

462
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,009
switch up to another strain and don't

463
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:20,109
think that you can fix this just by

464
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:22,058
upgrading to concentrates all the time

465
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,500
because what that will do you'll put

466
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:26,049
yourself in the same position with

467
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,240
concentrates I smoke so much concentrate

468
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,370
that sometimes I will spend most of the

469
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,928
day not medicating not even thinking

470
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,549
about medicating because I know it's not

471
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:34,959
going to do anything to me

472
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,729
I'll try to wait until the evening time

473
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,410
until right before podcast times that I

474
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,970
could actually take one of those quarter

475
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,529
gram half gram Debs and I'm talking

476
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,509
about and have it actually [ __ ] me up

477
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,029
and have some sort of a tremendous mark

478
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,259
on my day if not it's just smoking

479
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,600
through concentrates and I never even

480
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,129
notice any effect from it so what I

481
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,840
think you were experiencing is what I

482
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,580
call strain lock you're just gonna have

483
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,530
to switch it up or you're going to have

484
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,930
to consume less and who wants to do that

485
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,759
so switch it up seems to be the option

486
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,049
all right milkman I hope I answered your

487
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,819
question I want to thank you for the

488
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,109
great email I hope you had a great time

489
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,690
