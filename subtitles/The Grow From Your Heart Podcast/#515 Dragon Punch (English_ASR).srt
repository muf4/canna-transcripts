22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,000
trying to catch my breath from the

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,039
gigantic dabs of Sour Diesel BX to

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,869
full-spectrum extract that I just took

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,480
big shout out to my friends at green dot

26
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:00,179
labs I am really enjoying the Sour

27
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,788
Diesel BX to full-spectrum extract

28
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,069
diamonds this jar was ridiculous with

29
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,079
big chunky diamonds let's talk about the

30
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,899
cross here on the label this is a blend

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,000
of Sour Diesel and Sour Diesel cross to

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,520
headbanger so this is a B X which means

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
they were trying to recreate the Sour

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,199
Diesel this is a B x2 there is not a

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,090
Sour Diesel male available so they had

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
to introduce the head banger male they

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,810
bred the head banger mail to the Sour

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,609
Diesel then you find the appropriate

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,950
mail then you breathe that back to the

40
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,450
Sour Diesel that is a B X there's a lot

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,219
of work into that that is a whole

42
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,290
another podcast episode which I think I

43
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,019
have done let's stay focused for today

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,439
on the package of this Sour Diesel B x2

45
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,929
it is described as floral sweet and pine

46
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,408
which I find to be completely accurate

47
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,049
in most cases I do not enjoy the flavor

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,049
of Sour Diesel concentrates I don't

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,750
think that that sour diesel diesel funky

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,880
gas aroma translates well when it comes

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,560
to diamonds and sauce something is just

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,780
missing I don't think it comes out

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,820
properly the skunk part goes away it

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,879
turns into weird harsh chemicals it is

55
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,598
not my favorite in this case with the

56
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,239
Green Dot labs Sour Diesel B x2 most of

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,799
that weird chemically funkiness is gone

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,750
when you hit it when

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,240
you open the jar you immediately smell I

60
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,199
immediately smell the floral aroma which

61
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,480
they are talking about

62
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,219
then when the dabber hits the dab and

63
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,739
starts going into your face it gets that

64
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,780
floral sweet thing happening then on the

65
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,700
exhale that is where the pine kind of

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,099
coats my tongue it leaves the room like

67
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,049
floral and piney I really enjoy it it's

68
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,699
like a pine air freshener with a little

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,010
bit of perfume to it I think it's

70
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,899
delicious and I obviously am loving the

71
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,849
buzz on the back of the package it says

72
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,000

73
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,519

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
Gaming schemes come from so we've done

113
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,189
sonic boom last week let's do Dragon

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,010
Punch this week let's talk about Dragon

115
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:41,819
Punch Dragon Punch is a cross of East

116
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:43,769
Coast Panama chunk cross to Tk star dog

117
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,259
that plant did not have an official name

118
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,599
it had a name we discovered that another

119
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,000
breeder is already using that name he's

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,510
got a very popular line with that name

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,519
on it

122
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,289
so I have stopped referring to that name

123
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,689
altogether when it comes to this plant

124
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,780
so it is now known as East Coast Panama

125
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,370
Chunk cross to Tk start off those are

126
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,139
the genetics of the plant it doesn't

127
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,449
have a name that's what it is I know

128
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,569
what it is it is an awesome plan east

129
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:11,339
coast Panama chunk creates giant giant

130
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,980
buds they are monstrous and they have

131
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:17,310
this chocolaty funky earthy aroma to

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,580
them then the TK star dog is gassy and

133
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,379
funky and has a really nice few li funk

134
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,159
to it and grows really well so that was

135
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,659
a beautiful hybrid that plant created

136
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,150
gigantic plants that plant created

137
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,430
gigantic buds that plant created

138
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:34,709
beautiful colors it would create purples

139
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,180
and magentas and pinks and reds and if

140
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,129
you let it flower long enough the buds

141
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,350
would get this really dark dark color

142
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,659
the plants were super beautiful

143
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:46,710
that was east coast Panama Chunk cross

144
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,960
to Tk star dog then I took my prized a

145
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,129
rise male who is known as King Solomon

146
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,859
I'm sure if you listen to this podcast

147
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:55,199
you've heard me talk about King Solomon

148
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,750
King Solomon is a very select arise male

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,519
arise is a golden goat to Daybreaker

150
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,490
hybrid golden goat has that tropical

151
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,079
sweet sativa dominant characteristics

152
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,449
it's got real thin leaves it tastes

153
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,370
really tropical and it grows in about

154
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,860
nine weeks so it is a very beautiful

155
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,949
plant to work with I pollinated that

156
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,439
with a Daybreaker male Daybreaker is an

157
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,500
indica dominant hybrid it is a cross of

158
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:22,589
Kim D and Joseph og so you've got that

159
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,660
Kim D rotten funk that fresh tennis ball

160
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,939
burnt rubber kind of a smell cross to

161
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,740
the Joseph Bo G which is really funky

162
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,810
really fuelie it's got a little bit of a

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,850
feet aroma to it so when you cross the

164
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,668
golden goat and the Daybreaker you get a

165
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,890
sweet tropical funky nasty sort of a

166
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,719
thing and a rise seems to grow with

167
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,610
hyper vigour that plant grows really

168
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,759
quickly so that male that I select

169
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,500
did passes on that hyper vigor trait all

170
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,750
of his offspring grow really quickly

171
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,728
they grow really rapidly with a lot of

172
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,918
branching so you can fetch them for

173
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:55,228
about a week less than many other plants

174
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,968
in many situations I have also

175
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:59,699
discovered that most of the things I

176
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:02,459
pollinate with King Solomon become very

177
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,370
potent all of his progeny are highly

178
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,529
potent in lab tests I have seen many of

179
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,990
his offspring test in the high 20s and

180
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:12,598
several of them test in the low 30s I've

181
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,759
gotten a rise female that tests at

182
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,610
thirty five point eight four percent THC

183
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,620
a at steep hill labs that is one of my

184
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,900
favorite plants to work with that shows

185
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,028
the potential of that male plant which I

186
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:27,179
have selected so I have crossed that

187
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:29,310
male arise plant to the female east

188
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,560
coast Panama chunk which was crossed to

189
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,028
the TK star dog if you're trying to

190
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,740
write down the name of that plant I

191
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:37,620
would put a parenthesis and I would

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,750
write EC PC that's east coast Panama

193
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,319
chunk then I would put an X and that is

194
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,389
crossed to Tk SD which is T case star

195
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,430
dog which is the infamous triangle cush

196
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,009
crossed to the star dog so in

197
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,800
parentheses you would have EC PC and

198
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,060
then a space and then an X and then TK

199
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
SD and then you would close your

200
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,418
parentheses up there then you would

201
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,699
write another X and then you would write

202
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,769
arise because the female plant was the

203
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,110
east coast Panama trunk crossed the TK

204
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:06,180
star dog that's all one cross that goes

205
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,379
in parentheses then you put an X the

206
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,978
male that I introduced into that

207
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,990
collaboration there was the arize so now

208
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:15,300
knowing that pedigree knowing that all

209
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,129
star lineup of genetics we know what to

210
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,650
expect a little bit from this cross

211
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,599
we've got east coast Panama chunk which

212
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:23,399
is known for making gigantic buds that

213
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,408
are kind of chocolatey they have sort of

214
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,209
a hashey sort of a smell then we've got

215
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:29,098
the TK star dog which is known for that

216
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,709
skunky funky aroma and that vigorous

217
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,990
growth then we've got a rise which comes

218
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:36,240
from Kim D and Joseph og so we've got

219
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,278
more potential for even more dirty funky

220
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,139
aromas then we've got that golden goat

221
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,698
in there to kind of give it that sativa

222
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,828
edge so you can get that super

223
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:46,259
head-ripping hi this is a really

224
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,899
interesting and a really fun hybrid and

225
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,669
when I grew it out I got mostly what I

226
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,049
was expecting we will talk about some of

227
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,909
the phenotypes here a little bit later

228
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,229
in the show let's talk about the

229
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,929
flavours and aroma

230
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,639
they come from the Dragon Punch plant my

231
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:02,489
favorite aromas that come from this

232
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,889
plant are sort of a chocolatey earthy

233
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,320
sort of a coffee sort of a burnt rubber

234
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,029
sort of a smell it is really funky and I

235
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,490
really enjoy it it's kind of dark

236
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,259
chocolaty kind of hashey and it's got a

237
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,389
little bit of a hint of armpits to it

238
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,460
that may sound completely disgusting but

239
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,139
when it comes to cannabis I think some

240
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,000
of those words are the best things you

241
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,069
can hear in a strain description it's

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,320
got funky it's got chocolate it's got

243
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,840
armpits to it there are a lot of really

244
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,580
unique aromas and flavors that come from

245
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,860
this plant it is sort of like you took

246
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,690
dark chocolate and maybe some coffee and

247
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,210
then put a little bit of jet fuel inside

248
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,160
of that cup and it is deliciously funky

249
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,710
I keep saying funky because there's just

250
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,839
a weird funk to the Dragon Punch and I

251
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,730
really love it I really believe that

252
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,580
that East Coast Panama chunk put a

253
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,620
really nice chocolatey earthy sort of a

254
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,530
flavor and aroma into this cross because

255
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,299
I've also crossed the arize to the star

256
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,429
dog and I don't get any of that coffee

257
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,439
flavor from that cross that one goes

258
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,179
more gas and berries when you put the

259
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,100
East Coast Panama chunk in there it

260
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,379
really gave it like an earthy savory

261
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,970
sort of a tone sort of uh I keep saying

262
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,009
chocolate but that's probably the best

263
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,009
description I've got chocolate real dark

264
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:13,620
chocolate sort of earthy burnt coffee I

265
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:15,779
really love that aroma in the back end

266
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,779
of my cannabis so that is basically the

267
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,179
flavor chocolatey funky earthy hashey a

268
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,889
hint of feet and maybe hints of fuel in

269
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,500
some of the phenotypes now let's talk

270
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:28,439
about the buzz what is it like when you

271
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,600
smoke dragon punch there is a reason why

272
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,880
I called it dragon punch it is sort of

273
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,740
like getting punched right in the face

274
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,570
when you hit dragon punch a couple of

275
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,180
times you kind of just want to chill out

276
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,400
it feels like your body is super stoned

277
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,799
like your body just sucks into the couch

278
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,990
it's like I might be stuck here for a

279
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,269
minute but also your brain starts going

280
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,009
so fast that you really wish you could

281
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:52,139
get up and do some [ __ ] but you're just

282
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:54,059
like no I'm probably just gonna sit here

283
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,100
if you've got a guitar in your hand or

284
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,689
if you've got a PlayStation or an Xbox

285
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,460
controller in your hand you're probably

286
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,380
in the [ __ ] zone if you're a

287
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,210
songwriter if you're an artist if you're

288
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,159
a musician or something like that this

289
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,290
is the perfect kind of herb that I'm a

290
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,179
podcaster I'm a musician I do all kinds

291
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:10,559
of random creativity sort of thing

292
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,929
this is the kind of stuff that when I

293
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,549
smoke it I just want to sit here and be

294
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,169
creative I don't want to be around other

295
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,089
people I don't need any other sort of

296
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,399
inputs or anything I just want to

297
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,590
entertain myself my creativity just

298
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,659
starts going crazy when I smoke the

299
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,940
Dragon Punch so it makes my body just

300
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:29,159
done I just want to sit here and chill

301
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,170
out but my brain is like okay let's do

302
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,779
all of the things so it's really nice

303
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,759
creative herb for me I think it works

304
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,740
great to play the guitar maybe play some

305
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,720
video games maybe write some stuff down

306
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,909
for a podcast and get a creative flow

307
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,639
going I think it's really good herb for

308
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:47,669
my brain I also find that it's super

309
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,009
good for lower back pain I'm a six foot

310
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,839
five guy I try not to complain too much

311
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,250
about my body aches and pains coz we're

312
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,710
all humans we all got aches and pains

313
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,679
and all that [ __ ] but sometimes my

314
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,660
lower back [ __ ] sucks I don't talk

315
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,370
about it a lot nobody cares all I got to

316
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,199
do is take a dab of Dragon Punch and

317
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,539
guess what no more lower back pain it

318
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,370
makes it just go away and one thing that

319
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,929
I almost forgot to mention I noticed

320
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,879
that when I smoked Dragon Punch if I

321
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,739
smoked it before bedtime to ease that

322
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,860
back pain to kind of show myself out I

323
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,539
have amazing dreams I already have

324
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,399
pretty intense dreams I can kind of

325
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,379
control my dreams a little bit but I

326
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,539
feel when I smoke that Dragon Punch I've

327
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,090
got a lot more control of my dreams and

328
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,219
they are very intense I feel like if I

329
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,450
try to play around too much in my dreams

330
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,860
like if I'm doing something and I

331
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,720
realize oh bro you're dreaming and

332
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,669
you've got control of this sometimes I

333
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,920
can like manipulate the dreams but if I

334
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:39,899
do too much I'll wake myself up I feel

335
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,639
like when I smoke Dragon Punch I can

336
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,740
really dance around in that dream realm

337
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,449
and I don't wake myself up as easily and

338
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,220
snap myself out or whatever crazy

339
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,680
situation I've got myself into in

340
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,660
dreamland so it gives me incredible

341
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,779
dreams it helps to relieve the pain and

342
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,789
it just makes me super creative my goal

343
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,620
when I bred this plant was to get some

344
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:00,870
of that chocolate flavor and some of

345
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,879
those purple and magenta colors into

346
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,549
that a rise cross but also bring that a

347
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,830
rise potency into the cross bring that a

348
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:10,559
rise vigour into the cross the East

349
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,530
Coast Panama chunk TK star dog plant was

350
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,149
already a crazy vigorous grower but

351
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,009
sometimes it didn't make the biggest

352
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,049
chunk es buds if the room was not

353
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:21,419
perfect it was kind of a finicky picky

354
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,079
plant I know that King Solomon puts

355
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,089
crazy vigor into plants

356
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,820
I know it puts crazy potency into plants

357
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,430
so my idea was to cross the King Solomon

358
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,770
to the east coast Panama chunk T case

359
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:35,259
star dog cross to kind of increase the

360
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,120
bigger and fix that finicky this that

361
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,620
plant originally had we would grow the

362
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,330
[ __ ] out of most of the plants in the

363
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,580
grow and this one would be like yeah I'm

364
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,960
cool but I could have done better and I

365
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,700
knew there was more potential in that

366
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,340
plant but in a commercial environment

367
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,290
you cannot adjust the entire room for

368
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,580
one plant if seven out of ten plants are

369
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,709
thriving and three of them are kind of

370
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,450
going and you leave it just like it is

371
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,340
so that seventy percent of your room is

372
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,259
killing it and you would just don't run

373
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,420
those three next time you run those in a

374
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,129
different room and fix that but I knew I

375
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,339
could fix it so I bred it to the arize

376
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:08,679
and it came out very close to what I was

377
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,420
hoping for the only thing I see from

378
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,519
this cross that I was really not hoping

379
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:15,849
for I kind of hope didn't happen is some

380
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,879
of the plants are extremely tall there

381
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,590
are very very tall phenotypes there is a

382
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,330
phenotype that I call the tall stretchy

383
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,730
girl it looks like you're growing a

384
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,580
[ __ ] fishing pole it will make one

385
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,170
giant 6-foot tall Cola right up the

386
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,330
middle and it doesn't give you a lot of

387
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,610
side branching that's a really cool

388
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,650
[ __ ] trait that is also a serious

389
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,330
pain in the ass trait for a plant if

390
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,740
you're growing in an indoor tent and

391
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,700
you've got three or four of these in a

392
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,500
room and you're thinking you're gonna

393
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,960
get some 5 foot tall plants with some

394
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,850
branching maybe not because sometimes

395
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,129
this one phenotype just doesn't make

396
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,629
much branching and it shoots one six

397
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,370
foot tall Cola right out of the middle

398
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,990
of the plant so if you're in a tent

399
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,120
you're [ __ ] screwed because those

400
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,529
tents are only six feet tall maybe seven

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,539
feet tall you're touching the light

402
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,789
you've got to do some manipulation that

403
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:03,969
is the downside to this plant keep in

404
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:06,159
mind that is only one phenotype and also

405
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,930
outdoors in the right environment that

406
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,819
plant would be [ __ ] awesome

407
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,739
so as an honest and open breeder who

408
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,090
likes to have a very open conversation

409
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,340
with my friends and the people who buy

410
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,930
my seeds and my supporters I'm going to

411
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,030
tell you there is a phenotype in this

412
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:21,789
pack of seeds that is a real [ __ ] it

413
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,919
gets way too tall but if you're growing

414
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:26,079
outdoors run a tall greenhouse that

415
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,849
thing could be [ __ ] the super cash

416
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,280
crop er for you because there's not much

417
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,840
trimming it just makes giant fan leaves

418
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,730
it doesn't make a lot of little sugar

419
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,139
leaf so you just clip off those giant

420
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,649
fan leaves and you've got six foot long

421
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,629
baseball bat colas

422
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,340
they look super good on social media

423
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,649
they're really good advertising for you

424
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,090
and for myself it'll work beautifully if

425
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,159
that's what you're trying to do but be

426
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,350
prepared if you've got a phenotype that

427
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,419
starts getting really tall on you really

428
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,220
quickly most people assume that one's

429
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,779
going to be a male I've assumed that

430
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,340
when most plants take off I go that's

431
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,779
gonna be my boy and I just start paying

432
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,790
attention and I know he's probably the

433
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,889
first to go you may not have that you

434
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:03,379
may have the fishing-pole phenotype that

435
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:05,149
gets really big so as a reliable breeder

436
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,009
who tries to be honest and open I'm

437
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,809
going to tell you that one may be

438
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,970
problematic for a lot of people and

439
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:13,489
honest I did not predict foresee

440
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,410
anticipate or expect that plant from my

441
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,450
breeding project I don't know where that

442
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:19,399
comes from I don't know which plants

443
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,379
make that happen in this cross I'm

444
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,120
assuming it's something in the East

445
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,919
Coast Panama chunk because I've played

446
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,600
with all of the other plants before in

447
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,610
different combinations and I've never

448
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,769
gotten this so there is an East Coast

449
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,620
Panama chunk trait that is making just

450
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:35,659
one six foot tall giant donkey dick

451
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,730
baseball bat but in there if you get

452
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:39,500
that one send me pictures let me know

453
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,389
what you think if it works for you or if

454
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,710
it doesn't now you know what to expect

455
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,269
I've just got to admit that it's there

456
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,190
as a breeder I didn't know that was

457
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,230
coming it was kind of a big surprise

458
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,490
also a very neat surprise to go what's

459
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,590
with this one it's not making much

460
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,940
branching it just made the plant was

461
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,740
like three feet tall and I had like four

462
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,600
or five little tiny side branches off of

463
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,100
it and then I took two of them off to

464
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,529
make clones and then that [ __ ] took

465
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,810
off six feet tall is ridiculous all

466
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,879
right I'm off on a rant on that but the

467
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:07,339
downside to this cross is you will get

468
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,380
tall plants the upside to this crosses

469
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,079
for outdoor growing you may get some

470
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,240
gigantic [ __ ] plants they will be

471
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,789
very colorful plants most of these

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,250
phenotypes produce really dark green

473
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,960
leaves you find really beautiful fall

474
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,150
colors toward the end of flower I've

475
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,309
seen reds and pinks and magentas and

476
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,830
oranges and golds the leaves look like

477
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,559
flames and fire with purple on the tips

478
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,480
these plants make gorgeous gorgeous

479
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,819
colors at the end of the flowering phase

480
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,910
also I have noticed that if you lower

481
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:40,639
the pH and also get it kind of cold you

482
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,710
will see a lot of beautiful beautiful

483
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,259
colors now let's talk a little bit about

484
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,240
feeding dragon punch dragon punch makes

485
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:49,579
giant buds dragon punch is a fast

486
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,359
growing plant dragon punch is going to

487
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,058
eat

488
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,579
of nutrients she will also like an

489
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:57,230
excessive amount of calmac I've noticed

490
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,439
that some of the broader leaved

491
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,529
phenotypes like a lot of cal-mag she

492
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,690
also prefers lower pH if you can get the

493
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:07,369
pH a little bit lower than most plants I

494
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,320
feel like the Dragon Punch will

495
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,750
appreciate life a little bit better and

496
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,769
she will also make those beautiful fall

497
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,009
colors

498
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,500
she is very resistant to all temperature

499
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:21,079
swings from what I have noticed she does

500
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,400
well in hot she does well in cold she'll

501
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,159
do wonderfully in a dialed-in

502
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,470
environment she also responds very well

503
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,570
to kelp products I feel like some kelp a

504
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,339
product something like liquid karma or

505
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:33,409
something in that realm will bring out

506
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:35,289
that stank and that flavor and aroma

507
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,960
also helps bring out those beautiful

508
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:41,058
fall colors I generally recommend that

509
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,860
you lollipop and pop and twist and

510
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:45,440
trellis all of the plants that I breed I

511
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,509
have noticed that sometimes the Dragon

512
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,700
Punch does not respond well to popping

513
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:52,190
and twisting some of the phenotypes will

514
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,110
create really purple stems those plants

515
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,450
do not like to be twisted they do not

516
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,548
like the popping that may be a nutrient

517
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,590
deficiency I think it is genetic because

518
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:02,660
I've seen it in several phenotypes we've

519
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:04,759
tried to correct it it stays purple I

520
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,679
think it is a genetic expression those

521
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,179
purple stems do not want to be popped

522
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,519
and twisted they're brittle they're

523
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,410
finicky they're not into it sometimes

524
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,990
this plant does not react well to

525
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,179
trellising bat finicky woody type of

526
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,890
stem sometimes makes them want to break

527
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,380
when you're trying to trellis it down I

528
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,720
have noticed if you feed them well in

529
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,850
veg and you keep them young and lush

530
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,339
they don't get as woody and you can

531
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:30,230
manipulate and Bend and twist them when

532
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,730
you put them into flower and they start

533
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,558
freaking out a little bit making that

534
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,480
transition they will get a little bit

535
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,859
stiff and woody on you they get a little

536
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,319
bit stubborn for bending and

537
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:40,969
manipulating at this time if you can get

538
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,230
all of your training all your popping

539
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,929
all of your twisting all of your

540
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,640
trellising down before all of the plants

541
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,559
get into that flowering phase and begin

542
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,870
to get woody the plants will be happy

543
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,879
and they will continue to grow but you

544
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,558
will notice that later in flower those

545
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,419
plants will start to get purple and

546
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,069
they'll start to get woody don't bend

547
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,020
them don't treat them too roughly

548
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:02,418
because some of those phenotypes will

549
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,279
get a little bit delicate now this plant

550
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,410
is one of my more

551
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,420
challenging plants to grow this may not

552
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,640
be the best plant for beginners this is

553
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,560
more of an experienced grower plant it

554
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,290
is not the easiest to grow because of

555
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,289
that non flexible bending and working

556
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:19,879
type of thing and it also takes nine to

557
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,829
ten weeks to flower most of my other

558
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,050
stuff is done by nine this one's going

559
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:26,720
to take that extra week I recommend nine

560
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:29,599
or ten some phenotypes will want eleven

561
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,569
weeks but like I mentioned earlier we

562
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,129
are going to get gigantic buds sometimes

563
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:37,099
you're going to seize four to six foot

564
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,840
long colas off of these plants but it is

565
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:41,209
kind of a pain in the ass for a new

566
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,099
grower to manage that Monstress of a

567
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,140
plant I recommend an experienced grower

568
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:46,699
to grow these plants don't be afraid I

569
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,560
just think that it takes a little bit of

570
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,940
extra work it's going to need more

571
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,619
supports you're going to have to pay

572
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,059
more attention it's going to take a

573
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,669
little bit longer which gives you more

574
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:58,519
opportunity for problems so this is not

575
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,950
a beginner plant but like anything that

576
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:03,139
requires hard work the rewards are very

577
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,120
worth it those phenotypes that are more

578
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,400
challenging to grow those phenotypes

579
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,309
which take longer to flower are usually

580
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,320
generally more extremely potent if

581
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,480
you've got that 11 weaker when you smoke

582
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,399
that thing you are going to go silly

583
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,900
your eyes are gonna go what the [ __ ]

584
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,130
just happened you're gonna sit down in

585
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,140
the chair and wonder if you're melting

586
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,060
but then your brain is gonna fly to the

587
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,100
moon and back without you if you get

588
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,809
those eleven weak phenotypes the high

589
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:29,329
will rip your head off and it is

590
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,819
impressive so now let's kind of talk

591
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,919
about some of the phenotypes which I

592
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:37,009
have hinted at there is the beautiful

593
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,710
East Coast Panama chunk to TK star dog

594
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,450
dominant phenotype which is beautiful

595
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,850
it's real chocolatey it's got that

596
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,710
beautiful bright green color that comes

597
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:47,449
from the star dog it's got those bright

598
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,819
orange pistols that comes from the star

599
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,230
dog and then it just smells funky and

600
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,789
then it's got kind of a little bit of a

601
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,769
fluffy look to the butts they aren't as

602
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:57,139
tight as some of the other phenotypes if

603
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,329
you've got the fluffier phenotype that

604
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,450
is probably coming from the east coast

605
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:05,449
Panama chunk then there is the 50/50

606
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,880
phenotype which looks just like the TK

607
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,920
star dog just like the arize it's got a

608
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,990
little bit of golden gut resemblance to

609
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,880
it it's got a sweet smell to it it's got

610
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,130
a chocolatey smell to it and it's got a

611
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,050
dirty funk to it it grows beautifully

612
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,640
it's got nice tight buds

613
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,710
this one makes decent amounts of

614
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,440
branching it's not real ridiculous like

615
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,140
the East Coast Panama chunk then I often

616
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,299
see basically an arise phenotype come

617
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,220
out of this it looks just like a rise

618
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,879
number four it looks just like King

619
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,430
Solomon

620
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,740
it looks very simply smells very simply

621
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,769
just like a rise then there is the one

622
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,990
that I call the leggy girl or the tall

623
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,240
girl or the [ __ ] fishing pole this

624
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,049
one just takes off I believe you can see

625
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,789
it in veg it creates one long skinny

626
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,829
branch with just a few side branches

627
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,569
coming off sometimes it'll make really

628
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,159
long side branches that come off if you

629
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:57,019
chop those off that'll just make one

630
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,779
giant [ __ ] Cola draw up that whole

631
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,819
branch it's ridiculous that phenotype I

632
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:03,740
talked about it earlier it's fun it's

633
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:05,329
also a pain in the ass if you think

634
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,759
you've got that one and you're an indoor

635
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:09,289
in an indoor environment flower early

636
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,490
and see what you've got you may have

637
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:13,430
something [ __ ] amazing

638
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,440
there is another phenotype which scared

639
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,820
some of my test growers they all thought

640
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,460
that they had a problem they could not

641
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:22,609
identify there is a phenotype which will

642
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,910
make very droopy leaves that comes from

643
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:28,729
the Daybreaker for some reason that

644
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,680
Daybreaker makes gigantic leaves and no

645
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,329
matter how much you feed it that [ __ ]

646
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,279
does not want to lift those leaves up

647
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,750
they just stay a little bit droopy it

648
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,420
looks like it's not dying it just looks

649
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,960
lazy most growers would say it needs

650
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,000
water

651
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,789
but you water the plant and it doesn't

652
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,109
go up those leaves are so big but I

653
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,670
think the plant just can't even support

654
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:47,959
them they're just like nah this oh

655
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,460
you're going three-quarters of the way

656
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,009
up that's all you get out of me bro I

657
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,350
think that is a Daybreaker trait I don't

658
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:56,359
see any problem with those plants if

659
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,309
you've got giant leaves that are kind of

660
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,299
dark green getting a little bit purple

661
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,309
up the middle of them

662
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,960
that is a Daybreaker trait if they are

663
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,970
drooping that is a trait from the

664
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,279
Daybreaker don't worry I don't think

665
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,890
that is a problem that plant is going to

666
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,660
be very indica dominant in most cases

667
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,360
that one makes you want to sit on your

668
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,420
ass all day I've noticed that one gives

669
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:20,209
me dragon red eyes also that will make

670
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,940
your eyes super red that one is mostly

671
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,799
dominated by the Daybreaker I think that

672
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,049
one is honestly mostly dominated by the

673
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,879
Joseph og it could have some of that

674
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,159
east coast Panama junk because it gets

675
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,060
that funky chocolate flavor and aroma to

676
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,710
it also

677
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:35,389
now there is one more phenotype I know

678
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,769
I've listed a bunch of phenotypes but

679
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,170
I've got to be honest with you there is

680
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:41,240
variation in this line some people love

681
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,490
that some people do not there is a

682
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,549
phenotype that makes taco leaves that is

683
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,289
very golden goat dominant golden goat

684
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,690
will get pissed off and make taco leaves

685
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:52,879
late in flower so if you see some big

686
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,529
chunky buds that are a little bit Fox

687
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,450
tailee let's start making a little bit

688
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,129
of taco leaf maybe you get some pointy

689
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,990
tips on the buds out of there maybe a

690
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,030
little bit thinner leaf that is the one

691
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,640
that I call the taco leaf phenotype that

692
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:06,200
is very golden goat dominant you're

693
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,120
seeing a lot of golden goat rates from

694
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,100
that plant but still a wonderful plant

695
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,349
it will finish beautifully but it is

696
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:14,209
going to taco almost no matter what you

697
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,609
do the leaves are gonna we call it taco

698
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,620
leaf or canoeing but they also frost up

699
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:21,829
and get covered in resin so it looks

700
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:23,779
like [ __ ] but it is super potent bud

701
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:25,789
most of those phenotypes like I've said

702
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:28,369
before are going to finish in about nine

703
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:29,839
to ten weeks you will find outliers that

704
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,849
will take 11 weeks there are also

705
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,250
outliers that will take a little bit

706
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:36,409
longer if you are in the right location

707
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,660
many of these phenotypes will be amazing

708
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,580
plants for outdoor cultivation you will

709
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,290
get huge harvests if you take care of

710
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,730
these plants properly if you're in a

711
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,710
greenhouse you should have a good

712
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,660
outcome if you manage the plants

713
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,970
properly this plant will work very well

714
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,470
indoors if you are good at managing your

715
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,670
height and if you know what to expect

716
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,860
you've got to find the appropriate

717
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,090
phenotype for yourself don't be afraid

718
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,209
because I've talked about all these

719
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:02,119
large tall plants I run dragon punch

720
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,920
from seed in a 5 by 5 grow tent that is

721
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,109
my test area and I'm able to get

722
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,160
beautiful crops from that plant in a 5

723
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:08,750
by 5 grow tent

724
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,190
you just have to flower early you have

725
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,809
to understand how to manipulate the

726
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,059
plants and keep them short don't be

727
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,950
intimidated by tall long flowering

728
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,480
plants it may be a fun experiment for

729
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,980
some of you really experienced growers

730
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,029
who've just been focused on eight or

731
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,769
nine week strains

732
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,450
