this one I was told that people are

00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,459
writing down [ __ ] that I say that kind

72
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,500
of scares me oh wow yeah I was at a grow

73
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,959
store I was at Hydro indoor growing

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,639
supplies and I was just there to pick up

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,959
a couple of small random items and a

76
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,639
lady at the counter turned around and

77
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,560
she said Jeff I know you know the answer

78
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,958
and she made me come over and shop for

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,539
her a little bit and honestly the

80
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,539
solution that I gave her I learned from

81
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,939
our good friend Jesse uh what what was

82
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,318

00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,959
out it wasn't a problem she just wanted

84
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,359
to know which uh which bat guano to use

119
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,878
the line of products yeah it's nothing

120
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,279
wrong with it it's just not a big seller

121
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,859
for us it's a small shop also you can't

122
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,539
carry every single line in there we uh

123
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,459
we replaced it with some Botanical

124
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,438
products and we already sold out of the

125
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,299
stuff we stocked in today so I recommend

126
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,798
Botanica strongly to everybody that I

127
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,840
teach how to grow so that could have

128
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,698
some small factor we're going to carry

129
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,579

134
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500

135
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,839

one guy yeah hopefully you got to

186
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,620
harvest everything hopefully you didn't

187
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,299
get that frost on it that one night

188
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,340
uh it's coming up guys if you haven't

189
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,900
cut down yet you're a week or two away

190
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,819
maybe three or four weeks at the most

191
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,799
right yeah either that or you're

192
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,538
prepared for the Long Haul yeah you got

193
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,680
yeah you've got a greenhouse covered and

194
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,360
you've got a heater out there so if

195
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,160
you're just out in the backyard it's

196
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,080
really time to get your [ __ ] together

197
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,460
uh it's time to flush flushing is

198
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,719
important even if you're good this is

199
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,399
something that I've always wanted to

200
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,259
touch on on the show let's talk for a

201
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,418
we'll give it however much time this

202
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,160
takes we'll talk about flushing very

203
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,779
important yeah flushing as you're

204
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,039
feeding all of your cannabis plants you

205
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,079
were pouring even if you're using

206
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,240
Organics you're pouring stuff into the

207
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,418
root Zone that is staying in the soil

208
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,160
and your plants are feeding off of that

209
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:51,538
uh you don't want to smoke whatever

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,699
you're feeding your plants you don't

211
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,560
want that taste in your buds at the end

212
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,360
you don't want nitrogen you don't want

213
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,079
phosphorus you don't want potassium in

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,120
your buds tasty oh yeah yeah so the

215
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,740
plant actually takes up nutrients

216
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
it puts the nutrients where they want

217
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,519
and then yes your plants do spit out the

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
excess nutrients through the roots again

219
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,240
it basically shits them right out I'm

220
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,580
keeping this real simple what we need to

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
do now is flush the toilet we need to

222
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,719
get that poop soil out of there we just

223
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,339
want clean dirt for sure and if you're

224
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
recycling your dirt this is a good point

225
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,758
this is where you actually start

226
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,680
recycling your dirt is that the flush of

227
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,060
an indoor plant so this works for the

228
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,220
outdoor we want to do this to every

229
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,699
cannabis plant you ever grow before you

230
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,860
harvest it uh 10 to 14 days before you

231
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,080
cut down that plant

232
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,360
water the [ __ ] out of the plant water it

233
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,839
as much as you can and from then on out

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,960
only give it clean water just clean uh

235
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,418
PhD if you can but this is the end so

236
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,799
just give it a lot of Clean Water a

237
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,318
water in real well go ahead I'll let you

238
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,478
jump in on a container plants so it's a

239
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,800
20 gallon container I'll give it 20

240
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,139
gallons of water

241
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,360
and that's I I want to see you know

242
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,240
pretty much you'll have

243
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,220
I don't know from 17 gallons of water

244
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,098
come out probably yeah you know run off

245
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,860
that's I drag a seven gallon pot to an

246
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:13,139
area where I have a drain and I will

247
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,259
pour about 15 gallons of water through a

248
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,240
center gallon pot and repeat it you know

249
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,800
this is yeah just keep pouring water you

250
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,418
get get however much water you can fill

251
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,098
that pot with pour it in there let it

252
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,719
drain through it'll pour out go back in

253
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,399
a couple of minutes pour another pitcher

254
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,960
or a bucket or whatever you're using

255
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,939
pour more water in there

256
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,918
if you can set the hose in your plants

257
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,679
on your pot plants water them until

258
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,179
you're afraid that it's over watered up

259
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,500
you're not too worried about killing

260
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,179
them at this point it is the end of the

261
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,860
season you won't over water them they're

262
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,478
Outdoors that water will go somewhere

263
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,800
you want to get all that nutrients off

264
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,778
there the indoor container plants

265
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,759
Jessie's perfect on that just water that

266
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,080
pot as much as you can if you have to

267
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,278
it's kind of hard to get a plant

268
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,080
somewhere if you're working a seven

269
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:53,580
gallon pot you need to get it kind of up

270
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,040
off the ground so it'll drain properly

271
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,200
yeah a shop vac is your best friend

272
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,539
there you go if you don't have adequate

273
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,860
kind of where I was headed or uh set

274
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,179
that foot a lot of you guys are grown in

275
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,860
the basement and you got a dedicated

276
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,719
bathroom set that sucker in the shower

277
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,700
put it up on two cinder blocks under the

278
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,200
pot so that it doesn't go anywhere and

279
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
that creates a lot of drainage space

280
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,320
that water will pour right out of those

281
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,240
bottom holes of the pot if you've got a

282
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,620
three gallon pot set that put a couple

283
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,778
of cinder blocks in your garage maybe

284
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,459
where you can get some water going or if

285
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:21,838
you've got a cool backyard where your

286
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,159
stash is kind of hidden you don't want

287
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,480
to don't show your pot plants to your

288
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,879
neighbors and be real careful about

289
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,920
bringing bugs in but this is the end you

290
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,259
got to flush them real good always 14

291
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,939
it's 10 to 14 days with nothing but

292
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,338
water if you had any nutrient burn

293
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,260
problems get in there maybe a week

294
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,140
before you can I don't think you can

295
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,278
over flush

296
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,419
yeah no the only thing you're going to

297
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,919
do is kill it I mean it's going to run

298
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,360
out it's going to be starve to death you

299
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,159
drown the roots because you're giving it

300
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,019
you know 15 Gallons every day right

301
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,019
that's uh you know this is

302
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,759
um flushing will help your plants burn

303
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,339
better

304
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,679
uh they'll dry and cure better they'll

305
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,720
smoke they'll smoke better they'll taste

306
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,759
better they'll smell better have you

307
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,019
ever smoked pot that uh it almost tastes

308
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,539
like you just stuck your tongue in a

309
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,580
light socket like it leaves that burnt

310
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,799
[ __ ] on your tongue that probably had

311
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,080
not been flushed I feel like I can name

312
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,139
the brand of nutrients Sometimes some uh

313
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,639
I've I can taste worm castings a lot of

314
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,139
times in people's weed I can taste

315
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,819
Advanced Nutrients honestly if you

316
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,919
overdo a couple of things in botanic

317
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,860
hair I can taste it if you overdo it and

318
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,599
don't flush it Lucas formula always has

319
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,360
its own

320
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,480
um that's you know I think GH always has

321
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,580
a um it brings out the limonene smell I

322
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,060
think a candy lemony lemon head candy

323
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,320
yeah smell when you use GH I think so so

324
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,539
if you've got something that you want

325
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,579
that is a lemon strain and you want to

326
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,379
bring out that lemon uh feed it the

327
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,359
General Hydroponics also I don't say

328
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,220
this a lot this is kind of a secretive

329
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,480
thing that a lot of us know that one of

330
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,399
those things that you have to like read

331
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,200
a lot to learn stressing the plant with

332
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,940
light strap gas and heat will bring out

333
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
limonene so if you're trying to Lemon up

334
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,360
your lemon strains drop that light a

335
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,979
little bit too close around week six of

336
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,440
ripening and you'll bring out the

337
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,000
limonene terpenoid I've heard you say

338
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,779
that that'll also stretch your plants a

339
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
little bit so you're going to have to

340
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:10,439
adjust on that your top leaves are going

341
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,540
to Brown up uh sometimes we're not grown

342
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,459
for pretty plants sometimes sometimes

343
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,379

366
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,319
moist hey there's a nice little crop for

367
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,120
when we get to curing there we go some

368
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,740
people hate the word moist so I had to

369
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,839
throw in moist out there because you

370
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,220
know it does that all right we've kind

371
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,380
of ranted on about flushing the point

372
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,139
here is flush your damn weed we we can

373
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,338
tell the people that can tell can tell

374
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,220
and they're the ones that you want to

375
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,779
impress if it's Hydro uh flushing is

376
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,100
even more important

377
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,379
um

378
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,180
don't really talk about Hydro growing

379
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,659
very much and there's a reason for that

380
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,939
but um I have zero experience in Hydro I

381
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,458
run an easy cloner that's about as far

382
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,100
as I get I've seen uh Sparky weed from

383
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,599
hydro weed uh or from Hydro systems yeah

384
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,980
you're constantly if you've got a res

385
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,720
full of nutrients you're constantly

386
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,740
pumping that plant it's very important

387
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,180
actually

388
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,339
um it's important throughout the entire

389
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:46,138
growth cycle every couple weeks you

390
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,060
should be flushing

391
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,980
um and using one of those flush products

392
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,078
clear X I was just about to ask how do

393
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,320
you feel about those flush products uh

394
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:59,819
not necessarily for dirt in my opinion

395
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,700
um but uh for for Hydroponics you needed

396
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,320
to help flush your medium off so and

397
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,800
those things break up salt is mainly

398
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,500
what they do cool they're uh

399
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,299
they're all like a sugar of some like a

400
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,860
sucrose or something so I didn't know

401
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,679
that yeah I never researched what they

402
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,259
are yeah I don't know exactly how it

403
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,479

425
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,579
in it that's not what a caregiver does

426
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
it's not what a compassionate person

427
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,819
does it's not what a responsible person

428
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,379
does you're on the other team and you're

429
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,778
growing that weed that should be illegal

430
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,278
you're on this reason that makes

431
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,919
prohibition happen if you're growing

432
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,078
weed that has not been flushed

433

438
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,519
body right that's horrible thing to do

439
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,440
to someone

440
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,700
all right so you flush your plants now

441
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,500
it's time oh we're going to talk about

442
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,459
de-leafing

443
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,919
um

444
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,838
after you flush a few days before

445
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,639
Harvest time you want to get in there

446
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,680
and take off the fan leaves all those

447
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,060
big leaves that are in your way if

448
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,278
they've got what's called a pedial

449
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,539
that's the stem that reaches to the

450
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:46,860
large there's some other people

451
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,419
pronounce it differently you can tweet

452
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,000
me and argue me that's just how I've

453
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,559
read it so you anything with the PDL you

454
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,480
can reach and cut off chop all those

455
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,099
leaves off clean those things out of

456
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,259
your grow room don't just chop them and

457
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,180
leave them on the floor those bring bugs

458
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,919
feed them to your chickens if you've had

459
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,078
a clean grow room you can possibly juice

460
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,458
those if you're into it yeah throw those

461
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,578
right in there with your kale and your

462
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,078
white people smoothie

463
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:11,578
all right so get in there cut off all

464
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,519
those fan leaves

465
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,778
um you can cut off some of the outer

466
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,339
Leaf if you want but you might want to

467
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:19,559
save that if you're making hash just

468
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,760
decide how much trichome is on that if

469
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,439
there's not a trichome on it you can

470
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,179
take it off right now like you mentioned

471
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,000
Girl Scout cookies they always have a

472
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,458
little uh PDO coming out of the nug yeah

473
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,039
such a long one too I you know depending

474
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,500
on how far it is like you said with hash

475
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,059
um some of them are a little closer I'll

476
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,919
keep that one on there just because I

477
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,879
see that little little bit of resin on

478
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:45,059
there and I can get greedy with resin

479
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:47,939
we're resin Farmers bro that's our goals

480
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:50,458
um but yeah if it's very long I I've cut

481
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:55,459
that [ __ ] off you know coming out out

482
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,458
of the bud so clarify that a little bit

483
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,959
I found a knob that'll turn everything

484
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,539
up a little yeah nice all right so uh

485
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,099
cut off all those fan leaves now while

486
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,838
you're flushing you've got a few days

487
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,399
now you know you're flushing you know

488
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,860
Harvest is coming you've taken off the

489
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,839
fan leaves Now's the Time to prepare the

490
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,659
harvesting the trimming and the drying

491
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,399
area you need a space all right let's go

492
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,659
back real quick okay I like that one

493
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,860
more thing

494
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,480
um

495
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,879
how do you feel about like the sweet

496
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,399
eating agents molasses and stuff like

497
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,320
that oh I use this [ __ ] out of molasses

498
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,159
um with my outdoor stuff

499
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,339
um

500
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,860
the first I start flushing really early

501
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,839
um like I actually I started two plants

502
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,800
flushing this week

503
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,940
um

504
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:43,799
uh I give them two molasses feedings uh

505
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,440
before I actually start flushing and

506
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,419
it's just lasses but it's it's pretty

507
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,639
heavy so I know what's going into my

508
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,659
plants and this is uh so try to keep it

509
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,980
basic because I don't want to steer

510
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,838
anybody wrong I want everybody to learn

511
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,639
the right steps but I do sort of

512
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,860
something similar I feed them enzymes

513
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,019
carbohydrates and molasses at the end

514
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,699
for sure so they'll get some hydrozyme

515
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:06,179
has the enzymes I prefer and they'll get

516
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:10,220
the molasses and uh sometimes maybe some

517
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,220
Yucca extract and coconut water

518
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,640
that's Yucca extract and coconut water

519
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:20,039
and sukanet

520
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,020
and hydrazyme on that last flush yeah uh

521
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,838
day so I've got 14 days that's like day

522
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,699
14 that's uh really strong that and then

523
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,318
from then out I flush but I don't

524
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,240
overfeed I feel like I don't over feed

525
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,460
yeah and I've got plenty of space to

526
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,798
flush properly like I can I drag a plant

527
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,779
to a watering area just [ __ ] hose on

528
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,720
it until it's flushed so that's worse

529
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,220
yeah it's actually just I converted the

530
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,380
old bathroom that was in the work joint

531
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,660
and dinner just the flushing spot so the

532
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,840
guy's got a pee with no stalls my

533
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,480
building doesn't have indoor plumbing so

534
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,980
ouch yeah uh guys if you have all that

535
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,720
stuff that you're taking for granted

536
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,179
you're you're way ahead of the game

537
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,079
sometimes yeah

538
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,179
there are guys that have been growing

539
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,619
since before we could talk about growing

540
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,419
you had to go to the hydro shop with

541
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,639
your hat down in your face dude I've got

542
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:08,340
dreadlocks to my ass like rent a car I

543
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,320
get looked at like that guy grows weed

544
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:13,019
even if I'm not at the hydro store so

545
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,058
yeah Colorado is awesome all right so uh

546
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,460
we flushed we've used some sugars and

547
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,899
enzymes and some coconut water and some

548
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,519
Yucca extract you don't have to use them

549
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,840
all at the same time

550
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,220
um you can use these differently the

551
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,779
sukanat may need a little while to break

552
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,579
down so you may need something to help

553
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,500
that happen the enzymes are going to be

554
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,740
good uh

555
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,058
so we have de-leafed uh we're preparing

556
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,140
the dry space right is that where we are

557
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,660
yeah yeah

558
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,580
um very very important Yeah clean up

559
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,759
your drying and trimming space any dust

560
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:44,159
dog hair hippie hair

561
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,319
uh all the crap that's on my table I

562
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,058
think it's just a bunch of dab resin to

563
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,379
tell you the truth but all this all that

564
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,240
[ __ ] is going to end up in your weed

565
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,740
that you're cleaning up and once again

566
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,419
that's just as important as having a

567
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,980
good flush you don't want crap on your

568
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,679
weed you just spent

569
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,419
70-day flowering cycle plus however long

570
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,860
we took to veg that stuff plus if you're

571
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,179
doing a Fino hunt you're risking you

572
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:05,279
know you got to tell which seeds are

573
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,740
good or if they're Outdoors

574
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,200
you know that's that's a big plant too

575
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,759
yeah yeah put a lot of work and nervous

576
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,798
nights into it

577
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,720
and have a nice secure area while we're

578
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,940
at it I did not write that down but have

579
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,740
a nice secure area and think about this

580
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,080
if you're making concentrates every

581
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,640
piece of dust and hair in particulate is

582
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,579
going to end up in your concentrate

583
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,860
somehow like even if it you're blasting

584
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,199
butane over it you're gonna blast dog

585
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,459
hair juice into your hash essentially

586
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,620
you know what I mean I don't know

587
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,058
technically what you're getting but you

588
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,819
know that's what you're gonna find in

589
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:40,918
there it's all gonna end up in your

590
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,379
concentrates you're gonna need so in

591
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,720
your trimming area your work area cover

592
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,220
your table get a plastic cloth you guys

593
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,200
use rubber gloves when you're handling

594
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,880
your plants when they're growing when

595
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,558
you're chopping them

596
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,419
for God's sake please uh you you've seen

597
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,859
how you do fingerprints when you commit

598
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,660
a crime you're doing that to your plants

599
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,939
you're leaving oils and hippie goop and

600
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,460
human goop and Cheeto stains all over

601
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,200
your plants wear some rubber gloves our

602
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,980
oils actually

603
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,080
um

604
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,599
affect the plants for long-term storage

605
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:16,019
and plants that have been handled with

606
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,719
bare hands uh break down faster in my

607
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,960
experience that makes sense okay I think

608
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,600
a BHO dab you can

609
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,579
decarboxylize a BHO dab enough uh with

610
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,558
your fingers oh yeah yeah I think by

611
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,960
Rolling BHO around in your fingers you

612
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:34,500
can decarb it enough to be edible like

613
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,079
processed is Delta 11 THC by your liver

614
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,519
that's how well that's like cannabinoids

615
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,960
yeah imagine so if you can do that by

616
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,359
Rolling it in your hand imagine what we

617
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,519
can do to a trichome on a plant you can

618
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,259
pressure it ruin it kill it yeah it'll

619
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,359
even weird oils that are fighting when

620
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,640
you said decarb relaxing I was thinking

621
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,099
of d-waxing and all that stuff floating

622
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,780
oh man yeah

623
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,759
somebody asked me what is de-waxing we

624
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,379
need to get a hashmaker over to say more

625
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,900
technically what it is but I'll explain

626
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,539
it on a later episode

627
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,038
nothing to do with explaining that so in

628
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:06,558
your trim room you should have comfy

629
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,940
tables you should have some good music

630
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,740
uh everyone's gonna argue over the music

631
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,798
Sorry put on the agriculture podcast

632
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,720
episode one and hit play uh

633
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,639
um I actually like to put up stand up

634
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,740
comedian shows oh that's a good idea I

635
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,140
listen to Comedy I honestly listen to a

636
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,839
lot of Joey Coco Diaz and Joe Rogan yeah

637
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,580
listen to a podcast when I'm trimming uh

638
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,259
one of my favorite podcasts hasn't

639
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,058
posted an episode in quite a while I'm a

640
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,759
little annoyed what's up Adam Mill

651
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,380
possibly we're gonna need to keep it uh

652
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,480
between 60 and 70 degrees you can go up

653
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,559
to 75 degrees if you need to if it's you

654
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,538
know in your bedroom or something you're

655
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,418
gonna be all right don't stress but keep

656
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,980
in mind though that heat is

657
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,280
um one of the biggest enemies of a

658
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,620
dragon plant yes and also you want it

659
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,298
dark yeah light I know it sounds weird

660
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,798
you've had all kinds of light beating

661
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:21,900
down on your plants for months but now

662
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,879
we want it dark we want those to stop

663
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,500
growing and degrading we want to kind of

664
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,220
suspend the animation right where we are

665
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,659
it protects the the trichromeds yes yes

666
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,220
we want to we picked them at the right

667
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,679
maturity we don't want them going much

668
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,740
further we also want our humidity at 40

669
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,059
if we can uh not much more than that if

670
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,579
you go any lower you're going to dry too

671
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,079
quickly if you go any higher uh of

672
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,939
course you risk molds and it's going to

673
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,399
take too damn long to dry if you're in

674
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,100
the Dirty South do the best you can good

675
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,900
luck yeah Us in Colorado it's funny that

676
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,279
you say that because in the South you

677
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,659
read stories they're like so when you

678
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,418
harvest your weed you got to dry it for

679
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,559
20 days and I'm like what the [ __ ] 20

680
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,240
days and then you read in Colorado

681
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,038
you're like so cut it down five days

682
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,319
later you got dried buds you're like oh

683
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,019
yeah they must be must be in Colorado in

684
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,119
February it really varies from region to

685
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,859
region yeah and even like what's side of

686
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,739
the state you're on humans dry out in

687
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,178
Colorado yeah yeah so so you got your

688
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,980
fan you got your dehumidifier your

689
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,720
humidifier try to have if you can afford

690
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,140
it if you can do it put a carbon filter

691
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,700
and a blower in your drying room yeah

692
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,559
harvesting plants stink

693
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,740
very much sorry guys I'm choking on a

694
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,720
dab over here uh harvesting plants

695
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,038
your neighbors will smell it ten times

696
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,440
more than you you've been around them

me yep and no he's hungry so you got

713
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,939
that carbon filter also you need a

714
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,679
hygrometer that just tells you what the

715
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,240
humidity is and a thermometer they sell

716
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,059
a great one at high grow indoor growing

717
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,099
supplies yes yes also that is something

718
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:21,720
you can get at Walmart anywhere in the

719
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:23,519
nation Lowe's has uh remote control uh

720
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,200
thermometer hygrometers you can set the

721
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,400
unit in the room and then you can carry

722
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,900
the thing around with you and whatever

723
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,038
you're curious you look at the thing and

724
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,679
it tells you you don't have to run to

725
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:35,519
the grow room and look my dad has one

726
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,519
um it has a chick on it

727
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,079
um and uh he seriously got this at

728
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,000
Lowe's or Walmart

729
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,759
um but when it's hot she's in a bikini

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,740
and when it's cold she's in a coat and a

731
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,200
scarf and everything all bundled up it's

732
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,620
hilarious that's a great the mother I

733
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,140
can see your dad smiling at that one

734
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:58,019
I'm gonna put more heat on your mic

735
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,820
there we go all right so uh we've got

736
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,798
yeah the road the rooms are looking good

737
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,658
we've got a place to harvest we got a

738
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:05,879
place to dry now you need a spot to hang

739
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,960
your buds or your whole plants depending

740
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,280
on how you want to do it we'll talk

741
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,558
about that in a minute

742
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,899
uh set up a hanging space with plenty of

743
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,639
space between your plants if you have a

744
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,320
small crop you can use a coat hanger put

745
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,059
two plants on one coat hanger if they're

746
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,220
little like three gallon plot kind of

747
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,200
guys if you've got uh

748
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,480
five gallon pot hopefully you've made

749
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,980
enough pot to where you need a one coat

750
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,960
hanger per plant any bigger than that

751
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,079
we're gonna need little hanging lines

752
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,640
from the ceiling uh I use hemp twine and

753
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,500
freaking Hooks and just put hooks in

754
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,880
each end of the wall and run some twine

755
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,460
across some of you guys may not have

756
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,100
space fishing line works good too yeah

757
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,778
fishing line is perfect uh any kind of

758
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:44,278
string to hang it up you just want them

759
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,140
you know I've seen guys take chicken

760
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,579
wire and make a big cylinder out of it

761
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,320
and that way you got a bunch of hanging

762
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,599
spaces at different layers that's

763
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,879
basically what we do at the farm okay uh

764
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,778
tomato cages work great too yeah recycle

765
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,700
that tomato cage uh you know a little a

766
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:01,500
long time ago I harvested a crop and

767
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,659
dried it in the hydro Hut that the crop

768
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,919
grew in just took out the light flipped

769
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,600
the crop hung it upside down right

770
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,120
inside there kept all the blowers going

771
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,519
kept the carbon filter going beautiful

772
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,959
crop that was awesome worked very well I

773
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,839
wish I had the space to be able to do

774
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,880
that yes yeah yeah

775
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,980
it's moving yeah

776
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,600
um avoid the drying racks if at all

777
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,400
possible yeah a lot of people were

778
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,079
talking about those online the other day

779
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,700
when I was talking about drying uh those

780
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,379
put a dent in your they make a flat side

781
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,179
on your weed they make it take taste

782
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,559
longer uh when you start squishing the

783
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,120
bud together like that you're messing up

784
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,700
your trichomes and your flavors you're

785
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,019
trapping in air trapping in chlorophyll

786
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,360
you're trapping in moisture which is

787
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:40,918
what we try to get out raise chance of

788
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,759
mold

789
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,380
um

790
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,839
it centralizes a whole bunch of humidity

791
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,120
um and I've always felt the mesh damages

792
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:52,319
the bud yeah just shaking around and

793
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,000
stuff like trying to poke through the

794
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,798
mash and then you always end up with I

795
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,298
have to put uh something underneath

796
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:59,400
those to catch all the stuff that falls

797
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,980
out there's so much that falls off I

798
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,179
always wonder what should I do with this

799
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,278
although that was a few years ago I know

800
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:08,220
what to do with it I know but I quit

801
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:11,400
using those so I was like you make BHO

802
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm not sure where you came from

803
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,538
um it is useful for if you have gigantic

804
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,000
plants

805
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,679
um all the the larf and the little buds

806
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,099
that you

807
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,840
end up with inadvertently you know so

808
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,759
always seems like you have a pile of

809
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,918
that stuff no matter how hard you try to

810
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,119
fight it don't be mad if you chop a butt

811
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,520
in half on your first trim session

812
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,979
either that happens that always happens

813
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,960
occasionally

814
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,900
all right so we've got the rooms built

815
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,480
up we're wearing rubber gloves

816
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,400
um let's see have everything done before

817
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,298
you chop down don't be scrambling around

818
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,519
yeah be relaxed this is really when this

819
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:52,139
I've seen a lot of good crops

820
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,639
go right up to the point where it's time

821
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,860
to put scissors to them and that's when

822
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,360
somebody [ __ ] them up or right after

823
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,500
you put scissors to it and trimmed it

824
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,298
and then put it all in a tupperware

825
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,940
while it was wet or hung it out too long

826
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:06,058
to dry yeah like this is where it counts

827
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,460
you guys if you've spent 60 days 70 days

828
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,678
on a flowering crop let's do the Harvest

829
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,700
Right This is where this is where this

830
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,840
is where the patient's real this is

831
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,720
where the money happens my aunt in a

832
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,278
highly illegal State Grill crop when I

833
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,278
was younger

834
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,839
um and she didn't know how to handle any

835
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,720
of this and of course there was no

836
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:31,079
information this was the 80s she stuck

837
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,000
it in a black trash bag and then hung it

838
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,759
in her basement and

839
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,099
there were swamps in the area of the

840
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,079
country she lived in and uh or not her

841
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:43,259
basement but her attic

842
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,058
um and needless to say uh it created a

843
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,879
whole bunch of mold that sounds

844
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,579
disgusting yeah a horrible waste of a

845
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,419
summer's work especially in this Locale

846
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:56,460
oh yeah rescue time your life for moldy

847
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,038
buds terrible

848
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,240
she was a crazy one so be prepared be a

849
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,558
Boy Scout when it comes to Growing your

850
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,819
crop you should always be thinking two

851
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,440
weeks ahead in your pot plants because

852
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,658
anything you do today you're not going

853
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,940
to see it for seven to ten days probably

854
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:12,720
anything you've messed up on in this in

855
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,880
the season uh here's your chance to you

856
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,759
know make a little ride of it but that's

857
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,919
a good point yeah get on it so so I

858
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,259
guess this is the time where we are

859
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,340
going to get the plants and harvest them

860
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,640
right

861
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:29,158
yeah okay uh we should also Branch out

862
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,559
to uh dry trim and wet trim a little bit

863
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,580
before we get too far uh the way I'm

864
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,019
going to talk about how I harvest a

865
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:35,759
plant I'm gonna hypothetically have a

866
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,619
three gallon pot I'm gonna drag that

867
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,278
three gallon pot with my three foot tall

868
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:42,839
pot plant over to a nice area where I've

869
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,099
got plenty of space I'm just going to

870
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,220
chop the whole plant

871
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:49,139
the way that I do it I chop the plant uh

872
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,120
just just above where the first nodes

873
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,559
pop out so that I don't have a lot of

874
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,199
stick hanging off the edge chop that

875
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,898
boom it's unnecessary water flip the

876
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,399
plant upside down I use a fuzzy stick it

877
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,839
looks like a pipe cleaner just wrap that

878
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,699
[ __ ] right around those bottom two

879
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:04,019
nodes so that I got a nice hanger and I

880
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,399
leave some hanging off and then I tied

881
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,960
that onto wherever it's going to hang

882
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,879
from different situations at this point

883
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,100
I hang in different areas so we'll say

884
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,419
I'm using my main dry room uh just hang

885
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,639
it from the dry line that hangs up there

886
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,620
boom it's hanging in there I myself dry

887
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,320
trim so I've got a plant that's been

888
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:21,000
flushed de-leafed

889
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,619
um my rooms are clean everything's going

890
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,720
properly now I've just got this giant

891
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:27,418
wet plant that is mostly little leaves

892
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,839
and just donkey dick buds hanging upside

893
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:33,240
down in my dry room temps are perfect

894
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,220
so if we were gonna wet trim

895
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,899
this is where uh wet trim and dry trim

896
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,058
would Branch off a little bit right yeah

897
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,678
I believe so okay I just want to keep

898
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,599
everybody on the same page sometimes we

899
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,980
uh we go too fast because we've done all

900
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,719
this and sometimes people are like you

901
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,599
skipped like four days worth of growth

902
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,399
so I just want to keep it all so if

903
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,778
you're gonna wet trim

904
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,158
the difference between white trim and

905
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:54,659
dry trim is obviously you let your

906
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,740
plants dry if you're going to dry trim

907
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,179
and then you get in there and take the

908
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,679
leaves off what trim you would do it

909
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,880
right now you've cut the plant down you

910
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,380
got to hang it up now it's time to get

911
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,059
in there and chop everything off you

912
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,278
trim it into the bud that's going to be

913
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:07,440
smoked at this point right uh you don't

914
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,819
have to go as close as you look like you

915
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,019
want to because those little leaves are

916
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:12,000
going to shrink up into the butt a

917
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:15,418
little but still do a hell of a good job

918
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,919
getting in there uh Jesse said earlier I

919
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,360
definitely prefer dry trimming Jesse and

920
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,038
I agree that you say dry trimming we

921
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,240
agreed earlier that some of those

922
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,579
Southern States we were talking about

923
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,960
with a lot of humidity you guys may want

924
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:26,699
a wet trim because you need to get those

925
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,940
leaves off of there and kind of speed up

926
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,380
that dry process here in Colorado

927
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,600
there's not a lot of humidity sometimes

928
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,340
it gets super dry we're trying to slow

929
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,959
it down we need to slow it down we leave

930
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,079
those leaves on so we're going to talk

931
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,500
about mostly about dry trimming this is

932
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,418
wet trim is basically uh I cut the buds

933
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,940
off of the sticks or I have a good hand

934
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,620
sized Bud more in rubber gloves I try to

935
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,538
hold on to just a stem and then I spin

936
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,119
that bud in my hand and just slowly clip

937
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:56,819
off all of the leaves you can trim it to

938
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,019
your preference if it's going to you if

939
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,519
you're trying to put it to Market you

940
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,139
got to trim that [ __ ] close it's got to

941
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,240
look good take off if there's not a lot

942
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,340
of trichome on that leaf take it off if

943
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,538
that leaf is sticking out take it off we

944
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,398
don't we're not Leaf heads we're

945
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:11,819
potheads we want to smoke pot not leaves

946
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:14,459
yep so that's basically wet trim I have

947
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,960
some patients that they don't want it

948
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,759
trimmed at all but they're old school so

949
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,079
uh so I guess you should leave it on the

950
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,519
Sticks no I should say that leave it

951
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,960
kind of on the sticks don't cut it into

952
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,480
two smaller parts because you need a way

953
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,980
to hang it uh you know how the branch is

954
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,899
a branch and then there's a little node

955
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,759
coming off where your buds grow say one

956
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,199
of those little Branch Parts as a little

957
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,278
hook and then you can hang that in your

958
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,899
dry room because after you get done

959
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,460
trimming these buds you want to hang

960
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,500
them up so they don't get a flat spot in

961
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,600
your cure Rack or your dry rack you want

962
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,640
them hanging

963
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:44,519
so trim them up hang them up

964
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,080
and then let those dry uh they those wet

965
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,359
buds need to dry after they've been

966
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,460
trimmed until you grab them and bend the

967
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,558
stick and the stick should pop and snap

968
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,960
it should just go crack right on you and

969
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,759
that'll be obvious when it happens so

970
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,600
depending on where you are that should

971
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:02,278
take between five to maybe 15 days just

972
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,339
depending your location and they dry

973
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,179
from the outside in so

974
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,879
um

975
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,880
work the [ __ ] I'm stoned uh we're in wet

976
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,620
treatment still right yeah so like I

977
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,140
mean the outside of the bud is going to

978
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,658
be dry before the entire Bud is actually

979
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,899
dry right don't know

980
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:23,640
you know get too happy and jump the gun

981
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:26,339
there yeah it's really going to make a

982
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,038
huge difference uh just slightly wet

983
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,398
buds to dry buds to

984
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,200
properly cured buds this little so

985
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,039
Jesse's learning how to use a straw here

986
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,580
on the podcast

987
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,678
[Laughter]

988
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,240
the the cough wasn't that impressive the

989
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,240
look on his face was like did I just

990
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,480
cough from a straw yeah you did bro yeah

991
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,278
all right uh yeah wet trim I don't do

992
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,740
that so let's talk about dry drip uh

993
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:55,140
guys dry trim I prefer it it's easier uh

994
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,519
dry trim you're gonna hang I hang the

995
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,380
whole plant I've heard uh people

996
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,579
chopping the brand I've grown I'm

997
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,019
talking about a three gallon pot here so

998
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,898
I'd hang the whole plant some people

999
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,220
chop it into smaller pieces uh if you

1000
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:06,658
can get it into just branches that's

1001
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,280
cool I like to let the whole thing hang

1002
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,139
I feel like it dries up just the right

1003
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,019
speed here just because of where we are

1004
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,179
for for indoor plants I totally agree

1005
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:16,918
all right so you're growing those big

1006
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,079
outdoor plants you've got to chop them

1007
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,759
into smaller parts yeah outdoor plants

1008
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,980
with three levels of cages around them

1009
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,480
that's not really an option yeah you

1010
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,679
can't even get out of the cage and also

1011
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,300
I told somebody to cut down the whole

1012
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,619
plant and they said I grow a scrog so

1013
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,820
you guys are going to have to cut out

1014
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,200
branches so we'll just go with this

1015
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,300
we'll go we've got a bunch of branches

1016
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,219
now uh we're cutting off one branch at a

1017
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,859
time we hang those they dry

1018
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,838
uh however long it takes just kind of

1019
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,299
sort of similar to the wet trim we're

1020
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,878
gonna let them hang until

1021
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,560
right before they snap when that first

1022
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,598
part snaps now it's time to get to work

1023
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,799
because your stuff's gonna dry slowly

1024
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,059
and you're going to catch up you're

1025
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,919
gonna get a little behind in trimming

1026
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,418
but you'll catch up yeah especially if

1027
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,918
you got a lot of work to do hopefully

1028
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,079
you got a lot of work to do yeah had

1029
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,239
that thousand watt light remember oh

1030
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,619
yeah yeah and the 52 ounces we're trying

1031
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,858
to grow outside

1032
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,858
foreign

1033
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,740
ounce per week is all we need that's a

1034
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,760
flashback to an old episode yeah I hope

1035
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,219
you guys remember that because I got

1036
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,599
where we're headed uh so we got these

1037
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:13,858
dried plants you talk you chopped your

1038
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,079
plants down you hung them you let them

1039
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,480
dry now you've cut off a stick go to

1040
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,160
your drying area and you got your stick

1041
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,420
uh pretty much just take your thumbs and

1042
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,639
just knock those little dried leaves

1043
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,680
right off uh put them get a little

1044
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,699
container and have that or you can just

1045
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,199
knock the leaves right into that

1046
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,399
container because you're gonna make some

1047
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,679
sort of concentrates out of that

1048
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,660
hopefully or food or something with your

1049
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,919
gloves on with your gloves on keep your

1050
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:36,179
gloves on please I don't want to eat

1051
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,180
your skin Flakes and your fingernail

1052
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:40,319
dirt so you got these Buds and I kind of

1053
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,819
hold it

1054
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
I don't know I kind of I'm just

1055
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,940
picturing the way I do it it looks like

1056
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,440
I'm playing Nintendo I got my thumbs

1057
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,320
just going and I'm just knocking leaves

1058
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,740
off and he looks like he's playing snake

1059
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,760
on a Nokia phone yeah texting on the

1060
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:54,899
iPhone that's pretty much what you're

1061
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,160
doing you're just holding that thing and

1062
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,000
just knock the leaves off you don't even

1063
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,440
have to

1064
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,059
you can see what you want to take off

1065
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,920
once it's dry so trim it to your

1066
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:03,000
preference this little triangle leaves

1067
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,139
it stick out I'm actually trimming this

1068
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,219
bud that's sitting on the table with my

1069
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,139
fingers these little triangle leaves you

1070
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,519
can just pluck those right off and then

1071
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,199
pluck that off and you can see where the

1072
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,519
bud is and where the leaf ends if you've

1073
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:16,019
done it right

1074
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:18,900
oops I use scissors but it's the exact

1075
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,358
same process yeah some strains uh Girl

1076
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,920
Scout cookies and Yeti uh-oh no scissors

1077
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,119
necessary you just roll that around in

1078
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,059
your hand and those dried leaves fall

1079
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,440
right off yeah and then uh so these

1080
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,179
dried nuggets they're pretty much dry I

1081
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,179
throw those in a bin and then when I'm

1082
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:35,759
done I jar them up uh that's kind of how

1083
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:37,199
or the Cure process starts for both of

1084
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,720
these plants once those sticks are

1085
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,519
snapping on your wet trim take the

1086
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,959
leaves off

1087
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,338
throw it in a bin and they're ready to

1088
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,039
go into jars when you're done trimming

1089
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:48,358
everything the dry trim now that you've

1090
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,619
knocked the leaves off you got that in a

1091
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,019
bit now we're ready to pretty much go

1092
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,640
into jars and uh that's kind of where

1093
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:56,579
the curing process would start don't you

1094
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:58,739
think yeah have we skipped anything

1095
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,500
I'm sure we have but I'm really stoned

1171
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,098
just stopped myself something from

1172
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,599
saying [ __ ] cuss jar there's only this

1173
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,099
is only a rule that applies to me but if

1174
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,380
the guests want to participate they can

1175
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,519
the cus jar if I say the f word the F

1176
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,099
word's the only one that counts in this

1177
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,719
Kush jar uh if I say the f word you guys

1178
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,460
tweet me and remind me every time I say

1179
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,500
it on the podcast starting on episode 30

1180
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,599
that's this show don't go back in time

1181
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,219
and cost me money every time from now

1182
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,800
forward that I say the f word on a show

1183
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,539
it cost me a dollar okay after a few

1184
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,859
episodes if I quit saying if I don't

1185
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,079
quit saying the f word I will increase

1186
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:08,759
my donation amount I'll crank it up to

1187
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,019
five dollars and then after I'm not

1188
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,579
committing to any amount of episodes I

1189
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,019
want to see how I do because if I do the

1190
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:14,339
worse I do the more money I have to pay

1191
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,960
because it'll hurt me more a dollar

1192
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,000
doesn't hurt my feelings but it reminds

1193
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,440
me five dollars you go damn that was

1194
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,679
five dollars ten bucks you start going

1195
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,019
this is getting expensive so we're gonna

1196
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:27,000
increase it slowly I have a charity

1197
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,199
um that I have in mind that I will tell

1198
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,480

1200
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
deserve the donations it's not an

1201

comments from Stitcher as well the

1250
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,980
reason I like good reviews and good

1251
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,900
ratings is because that helps us move up

1252
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,420
in the ranks which just gets us which

1253
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,160
gets us seen by more listeners which

1254
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,800
gets more people growing quality product

1255
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,139
which gets less [ __ ] product out on the

1256
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,820
street so we can improve everybody's

1257
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:22,078
Garden by making the podcast a little

1258
