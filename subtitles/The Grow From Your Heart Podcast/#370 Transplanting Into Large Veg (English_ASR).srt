3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,160
from your heart podcast this episode is

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,380

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,880
garden I highly recommend the hella dank

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:29,278
seed company and you can find them at

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:31,589
www.cdxzipstream.com farms this stuff

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,530
smells like skunky strawberries and just

10
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,369
funky fruit and if you dab it at a nice

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,259
low temperature

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,750
it tastes like strawberries and cream

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,729
with a hint of skunky gas enos in the

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,439
background it is very delicious it's

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,390
almost like eating some strawberry

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,308
shortcake at the gas station that's what

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,590
it kind of smells like to me the lab

18
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:51,869
test on the front here says seventy two

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,379
point three percent THC with a total

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,759
cannabinoid content of 83.9% I really

21
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:57,238
like this concentrate it tastes

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,549
delicious

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,649
the high is great and the texture and

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,479
consistency are beautiful there is just

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,579
enough Terp sauce in here and it's got

26
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,200
some nice chunky crystals I am really

27
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,489
happy with that purchase great

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,189

support all right podcast world this is

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,368
going to be another grow lesson if

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,109
you've been following along you know

41
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,540
I've been doing a long series of grow

42
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,719
lessons that series starts at episode

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,790
351 in this series of lessons we started

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,769
by setting a goal for our grow then we

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,750
decided a good place for our growth then

46
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,390
we acquire the appropriate equipment and

47
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,489
set it up then we either acquired seeds

48
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,159
or clones and we got those growing at

49
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,560
this point in my grow lessons we should

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,390
have small plants that are approximately

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,219
eight to twelve inches tall and they are

52
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,739
in small pots they are probably in

53
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,750
either beer cups or four inch pots or

54
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,578
maybe six or eight inch net pots but

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,930
we've got small plants they should be

56
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:08,489
nice and healthy at this point they

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,649
should have nice branching coming out of

58
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,840
them they should not have any bugs or

59
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,919
any powdery mildew hopefully at this

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
point we don't have a

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,909
burned leaves or any signs of

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,330
deficiencies hopefully we have got a

63
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:23,579
nice developed thriving root system to

64
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,989
work with now if most of those things

65
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,120
are accurate we've got a nice healthy

66
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,530
plant that is growing it's branching it

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,120
looks healthy its thriving it's not

68
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,580
struggling and we've got a nice healthy

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,680
root system it is time to transplant our

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,050
small plants into our larger pot our

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,000
finishing pot and start the large veg

72
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,980
phase now these plants will probably

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
finish out in these pots unless you want

74
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,268
to transplant one more time into an even

75
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,610
larger pot I like to go from the small

76
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,349
pot into my finishing pot I'm generally

77
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,630
going to go into a three gallon or a

78
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,699
five gallon or a seven gallon in an

79
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,979
indoor garden you guys may choose to go

80
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,379
larger you may want to go from the small

81
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,389
six inch net pot maybe to a one gallon

82
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,829
then maybe into your twenty or thirty

83
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,958
gallon if you're gonna do something like

84
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,060
that I talked in a previous episode

85
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,489
about why it's a good idea to use a

86
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,890
smaller container for smaller plants we

87
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,299
don't need to water this giant area when

88
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,768
we've got a tiny plant right in the

89
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,750
middle so if you're gonna go to like a

90
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,760
twenty or thirty gallon pot you may want

91
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,409
to go from the cup to maybe a one gallon

92
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,239
maybe a three gallon then later on

93
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,340
transplant that into your twenty or

94
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,959
thirty but it gets challenging when you

95
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,609
go to transplant larger plants if you're

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,319
not experienced with it you can cause

97
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,329
damage you need to lay that larger plant

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,759
on its side you need to remove that pot

99
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,650
they need to pop a much larger plant it

100
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,389
does get difficult but I have faith in

101
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,879
you that you can do it if you choose to

102
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,169
transplant twice just be careful in this

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,849
lesson we're gonna focus on

104
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,559
transplanting one time we're gonna go

105
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,810
from this small beer cup or our four

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,430
inch or our six inch net pot or maybe an

107
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,250
eight inch pot and we're going to pot

108
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,500
into a three or a five or a seven gallon

109
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,109
pot for my example alright let's talk a

110
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,239
little bit about pots and soil I did a

111
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,269
long episode about choosing pots and

112
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,819
soil but let's do a brief recap I like

113
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,950
to use the plastic nursery pots in a

114
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,500
home grow in a commercial facility I

115
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,649
like to use a root pot one of the fabric

116
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,289
pots in most applications I am using a

117
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,750
three gallon pot you can use whatever

118
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:18,089
kind of pots make you happy as long as

119
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,370
it's going to get you to your goal the

120
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,288
thing I find most important is to make

121
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,019
sure that whatever container you use

122
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:26,788
that it has plenty of holes for drainage

123
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,659
make sure that when you water this plant

124
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,819
the

125
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,610
says water has some way to escape from

126
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,649
the bottom of that pot the nursery pots

127
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,660
have plenty of holes in them already the

128
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,310
fabric pots will drain naturally just

129
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,230
because they're match those work

130
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,120
perfectly if you're going to use a Home

131
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,550
Depot bucket or something like that

132
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,889
make sure you drill plenty of drainage

133
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,710
holes in your container now let's talk

134
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,659
briefly about soil or soilless mix you

135
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,120
don't have to buy a really expensive

136
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,850
soil if you're going to feed your plants

137
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,149
with bottled nutrients you can buy an

138
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,700
inert medium you don't need a soil or

139
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,919
soilless mix with a lot of nutrients and

140
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,750
a lot of stuff in there you're going to

141
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,790
be on top of fertilizing these plants

142
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,680
with your bottled nutrients so we don't

143
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,629
need to pay extra money for a soil or a

144
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,009
soilless mix it's got a bunch of stuff

145
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,110
in there that will give us the

146
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,209
opportunity to burn our plants because

147
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,949
we're going to add them to a soil that's

148
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,139
got nutrients in it then we're going to

149
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,180
add bottled nutrients on top of that we

150
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,490
do run the risk of over fertilizing the

151
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,860
plants in that situation so we don't

152
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
really need an over fertilized soil or

153
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,850
soilless mix we need something more

154
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,650
inert maybe something with some mykos or

155
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,180
some beneficial fungus in there that

156
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,969
would be advantageous but we don't

157
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,620
really need a lot of nutrients whatever

158
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,810
medium you choose to purchase I

159
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,970
recommend you get something with a lot

160
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,889
of aeration in it either a lot of

161
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,540
perlite or a lot of personal light and

162
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,750
if it doesn't come with plenty of

163
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,270
aeration product already in it buy a bag

164
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,220
of perlite and amend it yourself now the

165
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,810
amount of perlite or personal light

166
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,360
you're going to need to add to your soil

167
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,939
or soilless mix will depend on the

168
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,949
fluffiness and the amount of aeration in

169
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,509
that medium when you purchase it I'm not

170
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,129
sure what you're going to purchase so

171
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm not sure what to recommend as a

172
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:13,620
ratio of how much perlite I like it

173
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,189
fluffy when I'm working with Coco I mix

174
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,980
three bags of cocoa and one 5-gallon

175
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,199
bucket of perlite and one 5-gallon

176
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,290
bucket of Percel light now that gives me

177
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,149
about 25 to 33 gallon pots worth of

178
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,400
material to work with you guys can

179
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,439
reduce that recipe as needed for your

180
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,810
garden now if I were working with soil

181
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,759
or a soilless mix I might not use as

182
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,370
much perlite I may reduce that perlite

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,069
by about half you don't need in my

184
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,470
opinion I don't need as much aeration in

185
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,659
soil and soilless makes as I do in the

186
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,630
cocoa I feel like the cocoa holds a lot

187
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,280
more water so it also pushes out a lot

188
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,540
more air and it kind of crushes the

189
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,159
plants a little more it gets heavier

190
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,470
because it's got so much water in there

191
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,600
the soil and soilless mix doesn't hold

192
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,520
as much water so it doesn't get as heavy

193
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,470
and it doesn't crush the roots as much

194
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,359
so you don't need as much perlite maybe

195
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,000
go half as much maybe if you're doing

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,710
three bags of soil do half of a

197
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,269
five-gallon bucket of personal light and

198
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,949
a half of a five-gallon bucket of

199
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:12,719
perlite if you guys aren't going to buy

200
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,199
the personal I understand it's more

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
expensive

202
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,009
it's another product to buy you will get

203
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,019
by with just using perlite perlite is

204
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,639
just fine for this situation if you only

205
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,060
want to buy the one product that will be

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,610
fine

207
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,160
so three bags of soil and maybe one bag

208
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,780
of perlite for this application and I

209
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,100
know I work in larger batches than a lot

210
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,409
of people if you want to reduce this

211
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,560
recipe for a smaller garden I think they

212
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,150
sell the bags of soil in 1.75 cubic

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,920
yards is what I think most of those bags

214
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,779
of dirt are or at least the bags of

215
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,420
cocoa I was buying her one point seven

216
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,519
seven cubic yards if you buy a one point

217
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,220
seven seven cubic yards of dirt makes

218
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,529
that with a third of a five-gallon

219
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,270
bucket of perlite so just fill the

220
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,519
bucket up about a third maybe half way

221
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,409
if you want to go hard then mix that in

222
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,419
really well with your soil so that it's

223
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,220
nicely even evenly mixed in there with

224
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,020
everything else so that you just see the

225
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,220
little white spots everywhere then you

226
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,769
know you've got plenty of aeration

227
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,420
throughout your entire root zone now

228
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:09,180
while we're mixing up perlite into our

229
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,790
soil why not mix in some sort of root

230
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,370
inoculant powder in a previous episode I

231
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,160
talked all about Michel Raizel fungi

232
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,709
let's add a mycorrhizae product to our

233
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,630
mix right now and get it distributed all

234
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,069
throughout the soil something like the

235
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,560
great white granulars would work

236
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,089
perfectly you can use great white shark

237
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,550
on its own just sprinkle it in there

238
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:32,309
right now you can use plus life right

239
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,320
now any sort of powdered myko product

240
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,909
would work wonderfully right now

241
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,890
sprinkle it right into the dirt as

242
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,299
you're mixing it up so I feel like

243
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,069
that's a great way to segue into

244
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,889
actually starting to do the

245
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,990
transplanting process we've got healthy

246
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,389
plants we've got a container we've got a

247
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,909
good soil or soilless mix it's well

248
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,309
aerated we've put a myko product in

249
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:55,709
there now let's actually get to work

250
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:57,839
step number one you guys is always fine

251
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,940
to the Bluetooth speaker and put on the

252
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,920
growth from your heart podcast it helps

253
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,870
you grow it makes the plants happy and

254
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,179
it puts you in a good mood to create a

255
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,399
positive garden environment so step

256
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,469
number one find the Bluetooth speaker or

257
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,059
find your earbuds get your earbuds in

258
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,769
get hooked up with the growth from your

259
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:17,309
heart podcast that is going to make your

260
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,990
garden grow so much more rapidly it's

261
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,489
gonna make you grow more rapidly it's

262
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,350
gonna make everything go better so step

263
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,120
number one find the growth from your

264
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,889
heart podcast get it at an acceptable

265
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,320
volume and get that going in the growth

266
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:30,929
step number two get some rubber gloves I

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,210
often overlook this step we should

268
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,250
always be wearing gloves if we're coming

269
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,019
in contact with mykos if we're coming in

270
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,850
contact with the roots if we're coming

271
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,220
in contact with bottled nutrients we

272
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,110
should be wearing gloves also if you're

273
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,879
gonna be sprinkling those myko products

274
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,560
over your topsoil just all willy-nilly

275
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,509
maybe you might want to consider some

276
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,179
sort of a mask we don't really want to

277
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,950
breathe in microbe products so we've got

278
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,329
the pod cast on we're gloved up we've

279
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,550
got a face mask on you got your

280
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,500
dreadlocks tied up hopefully your nicely

281
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:00,419
medicated if that's appropriate wherever

282
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,460
you work or whatever you're growing now

283
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,588
let's actually get to business here we

284
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,720
need to fill our container whatever size

285
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,150
container we chose we need to fill it

286
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,680
with our well-mixed medium we've got our

287
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,600
soilless mix we've got our cocoa

288
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,399
hopefully we've got a bunch of perlite

289
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,080
in there hopefully we added a myko

290
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
product to there we've got it all mixed

291
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,759
up now it's ready to go into a container

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,649
I like to fill my containers by using a

293
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,569
smaller container just a scoop dirt out

294
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,338
of the bag or whatever container it's in

295
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,830
and just dump it right into the pot that

296
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,810
it's going into just fill it up fill it

297
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,280
up most of the way if you're filling up

298
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,079
a three gallon five gallon or seven

299
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,958
gallon pot fill it up most of the way

300
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,970
but leave yourself about an inch and a

301
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,979
half or maybe two inches at the top

302
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,080
where you don't fill it all the way up

303
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,089
all the way to the brim leave yourself

304
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,190
about an inch and a half two inches so

305
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,140
that when we water we've got some room

306
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,459
to put water in the pot you don't want

307
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,439
to pour water on the pot and watch it

308
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,519
run right off the top you don't want to

309
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,560
have to stand there and pour water

310
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
really slowly to where you can get that

311
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,009
whole quarter or half or gallon of water

312
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,659
into the pot so you can water it

313
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,669
appropriately I like to be able to just

314
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,049
splash a gallon of water on top of a

315
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:06,179
seven gallon pot and just watch it

316
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:07,199
saturate that whole top area and then

317
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,929
you can just walk away and do the

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,100
back spot if you fill it up too far you

319
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:12,750
gotta just stand there and pour it

320
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,399
slowly it's where the water saturates

321
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,830
into the medium and drains down a little

322
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
bit then you can pour a little more

323
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,000
leave yourself some space also in the

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,590
future we may choose to top dress these

325
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,330
plants we may want to add some worm

326
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,960
castings you may want to add some bat

327
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,940
guano

328
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,830
you may just add some fresh soil with

329
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,870
some charged-up nutrients in it to the

330
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,700
top layer so leave yourself in the room

331
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,009
so that you've got options and you've

332
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,080
got watering space now as you are

333
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,970
filling your container pack your medium

334
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,830
in there slightly tight you don't want

335
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,779
it packed real snug but you don't want

336
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,240
it fluffy and loops we want to make the

337
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,100
roots work to dig down into the dirt and

338
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,049
have some more to grow and kind of do a

339
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,700
little exercise to get in there but we

340
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:52,319
also don't want to suffocate them and

341
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,450
make it so hard that the roots simply

342
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,520
can't grow into the medium so you have

343
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,410
to pack it a little bit but don't crush

344
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,569
it so so tight to where the roots can't

345
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:02,370
even grow now if you packed it too

346
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,960
loosely you will notice on the first

347
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,639
couple of waterings you'll just get a

348
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,900
giant hole in the center all the dirt

349
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,100
will just cave in you'll create a hole

350
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,840
in the middle and then you'll have to

351
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,370
repack it put more dirt in there then

352
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,930
reward it that's okay

353
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,730
you didn't mess up you just should have

354
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,039
gone a little harder in the first place

355
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,690
you will learn if you go too hard the

356
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,309
roots just aren't gonna grow if you go

357
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,570
too soft the water is just gonna fall

358
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,969
right through and you will definitely

359
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,520
get indicators so fill your container

360
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,870
pack it slightly tight I usually just

361
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,000
use the palm of my hand and I give it

362
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,500
just a few Pat's I throw in just a few

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,970
scoops of dirt just to give myself a few

364
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,529
inches of dirt and then I just Pat it in

365
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,639
and then I throw in some order and then

366
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,959
I just Pat it in you can hear me just

367
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,120
happen on the table here it's not that

368
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,710
hard just patting it down just getting

369
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,970
the dirt nice and even in there then I

370
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,129
just pour more dirt on top of it just

371
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,450
Pat it down I'd rather pour some in and

372
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,189
then pack it down and then pour some in

373
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,509
and pack it down instead of fill it up

374
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,010
and then try to pack all that down I

375
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,559
feel like that's kind of it's not really

376
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,299
as productive as packing each little

377
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,159
layer so pour some dirt in there packing

378
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,389
down pour some dirt packing down get

379
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,850
yourself up to about an inch and a half

380
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:02,490
or two inches to the top now here's

381
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,769
where it gets fun we have got our three

382
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,990
our five or seven gallon pot filled with

383
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,000
our appropriate mix and it is leveled

384
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,710
off and we've got about an inch and a

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,659
half or two inches of space so that we

386
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,759
can add water or top dress later in the

387
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,639
future now in the very center of that

388
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,769
pot we need to create a space for our

389
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,058
transplanted plant we need to create a

390
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,938
little hole in with

391
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:26,158
to place our small root ball the way I

392
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:27,718
like to do it is find the middle that

393
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,849
topsoil and just dig out about a

394
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:31,319
fist-sized worth of dirt just take out

395
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:33,028
about just a fist I've got a pretty big

396
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:34,108
fist so just take out about a fist size

397
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:34,859
worth of dirt right in the center of

398
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:38,369
that topsoil

399
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:40,559
then whatever size pot my plant is

400
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:42,449
already in say I'm in a beer cup or

401
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:44,908
maybe I'm in a six-inch net pot I will

402
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:47,878
take a beer cup or a six-inch net pot

403
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:49,979
and I will dig a hole in my new pot soil

404
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,259
right at the top right in the center and

405
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:54,509
I will actually plant the cup in that

406
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,369
hole I will dig a hole perfectly to

407
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:59,219
where that cup will fit then it will

408
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:02,428
backfill dirt around that cup kind of

409
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:04,199
snug then I will pull the cup or the

410
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:06,958
six-inch net pot out of that main hole

411
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:09,688
now I have got a perfect template that

412
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,728
is the exact shape of the incoming root

413
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:13,948
ball from my small veg plant

414
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:16,859
so I basically leveled off the dirt I

415
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:19,048
dug out a hole I put the previous pot in

416
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:21,028
that hole I back filled it then I just

417
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:23,338
pulled that pot right out so I made an

418
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:25,918
impression a template just a little gap

419
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,509
for the next plant to fit perfectly into

420
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:29,728
so you've got a top layer of soil with

421
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,349
this little round hole perfectly waiting

422
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:34,439
just chill and wait for a pot to go in

423
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:37,709
it now our next step is to pot our small

424
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:38,698
veg plant into that hole but before we

425
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,188
do that you know what I'm gonna

426
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:43,528
recommend let's sprinkle a little mica

427
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:45,568
powder right into that hole our fresh

428
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:47,278
exposed roots are gonna go right there

429
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,958
let's just sprinkle some mica powder

430
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,938
right there let's just give it some love

431
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,798
give it a boost to give it a head start

432
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:54,718
that's just like laying out some cookies

433
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:56,428
for Santa just get it nice and ready put

434
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,119
some mica powder right in the hole now

435
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:01,918
our next challenge will be to get the

436
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:04,619
small plant out of that small pot

437
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:06,658
hopefully it is grown really tight into

438
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,939
your beer cup or really tight into your

439
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:10,979
six-inch net pot it is nicely rootbound

440
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:12,448
there's a lot of root mass in that

441
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:15,389
container so it's gonna take a little

442
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:19,198
effort to get it out the way I do it as

443
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,369
I make a Spock hand I've got my first

444
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,019
finger and my middle finger together

445
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:24,658
I've got my ring finger and my pinky

446
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,389
finger together I place the stick of the

447
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:29,989
plant between in between my middle

448
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:32,938
finger and my ring finger sticking up

449
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:34,769
the root ball the soil is in my palm

450
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:36,509
then I flip it upside

451
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,489
so now the plant is hanging upside down

452
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:41,100
and I'm holding on to the root ball with

453
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:42,629
my Spock hand I'll take my I do that in

454
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,739
my left hand cuz it did I don't need as

455
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,019
much coordination it could just stay

456
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:48,360
there then I take my right hand and I

457
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,428
kind of just squeeze the cup or the beer

458
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,558
or the beer cup or the six-inch net pot

459
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:53,399
just squeeze it all around just squeeze

460
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:55,110
it

461
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,428
if you've ever rolled a joint too tight

462
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,839
and you're trying to loosen the joint

463
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,119
it's the same idea we're just trying to

464
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,309
loosen the dirt out of that Cup so just

465
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,209
squeeze all around it just squeeze it

466
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,438
that's all you really got to do and

467
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,118
you'll feel it loosening up maybe

468
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,860
squeeze it and work it to the left and

469
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,329
right just a little bit you'll feel how

470
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,438
to loosen the dirt inside of that pot

471
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,758
once you start doing it all you're

472
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:13,678
trying to do is loosen the dirt so that

473
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,879
it will fall out give it a little shake

474
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,730
and it's gonna fall out you're gonna

475
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,489
have an exposed root zone in your hand

476
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,438
now it's okay hopefully when it came out

477
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,879
it all stayed together in one big chunk

478
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,678
hopefully you've taken good care of it

479
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,058
you've properly watered it you've given

480
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:29,009
it proper dry time and the roots have

481
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:31,110
developed nice and fat in there so it's

482
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:33,028
all just one chunk if it came out as a

483
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,798
mess that's okay we're just gonna pop

484
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:36,860
that whole mess into that hole that we

485
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:40,678
already made and it will be just fine

486
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,298
once you get the root ball out of the

487
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:44,999
container you already know what I'm

488
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:45,688
gonna say sprinkle a little mykos on it

489
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:48,058
why not

490
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:50,188
we've got exposed roots those roots love

491
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:51,958
mykos those mykos are activated by

492
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:54,058
touching roots sprinkle them on there

493
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,349
give it as much mica powder as you can

494
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:57,058
afford to sprinkle on there at this time

495
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,889
just give it a nice little coating just

496
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:02,999
infect it with root inoculant powder

497
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:04,949
then we want to if it came out in a mess

498
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,110
you need to gently place it in that hole

499
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,568
get as much of that original dirt as you

500
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,609
can in there set the root ball down put

501
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:13,769
some so maybe put the if there are

502
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,359
dangling long roots set the dangling

503
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:17,068
roots in there put a little dirt on top

504
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,838
of it lower the plant in a little more

505
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:20,578
put some dirt on top of it lower it in a

506
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,109
little bit more so that you don't bind

507
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,668
those roots up we're trying to give

508
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,979
those roots space we don't want to just

509
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,329
drop them right in there and smother

510
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,038
them with fresh dirt so if they came

511
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:31,259
apart keep them apart when you're

512
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,460
putting them in there then backfill it

513
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,619
with all the dirt from that container

514
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,990
and you should have enough dirt there to

515
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,879
level everything off if you lost some

516
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,528
dirt during the movement just grab some

517
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,570
more dirt out of your mix and just top

518
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,429
it or you have a nice even layer kind of

519
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:46,109
pack it in not super tight just tight

520
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,360
enough to keep that plant staying

521
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:50,729
straight upright now if it came

522
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,339
nice and smooth now we've got another

523
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,039
option if it came out nice and smooth

524
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,959
and you feel like those routes are

525
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,639
perfect and they aren't super bound but

526
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,980
they're growing well you can just set

527
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,320
still sprinkle some Aiko's on it then

528
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,329
you can set that perfect root ball right

529
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,829
into that perfect hole maybe sprinkle a

530
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:09,659
little bit of dirt on top of it and Pat

531
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,490
it in and you've got a beautifully

532
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,920
transplanted plant that didn't get any

533
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,170
shock or any stress whatsoever during

534
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,360
the transplanting process our other

535
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,640
option when you take it out of the small

536
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,469
container if it is really bound up in

537
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,780
there if you see a lot of white roots

538
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,850
and it is growing in a circle and it's

539
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,639
getting spiraled you do have the option

540
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:31,589
to kind of break those roots up just a

541
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,480
little bit the way I do it is I hold it

542
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,009
with my left hand and I take my middle

543
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,990
finger and my ring finger on my right

544
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,269
hand and I come straight up from the

545
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,829
bottom of that root ball and I just plow

546
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:42,569
my fingers through it and just pull it

547
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,308
apart just spread it right in half

548
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,470
you're gonna tear some roots up you're

549
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:48,418
gonna mess some stuff up if you've got a

550
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,279
nice healthy root system that is only

551
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,290
going to encourage growth you're

552
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,819
spreading it out a little bit then when

553
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:55,500
you set it in that template hole that

554
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:57,029
you've got the roots will spread out a

555
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,859
little bit and instead of drawing in a

556
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,109
perfect spiral they're gonna take off a

557
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,279
little bit for you and fill that pot so

558
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,649
either way

559
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,759
sprinkle mykos on the roots on that root

560
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,190
ball that you pull out of the pot

561
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,650
sprinkle mykos on there always sprinkle

562
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,870
some Aiko's into the hole then gently

563
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,790
place that small root ball into that

564
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:17,189
fresh hole and just cover it with dirt

565
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:18,960
gently again don't pack it down too

566
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,519
tightly but pack it down tight enough

567
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,230
toward you know it's not gonna cave in

568
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,940
when we water it and that it's tight

569
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,460
enough to give that plant enough support

570
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,470
to stay upright you will know on the

571
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,450
first watering if you did not do it

572
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,769
tightly enough if you didn't do it tight

573
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,890
enough you're just gonna need to add

574
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,379
more medium now that plant is basically

575
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,230
transplanted I recommend you label that

576
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,179
plant at this time before you forget the

577
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,308
next step is to move that plant under

578
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,650
the appropriate light I should also

579
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,298
mention you may need a saucer or some

580
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,919
sort of a catch tray underneath your

581
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,019
plants when we water these plants we

582
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,730
expect to have some runoff so now is a

583
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,039
good time to consider placing your plant

584
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,230
on a saucer or some sort of a catch tray

585
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,879
so we've got the trays down let's talk

586
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,059
about the lighting in which we are going

587
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,920
to place these plants under

588
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:06,049
you can use T fives for your fresh

589
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,900
transplants you can get the T fives

590
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:11,059
really close you can get those t5 lights

591
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,190
three maybe four inches away from your

592
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,109
canopy just make sure that you adjust

593
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,850
them every day because the plants are

594
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:18,500
going to grow rapidly and they will grow

595
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:21,529
into those lights if you don't pay

596
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,720
attention you can also use ceramic metal

597
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:26,480
halide for your fresh transplants I like

598
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,490
the 315 s or the 630 s you need to keep

599
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,410
those a little bit further away than the

600
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:34,789
t5 is probably about a foot maybe 18

601
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:37,880
inches away LEDs are very brand and

602
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:40,279
power specific I would follow the

603
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,320
recommendation from the manufacturer on

604
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,990
your LED I don't have enough experience

605
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,490
with your LED to know what it's going to

606
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,319
do to the plants there are so many

607
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,720
vendors so many different makes and

608
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,299
models that it is hard to give advice

609
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,420
for LED lighting but you certainly can

610
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,099
use LEDs through the entire cycle and

611
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,620
you can absolutely use them right now

612
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,990
for your fresh transplants you can also

613
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:05,209
use metal halide or high pressure sodium

614
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,700
also known as high-intensity discharge

615
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,710
lighting if you are going to use

616
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,539
high-intensity discharge lighting pay

617
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,360
close attention to how the plants are

618
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,909
reacting if you're using a 400 you can

619
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,219
probably get 12 to 18 inches away and

620
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,920
not have any problems if you were using

621
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,110
a 600 you could probably get 18 inches

622
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,210
away and not have any problems if you're

623
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:28,129
using a thousand watt light you may want

624
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,160
to start off about two feet away from

625
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,500
the canopy maybe even more as you start

626
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,509
introducing these plants to that larger

627
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,640
light as time goes on you can get closer

628
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,740
they will grow closer to the light but

629
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,930
when you were introducing young plants

630
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,849
to large lights pay attention to how

631
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,470
they react we don't want to burn these

632
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,639
lights we don't want to stress them I

633
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,049
said lights we don't want to burn the

634
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,220
plants we don't want to stress the

635
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,259
plants we don't want to put them into

636
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,059
any kind of shock right as we transplant

637
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,559
them this is a critical time we were

638
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,419
trying to put them into turbo mode right

639
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,470
now we don't want to slow them down we

640
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,090
don't want to punish them and put them

641
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,860
on timeout we want to give them

642
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:02,899
encouragement to take off right now so

643
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:04,429
we have our plants under the appropriate

644
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,110
light we've got our light the

645
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,450
appropriate distance away from our

646
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,969
canopy let's talk about the amount of

647
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,799
light hours we are going to give these

648
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,170
plants I've talked earlier about

649
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,950
lighting schedules and apparently in a

650
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,259
previous episode

651
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,269
I did make a mistake at some point I

652
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:21,799
said something about eighteen on and

653
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:23,720
sixteen off or something like that

654
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,269
somebody said your light cycle will

655
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,519
always add up to 24 hours if my light

656
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,099
cycle I said didn't add up to 24 hours I

657
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,039
was too high to be doing a podcast and I

658
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,509
do apologize honestly when you talk as

659
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,940
much as I do I think you're gonna make a

660
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:39,829
few mistakes and I encourage you guys to

661
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,059
let me know when I make a mistake so

662
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,189
that I can't correct it and I do

663
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,799
apologize somebody said I did make a

664
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,289
light cycle mistake I apologize for that

665
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:51,440
allow me to correct myself in this part

666
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:54,529
there are several cycles that work very

667
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,380
well for our veg plants one common cycle

668
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:59,930
is 24 hours on and zero hours off I

669
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,120
mainly recommend this if you have mother

670
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,060
plants that tend to auto flower on you

671
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:07,849
or when you were cutting clones our next

672
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,129
option is 20 hours on and four hours off

673
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:12,559
I like to give the plants a few hours to

674
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,630
sleep this also gives my equipment four

675
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,539
hours to rest when you're running a

676
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,850
bedroom with 25 lights that is a hundred

677
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,500
hours of lights that you don't have to

678
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:23,299
run that's a lot of electricity that you

679
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,759
save you're also not paying for as much

680
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:28,849
cooling and humidity control it makes a

681
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,129
big difference so the 20 on and 4 off is

682
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,869
good for your equipment also the plants

683
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,510
get to take a nap who doesn't want to

684
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,549
take a nap I feel like the roots do a

685
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,500
lot of activity and the dark cycle I

686
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,899
feel like the plants grow a lot in the

687
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,319
dark cycle sugars are processed in the

688
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,570
dark cycle so 20 on 4 off is great that

689
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,909
will make any plants that may want to

690
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:52,099
Otto flower and a lesser cycle that will

691
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,290
prevent them from auto flowering and it

692
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,909
will also give you maximum growth and

693
00:23:54,289 --> 00:24:01,519
will keep your mother plants really

694
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:03,350
happy another very common veg 6 off this

695
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,319
is very common because it very closely

696
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:06,919
mimics the outdoor cycle of the natural

697
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,389
light

698
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:13,640
another option is 16 on and 8 off this

699
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,680
is very similar to outdoors as well the

700
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,640
reason people will adjust between the 16

701
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,920
and 8 and the 18 and 6 is because some

702
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,220
plants will try to flower on their own

703
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,500
with the 16 hours of daylight once they

704
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,720
get large enough and once they get root

705
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,599
bound also I feel like morale I

706
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,450
is more energy light is the number-one

707
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:38,839
desired source of energy and nutrient

708
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,400
for our plants so why not maximize the

709
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,559
light input of course some plants will

710
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,360
only take so much light per day and

711
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,250
they'll just shut themselves down but I

712
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,349
don't think you're going to overload

713
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,869
them with light in a small grow room

714
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:53,629
with a grow light so again our options

715
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:55,429
are 24 hours on and 0 hours off I

716
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,070
wouldn't really recommend that for these

717
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,470
large batch plants the next option is 20

718
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:02,119
hours on and four hours off in a

719
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,910
commercial environment that is what I

720
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,549
would do in another environment you can

721
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,269
go 18 on and 6 off that is very

722
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,720
acceptable

723
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:14,059
another option is 16 on and 8 off that

724
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,029
is very acceptable another thing I found

725
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:20,089
advantageous of the 20 on and 4 off is

726
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:22,369
when I do induce that 1212 flowering

727
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:25,009
cycle those plants really notice a

728
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:27,529
change in photo period and they really

729
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:29,180
go into flower really quickly so that's

730
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,539
something that I found has helped quite

731
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,910
a bit

732
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:34,309
any of those light cycles will work for

733
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,490
your veg plants find what works best for

734
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,049
you you will find pros and cons to each

735
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,930
of those options based on your

736
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:44,149
environment your location your setup and

737
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,920
your overall grow you're going to have

738
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,019
to find things through trial and error

739
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,779
when it comes to growing try some things

740
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,400
out see what works best for you and your

741
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,889
plants ultimately it's going to come

742
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,890
down to what works best for your plants

743
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,050
they are the boss alright at this point

744
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,720
our small veg plants have been up potted

745
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:04,490
they are now large veg plants we've got

746
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,319
them in there forever pots we've got

747
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,509
them underneath a good light we have got

748
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,819
that light on a solid schedule we've got

749
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:13,099
our pots sitting on a saucer or some

750
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,769
sort of a catch tray it is now time to

751
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:18,139
water our new transplants

752
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,839
I recommend feeding these transplants

753
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,640
with a strong vegetative nutrient if

754
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,619
you've got a bottle that says veg that's

755
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,259
the one you need right now you need

756
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:29,419
something with a good NPK ratio you need

757
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:32,809
more n then you do P and K you need a

758
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,029
high end ratio for this time also I

759
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:36,829
would recommend a myco product if you

760
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:39,230
haven't put plenty of powdered mykos in

761
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:41,329
there I recommend a micro Raizel fungal

762
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,548
product that is in liquid form that you

763
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:46,908
can feed right in your nutrient solution

764
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:49,009
now mix that in also a small dash of

765
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:51,499
carbs a little bit of carbohydrates will

766
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:53,450
help feed those mykos also it will give

767
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:55,730
the plants a little bit of energy

768
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,379
I also recommend a little bit of cal-mag

769
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,269
at this time the plants are big enough

770
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:01,488
to take cal-mag give them a little bit

771
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:03,710
of a boost I would also recommend a

772
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:05,509
little bit of enzymes at this time that

773
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,489
will speed everything up it'll help keep

774
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,839
the root zone nice and clean the micro

775
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:10,278
products and the enzymes will work

776
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,209
together they will make a happy

777
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,429
rhizosphere

778
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,038
your plants will thrive you may also

779
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,778
want to add a little bit of potassium

780
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:20,269
silicates at this time

781
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:22,429
potassium silicates make for robust

782
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:24,048
plants and it will also help with any

783
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,269
stress if you have any environmental

784
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:28,009
stressors that potassium silicon will

785
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,929
make the plants just a little more

786
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:32,028
resilient and a little tougher for the

787
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,159
mistakes that you may make now I

788
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:37,519
recommend you adjust the pH of your feed

789
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,129
solution to somewhere between 6 to + 6 4

790
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,349
if we were in cocoa in a commercial

791
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:45,288
facility I would tell the guys to adjust

792
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:47,358
the pH to 6 3 if we were in a soilless

793
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:51,079
mix in a commercial facility I would

794
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:53,239
tell them to go 6 3 - 6 4 so it makes up

795
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,009
your nutrient solution put your pH meter

796
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,929
in there see what the value is and

797
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:59,720
adjust up or down as necessary

798
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,879
write that down then water the plants

799
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,100
with that solution since we're talking

800
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:06,398
about watering plants I highly recommend

801
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:09,199
you go back and take a listen to episode

802
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,748
337 which is titled one through five

803
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,090
watering tech one through five watering

804
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:15,950
tech will help all growers if you're a

805
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:17,839
new grower if you're an experienced

806
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,639
grower if you're a professional grower

807
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,128
you will learn something from the one

808
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:24,288
through five water tech episode if you

809
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:26,329
are an experienced grower and you're

810
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,908
trying to teach a new grower how to

811
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:31,939
water your garden one through five water

812
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:34,809
tech is a great training exercise so I

813
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,159
recommend everybody listen to episode

814
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:39,769
337 and learn about one through five

815
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,899
watering tech now before you water your

816
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:43,999
plants we talked about the pH I did not

817
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:46,699
talk about the temperature of the water

818
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:48,589
it's winter time in Colorado and it is

819
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,330
really cold if you're pulling water

820
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:52,368
right out of the tap it's coming out of

821
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:54,829
the tap way too cold to apply to the

822
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:57,169
plants we need the water that we feed

823
00:28:54,829 --> 00:29:00,679
our plants to be right around seven

824
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:03,320
degrees maybe 65 would be acceptable but

825
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,240
I wouldn't go much lower than 65 imagine

826
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,309
sticking your feet and some 65 degree

827
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,019
water first thing in the morning that's

828
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,419
what it's like when you water the plants

829
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:13,430
with 65 degree water so I wouldn't go

830
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,430
any lower than 65 I would stay closer to

831
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,710
70 maybe up in the 75 not much warmer

832
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,900
than that right around 70 degrees is

833
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,910
just about ideal for watering the plants

834
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,410
in a home grow you can always just turn

835
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,600
the hot water on as you're filling up

836
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,820
your container in some environments we

837
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,099
don't have the option for hot water if

838
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:32,990
your water is coming out too cold you

839
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:35,359
can either get a bucket heater from your

840
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,009
local tractor or farm supply store they

841
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,569
just sell bucket heaters they also saw

842
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:40,190
them at the farm supply store for

843
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:41,659
troughs so that you can warm up the pig

844
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,000
and horse water so they don't have to

845
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,740
drink ice water in the morning or if a

846
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,420
bucket heater is not an option for you

847
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,039
you can always fill up containers of

848
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,750
water you can take them into the

849
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,789
flowering rooms or the bedrooms of the

850
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,319
day before and let that light and that

851
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:56,599
grow room environment warm up the water

852
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,569
for you of course that's only if you

853
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,459
remember to do that the day before so my

854
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:03,139
point is don't feed the plants water

855
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,440
that is really cold we want that water

856
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,509
to be right around 70 degrees now in

857
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,460
this first watering make sure you really

858
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:12,140
saturate the medium make sure you have

859
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,329
plenty of water coming out of those

860
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,210
drainage holes we want to make sure to

861
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:19,069
soak every spot of the container we

862
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,890
don't want a dry spot because roots will

863
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,990
not grow into dry areas nutrients aren't

864
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,180
getting into those dry areas so make

865
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,370
sure you fully saturate the pot I like

866
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:30,410
to soak it every time I water but it's

867
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,539
mostly important this very first time

868
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,180
water it till you get a lot of water

869
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,279
coming out of those holes also don't

870
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,470
leave the plant ever standing in

871
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,149
stagnant water if that water in the

872
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,400
bottom of your trailer doesn't evaporate

873
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,970
or get sucked up by that plant within a

874
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,100
few hours

875
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,110
get a shot back and suck that out of

876
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:50,059
there all right so now our plants are

877
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:51,859
all successfully transplanted they have

878
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,359
now been fed their big-kid nutrients

879
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:54,919
let's talk a little bit about the

880
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,329
environment in which to keep these

881
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,190
plants we know where to keep the lights

882
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:01,129
we know what cycled I have the lights on

883
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,840
let's talk about the temperature during

884
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,380
the day I try to keep the temperature

885
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:09,919
between 70 and 80 degrees then I try to

886
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,030
keep the night around 65 to 75 I really

887
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,610
try to have no

888
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:15,889
more than a 10 degree swing in my

889
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:18,529
temperature between day and night

890
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:21,410
meaning if it's 70 during the day I want

891
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:23,210
it no lower than 60 during the night I

892
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,950
honestly try to keep about 5 to 7

893
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,779
degrees in that swing I know it's

894
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,190
difficult on a home grow sometimes we

895
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,809
don't have the appropriate equipment to

896
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,970
monitor and/or adjust things all the

897
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:34,069
time but do your best to keep it within

898
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,620
a 10 degree differential between night

899
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:38,689
and day now at this point in the large

900
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:42,259
veg phase I try to keep the humidity

901
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,180
between 40 and 60% right around 50 is

902
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:46,339
ideal if you want to understand more

903
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,620
about why I keep the humidity and the

904
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:51,079
temperature the way I do I recommend you

905
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:53,149
check out episode 314 and it's called

906
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,730
vapor pressure deficit and you can learn

907
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,410
about VPD and why it's important to keep

908
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,440
the temperature and humidity in the

909
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,540
appropriate range for our plants another

910
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,509
thing I like to add to our large veg is

911
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:07,339
a fan I like to have wall fans or those

912
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,629
fans on stands depending on your setup

913
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:10,879
but I like to have a fan just

914
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,060
oscillating in the room circulating the

915
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,100
air

916
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,960
the idea is to circulate the air I want

917
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,669
to move the stale air around and move

918
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,710
that fresh air around so the plants have

919
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,090
fresh air constantly you don't need to

920
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,100
beat the [ __ ] out of the plants with a

921
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:23,869
fan I go in some groves and they're just

922
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:25,730
terrorizing plants with fans and just

923
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:27,589
beating them to death and wondering why

924
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,089
the plants look like [ __ ] we just want

925
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:31,099
to rustle the leaves we just want to

926
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:33,589
move the air around so I like to put a

927
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,269
fan about one fan every one or two

928
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:36,889
lights depending on the size of the room

929
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,900
and the environment but make sure that

930
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,540
every area is getting fresh air in that

931
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,810
room at this point I feel like we have

932
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:47,480
officially entered the large veg phase

933
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:49,879
our main goals in focus now are to keep

934
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,490
the plants pests and pathogens free we

935
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,340
need to avoid nutrient and pH mistakes

936
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,589
make sure not to over feed our plants at

937
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:00,980
this time also pay very close attention

938
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:02,359
to the pH of your feeding solutions we

939
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,069
need to keep these plants healthy and

940
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,899
vigorous we need to work on the top part

941
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,759
of the plants now we focus on the bottom

942
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,490
for the first half now we're gonna focus

943
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,470
more on the top half that means in the

944
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,569
upcoming episodes we're going to work on

945
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,339
shaping and structuring these plants

946
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,929
we're also going to talk about popping

947
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,720
and twisting then we'll talk about

948
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,910
bottoming and topping and lolli popping

949
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,920
our plants but that is all in upcoming

950
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,450
episodes I've got two quick

951
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,130
to cover before we start wrapping up

952
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,930
this episode and then we are out of here

953
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,780
for this week you guys one thing I

954
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,789
should talk about is pest management now

955
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:38,180
is a good time if you are going to apply

956
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:42,289
pesticide sprays today is a good day to

957
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,940
start that IPM program those plants are

958
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,889
moving into the bedroom they're in their

959
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,620
big pots let's go ahead and hit them

960
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,840
with a light pesticide spray turn off

961
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,639
the lights douse the plants give them a

962
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,169
couple hours to dry off turn the lights

963
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,790
back on to their regularly scheduled

964
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,590
program and pay attention to those

965
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,899
plants see how they react

966
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:01,309
hopefully you wrote down exactly what

967
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,110
you sprayed on those plants you wrote

968
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:05,179
down the product and you wrote how much

969
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,829
per gallon you applied you wrote down

970
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,539
what time you applied it and now you

971
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:10,250
have a good frame of reference so you

972
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:12,739
can go in and look you can see how the

973
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,750
plants reacted if they look angry you

974
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,428
need to reduce the application next time

975
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,320
if they look happy about it you can do

976
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,410
the same thing or consider increasing

977
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,380
the application rate if necessary so I

978
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,579
generally start my heavy pest management

979
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,690
application right when I move them into

980
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,639
the large pots

981
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,400
another thing that will be important to

982
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,319
think about is flip time how long are

983
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,470
these plants going to veg in this

984
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,090
environment how much space do you have

985
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:39,859
depending on your genetics depending on

986
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,559
your lighting depending on your overall

987
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,230
environment these plants could double in

988
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:48,168
size if you were working within a rise

989
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,210
cross there is a good likelihood that by

990
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,429
the time you finish that plant it will

991
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,800
be twice the size it was when you

992
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,019
started the flowering process so if that

993
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,000
plant is 24 inches tall when you induce

994
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,909
flowering there's a good chance that

995
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,340
plant will end up 48 inches tall before

996
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:05,960
it is done so as a grower you need to

997
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,120
plan ahead you need to make sure that

998
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,980
plant does not grow up into your lights

999
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,539
and burn itself you need to save

1000
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,039
depending on the type of light you're

1001
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:16,039
using you need to save some space

1002
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,380
between the bulb and your top Cola so

1003
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,789
plan ahead now is the time to start

1004
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,220
thinking about how long we're going to

1005
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:24,739
veg if you veg to long the plants will

1006
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:26,629
get too tall you'll have problems we're

1007
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,609
also going to do things like topping and

1008
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,289
bottoming and Lolly popping and twisting

1009
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,390
and cracking and trellising and

1010
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:33,739
manipulating these plants so we're going

1011
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:35,239
to need to give them a little bit of

1012
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:37,219
time to recover from some of these

1013
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,629
techniques before we initiate the

1014
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,969
flowering process

1015
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:44,059
so if we plan ahead and know how long we

1016
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:46,369
anticipate to veg we can predict when to

1017
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:49,039
do these steps to increase production

1018
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,809
and flour at the ideal time and fill our

1019
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,179
grow space perfectly we can end up with

1020
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:54,619
our canopy right about eight inches

1021
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:56,210
below that light and it'll be nice and

1022
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,579
even and look beautiful you won't have

1023
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,470
any wasted space in there once you're an

1024
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:03,019
experienced grower your goal will be to

1025
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:06,199
fill your grow space if you've got a 5

1026
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,759
by 5 grow tent you want a 5 by 5 canopy

1027
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,319
or at least a four and a half by four

1028
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,880
and a half canopy because when it when

1029
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,860
the air flows it sucks in a little bit

1030
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,410
but you want to fill most of that space

1031
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,809
a very experienced grower an older guy

1032
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:19,250
he said one day if you had a cooler and

1033
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,570
you could fill it with beer would you

1034
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,929
fill it most of the way to the top with

1035
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,309
beer

1036
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,960
or would you fill that cooler all the

1037
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,579
way with beer I'm not even a beer

1038
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,139
drinker and that makes sense to me I

1039
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,000
want as many beers fit in that cooler

1040
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,589
that's just the way you do it so do you

1041
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,179
want your grow room to be halfway filled

1042
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,640
with buds or do you want to fill that

1043
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:37,579
[ __ ] up with buds the goal will be to

1044
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,469
maximize that canopy space so in future

1045
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:41,750
episodes we will talk about trellising

1046
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:43,609
lolli popping will talk about sticks and

1047
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,409
cages and cracking stems we will go in

1048
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,840
depth and a lot of techniques like that

1049
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:49,819
on ways to fill up your cooler for

1050
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,950
maximum production all right podcast
