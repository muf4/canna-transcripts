podcast off by letting you know what I

45
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,000
am smoking on I feel like I've smoked a

46
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,880
little bit of everything over the past

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,969
weekend I smoked flowers I smoked dabs I

48
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,949
smoked a joint with dabs inside of it I

49
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,478
smoked every kind of concentrate I could

50
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,299
imagine I think you might be able to

51
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,829
hear it in my voice but it was great it

52
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,270
was worth it but today let's talk about

53
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,700
what I've got in my hand right now I've

54
00:01:55,269 --> 00:02:00,759
got some white lightning number seven

55
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,969
sauce from our friends at olio

56
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,540
it is olio sauce I'm cracking it open it

57
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:08,318
smells like banana runts

58
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,879
like the banana

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,378
shaped candies that you get out of the

60
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,989
little quarter thing at the bowling

61
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:15,908
alley or wherever you get them it smells

62
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,789
like banana runts with another sweetness

63
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:20,649
on top of it maybe maybe a hint of lemon

64
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:23,199
maybe on top of the banana run too

65
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,938
lemony banana run this concentrate it's

66
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,699
going quickly there's one good crystal

67
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:30,968
left in here once again with olio I

68
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:33,188
really appreciated the amount of sauce

69
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,870
which is the Terps to Crystal's which is

70
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:36,968
the high cannabinoid full-spectrum

71
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,908
extract the ratio was beautiful

72
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:41,530
about 30 percent Terps 70 percent chunks

73
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:42,759
it's really easy to dab that way it's

74
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,049
not a pain in the ass to get on the

75
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,120
dabber I don't feel like I'm wasting a

76
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,669
lot of the juice great concentrate from

77
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,930
our friends at olio I highly recommend

78
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:53,739
that the white lightning number 7 sauce

79
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,870
delicious kind of tastes like banana

80
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,099
runts if you're into banana that's a

81
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,919
good thing if you're not into banana

82
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:01,598
this might not be the thing for you

83
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,879

growers grow flowers their pot and they

109
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,540
entered their pot into this Cup and then

110
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:03,489
a bunch of folks were invited myself and

111
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,870
a lot of other people I don't have a

112
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,859
good head count on how many people were

113
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,560
in there it was at a place called

114
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,209
cultivated synergy and it was perfectly

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,218
crowded it was crowded enough to look

116
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,120
like a big crowd but not so overcrowded

117
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,029
that you were shoulder-to-shoulder

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,278
bumping into people but anyway a bunch

119
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,988
of people came everybody that grew their

120
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:21,909
product came there were at least 30

121
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,619
maybe 40 entries so the way

122
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,360
work these people grew their product and

123
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,030
they entered them they turned them in in

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,939
a jar and then these jars were all wind

125
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:32,439
up across a I would call it a bud bar in

126
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,990
one section of the building the back

127
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,660
wall of the building just had a long bud

128
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,850
bar setup and there were bud tenders

129
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,200
behind that bar packing bulls for you so

130
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,180
if you walked up and you said hey can I

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,860
try sample number one the person behind

132
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,420
that bud bar would pack up a bowl of

133
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,530
sample number one for him just a small

134
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,330
one II Bowl they're a bunch of fresh

135
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,279
pipes laying around and people had pipes

136
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:52,719
for days so you just walk up and say hey

137
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,519
can I get a fresh sample of number one

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,990
they'd pack up number one for you take a

139
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,120
little hit of it see what you think of

140
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,500
it blow it out and get back in line and

141
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,850
go try sample number two and then get

142
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,649
back in line and do sample number three

143
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,900
and just work your way down the table

144
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,669
and there were 30 to 40 samples so if

145
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,870
you wanted to smoke all of them you were

146
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,100
gonna be there for a little while cuz

147
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,569
you had to stand in line between each

148
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
one and also you want to take a second

149
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,189
between each puff you don't want a smoke

150
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,840
example one smoke sample do how you

151
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,089
gonna tell what happened sample two is

152
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,709
gonna be the only one you notice maybe

153
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,909
maybe sample one's all you noticed but

154
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,989
you didn't know two sample - see what

155
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,670
I'm saying you can't do it that way so

156
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,319
you gotta take a minute anyway so they

157
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,420
were all lined up people were you take a

158
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,399
smoke then once you smoke all of the

159
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,500
samples you want to try then it was time

160
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,839
to vote and they gave us tokens that

161
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,129
said the dude grows Cup on them and they

162
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,779
were just little wood tokens and he

163
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,909
would place those in the corresponding

164
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,409

called themselves bin ski and I've

226
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,030
actually heard a lot about Ben ski going

227
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,439
around the industry lately that is a

228
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,448
name that people are saying so shout out

229
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,418

the flower competition at the dude grows

231
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:56,240
Cup so let's talk about the couple

232
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,829
little that I told you what it was I

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,189
told you who won I told you how it

234
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,168
worked

235
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,000
people grew flowers they entered flowers

236
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:04,218
we smoked flowers we voted they

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,889
announced a winner that's basically how

238
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:08,750
a cup should go it went smoothly in that

239
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,740
aspect without a hitch nothing went

240
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,990
wrong in my opinion

241
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,879
I got super lucky and found a really

242
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,408
nice parking space otherwise that could

243
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,269
have been kind of a pain in the ass is

244
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:18,740
that a lot of stuff to carry but nothing

245
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,879
went really wrong nothing was poorly

246
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,418
planned this year I think everything

247
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,038
went fairly well so and I had a great

248
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:27,799
time one of my favorite parts about it

249
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,360
is there were two or three different

250
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,829
podcasts there of course it is a dude

251
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,050
gross event it's hosted by the dude

252
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:34,668
gross they invite me the girl from your

253
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,218
heart podcast I go up there and hang out

254
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:38,870
and then also I met a couple other folks

255
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,729
that have podcast shout out you guys

256
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,019
I honestly I'm gonna forget a lot of

257
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,579
people that I want to give shout outs to

258
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,019
because I got super lit and I had a

259
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,549
super good time and I didn't write down

260
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,949
names and [ __ ] but I'll try to do my

261
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,569
best to remember but

262
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,670
ah my favorite part is that all these

263
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,290
people get together all these podcasters

264
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:55,329
come together and we just all hang out I

265
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:57,099
get to meet people that listen to the

266
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,110
dude grow show I get to people listen to

267
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,029
meet people that listen to my show I get

268
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,710
to meet people that found the dude show

269
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,839
through my show and people that found my

270
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,100
show through the dude show it's just

271
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,960
such a good time to get the community

272
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,350
together people that message me on

273
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,910
social media and on through email and

274
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,800
however they contact me mostly social

275
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:16,089
media right I get to meet them and

276
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,500
actually shake their hand and give them

277
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,060
too big of a dab and watch them turn

278
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,350
pale and try not to fall over because

279
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,789
they're not from Colorado they don't get

280
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,009
to dab like that and I'm spoiled and I

281
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:26,349
like to spoil them so that's what I love

282
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,840
about it it's such a good time cuz we

283
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,750
get people from all over the country and

284
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,330
a lot of the events are a bunch of

285
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,279
younger kids and it's uh the music's too

286
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,370
loud and it's just it's a little

287
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,230
obnoxious and it's mostly like a like a

288
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,820
trade show like an RV show everyone's

289
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,409
just trying to sell [ __ ] and their way

290
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,780
of selling you [ __ ] is by having hot

291
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:48,850
girls and loud music that doesn't happen

292
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,230
at the dude bros cup there are plenty of

293
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,610
beautiful ladies there but they are not

294
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,039
vending anything they're just they're

295
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,930
hanging out smoking dad's there they're

296
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,849
part of the crew they're not there for

297
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,219
advertising the music is at a very

298
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,050
acceptable level I don't have a headache

299
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,420
my throat's only burnt out because I

300
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:05,949
chose to talk way too much I never

301
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,319
stopped talking I met so many cool

302
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,300
people and a lot of the other events the

303
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,280
music's so loud that when I come home I

304
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,319
throat hurts the music is at a great

305
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,789
level this is a little bit of an older

306
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,920
crowd it's not the super young crowd

307
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,319
it's the next level up so I kind of

308
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,759
enjoyed that aspect of it it's super

309
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,620
comfortable I don't have any worries

310
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,600
leaving my backpack sitting on the table

311
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,889
and turning my head a few times I don't

312
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,750
feel like someone's gonna rob me I

313
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,240
really like that so it's a great event

314
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,889
the venue is awesome cultivated synergy

315
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,840

318
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,720
the event I got to meet a lot of my

319
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,949
friends I got to meet so one of our

320
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,250

321
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,900
snowstorm east of here right before the

322
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,879

325
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,860
snowed in and had to post pictures of

326

we need to write hi my name is and you

527
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,789
need to put your real name and your

528
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,740
Instagram name on there because first

529
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,629
owners and everybody's got to [ __ ]

530
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,660
names they gets to be a lot to remember

531
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,300
like I was talking to a friend on my

532
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,890
Instagram live video and I didn't even

533
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,109
realize who I was talking to because I

534
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,610
was like what's up Instagram handles 710

535
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,869
for 25000

536
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,369
and I'm just talking to him like he's

537
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,599
some random dude like he's asking

538
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,709
questions and I was just like kind of

539
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,329
being kind of vague cuz what he was

540
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,009
asking was I should be vague about that

541
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:52,689
if I didn't know the guy and so

542
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,190
eventually he's like hey you know that

543
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,390
it's me right and he told me his real

544
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,680
name and I was like oh [ __ ]

545
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,540
dude I didn't realize that was you

546
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,460
because it's hard to keep up with all

547
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,720
the Instagram names and real names so

548
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,730
that's one thing that I would add those

549
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,319
little hi my name is I would have those

550
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,700
tags with your real name and then your

551
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,619
Instagram name or whatever you're known

552
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,900
as or whatever your company is so mine

553
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:12,189
would say hi I'm Rasta Jeff and I region

554
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,420
etic so that people would be like that

555
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,250
is Rasta Jeff just so there's no

556
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,660
question just so you guys can't say I

557
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,099

558

564
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,039
quick thing I want to talk about before

565
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:31,240
I start wrapping up this podcast let me

566
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,279
find this little screen shot that I took

567
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,170
I thought this was entertaining I work

568
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,509
for a Colorado marijuana Enforcement

569
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:41,110
Division regulated business and let's

570
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:43,720
see who published this document the the

571
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:46,919
Med yes the Colorado marijuana

572
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,450
Enforcement Division has passed out a

573
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,860
big criminal enforcement division from

574
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,269
the Department of Revenue and where this

575
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,089
came from which is a part of the

576
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:57,940
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

577
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:00,429
they pass out a paper that says 4/20

578
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,769
reminders and it says 4/20 reminders in

579
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,840
the middle and then it's like a bubble a

580
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,129
bubble a cluster chart I don't remember

581
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,449
what they call these like when you're

582
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,370
supposed to get ideas in school and you

583
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,630
make a circle and you write podcast and

584
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,369
you make notes coming off it you make

585
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,870
another circle and it says talk about

586
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:15,789
weed another circle comes off and it

587
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:17,199
says talk about education but they made

588
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,480
one of these in the middle of says

589
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,190
reminders and I'm gonna read you guys

590
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,410
the reminders that they have issued to

591
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,509
the dispensaries the top one says no

592
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,259
sales to non patients and persons under

593
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:31,569
21 years of age most vertical IDs equal

594
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:33,279
under 21 so what that means is no sales

595
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,019
to non patients if you're a medical

596
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,779
marijuana dispensary you cannot sell

597
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,549
sell to anybody who is not a registered

598
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,430
patient with a current active card and

599
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:45,519
valid ID um and persons under the age of

600
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,230
21 if you are a recreational store you

601
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,299
were able to sell to anyone with a 21

602
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,799
and up ID if they're not 21 and up you

603
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,250
cannot sell to them they also give you a

604
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,168
hint most vertical IDs equal under 21 so

605
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,148
if you've got a vertical ID the

606
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,489
was the long way that probably means

607
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:01,898
that you are a minor you are not buying

608
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,399
cannabis all right

609
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,349
there's another bubble and it says no

610
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:07,538
public consumption it is violation of

611
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:09,308
state and local laws and person could be

612
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:11,440
subject to criminal charges so they're

613
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:14,288
just reminding you for 4/20 to remind

614
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,179
your customers no public consumption the

615
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:18,669
next one says visitors and limited

616
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:21,159
access areas visitors must be escorted

617
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:23,019
by employee five per employee which I

618
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,570
thought was four so that's an increase

619
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,940
um if you're going to take people that

620
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:29,678
are not badged and not employees into a

621
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,288
cultivation facility they must be

622
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,669
escorted by a key badged employee you

623
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:35,349
must have a key badge you can't have a

624
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,749
support badge if they have a key badge

625
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:39,339
or an owner badge and you have to escort

626
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:41,288
those people through the facility and

627
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,329
you cannot do more than five people at

628
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:44,888
one time so if you're gonna bring a band

629
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,388
through if you're gonna bring fortunate

630
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:47,439
youth loves to go through grows I think

631
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:49,418
there's like five or six of them you

632
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,710
could bring five of them per person so

633
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,149
you gotta have two people to have the

634
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,700
full band going through there probably

635
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:56,319
to escort them if a rapper comes through

636
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,899
if Wiz Khalifa comes through by himself

637
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,638
one person can escort Wiz just

638
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:02,498
one-on-one but you have to have one

639
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:05,349
person for every five visitors that one

640
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,249
person has to be a key badge you guys

641
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,329
don't have to worry about that I'm just

642
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:09,069
telling you the weird things that the

643
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:10,480
media is reminding us of that's because

644
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,829
people come from out of town they know

645
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,569
that celebrities are gonna fly into

646
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:14,980
Colorado and oftentimes when that

647
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:17,918
happens you see pictures of said

648
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,868
celebrities on social media and grows in

649
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,190
Colorado and a lot of the grows it's if

650
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:22,868
you've been to a few of them you can

651
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,100
recognize them like I can scroll up

652
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,449
there and be like oh that's that grow

653
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,618
that's that grow just cuz I've seen them

654
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,048
a lot I know who does what

655
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,509
so the meb sees that and they're like oh

656
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:32,950
look this bunch of rappers is in this

657
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,169
grow and here's one guy with the badge

658
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,369
and they can see that [ __ ] so be careful

659
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,809
if you're doing that also if you have

660
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:39,069
this is not on the paper but if you have

661
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:40,450
visitors in there don't let them touch

662
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,788
product and don't post pictures of

663
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,470
people touching product because visitors

664
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:46,298
cannot touch product that's illegal

665
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,788
all right I'm gonna continue with the

666
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:50,829
bubbles the next bubble says no free

667
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:52,868
product you cannot giveaway marijuana or

668
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:55,538
marijuana product to a consumer for any

669
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:56,980
reason so that means no free [ __ ] no

670
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:58,808
free you can't say buy two of these get

671
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,519
one free you can't do that you can say

672
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:02,200
buy two get one for a penny but you

673
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,548
can't do them for free there are

674
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,119
loopholes around everything but no free

675
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:09,329
[ __ ] sales limits one ounce of flour is

676
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:11,069
equal to 80

677
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:13,889
ten milligram servings in edibles or

678
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:15,509
eight grams of concentrates so if you

679
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,490
are an out-of-state shopper or if you're

680
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:18,539
shopping recreationally and that's just

681
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,650
a recreational thing that's not a

682
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,960
medical marijuana think this is

683
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,830
recreational one ounce of flowers is

684
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,900
equal to 80 ten milligrams serving

685
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:29,490
edibles or eight grams of concentrates

686
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,960
so that's how they do the math on

687
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,339
deciding how much you are allowed to

688
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,110
purchase so if you're coming from

689
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,329
out-of-state and you want to meet reach

690
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,159
your limit that's the conversion that

691
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:41,939
you have to do to break it down you can

692
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,350
either get eighty ten milligram servings

693
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,769
of edibles or eight grams of

694
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,179
concentrates those are your limits all

695
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,799
right so I'm gonna continue on with the

696
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,660
little bubble here's the red bubble it

697
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,029
says no consumption on premises a

698
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,690
license II shall not permit consumption

699
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:59,369
of MJ or MJ product on premises so no

700
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,390
marijuana consumption on site a lot of

701
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:02,459
people think you can go to the

702
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,810
dispensary and smoke weed there a lot of

703
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,180
people think we're at the gross smoking

704
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:08,250
weed there no you cannot smoke weed

705
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,720
anywhere regulated by the marijuana

706
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,640
Enforcement Division everything is on

707
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,900
camera from a thousand different angles

708
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,280
there is nowhere I can go in that

709
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,660
building to pick my nose or scratch my

710
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,940
ass that will not be on camera other

711
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,860
than a restroom every square inch of

712
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,930
that facility is on camera

713
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,869
probably from two angles they want you

714
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,039
on camera from two angles at all times

715
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,229
all right we'll keep moving that says

716
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,389
hours of operation no sales before or

717
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,029
after 8 a.m. to 12 a.m.

718
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,350
unless restricted further by local

719
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,720
jurisdiction some of the places around

720
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:38,730
here I think are forced to be done by

721
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,230
9:00 I think the rule is I'm not certain

722
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,519
on that I don't shop at a dispensary a

723
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,470
lot to tell you the truth guys I only go

724
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,329
to one and it's in Colorado Springs they

725
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,440
are regulated they're forced to close at

726
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:48,750
nine o'clock and Springs

727
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,600
and their medical only so the bubbles

728
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,480
continue they say check ID must be valid

729
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,339
government-issued ID so you can use your

730
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,289
military ID you can use your normal

731
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,919
state issued ID you can use your

732
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,329
passport

733
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,310
but you have to have a valid

734
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:05,279
government-issued ID it cannot be

735
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,139
expired advertising it just says follow

736
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,609
appropriate requirements for advertising

737
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,950
you're not allowed to have sign spinners

738
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:13,859
you can't do that kind of stuff product

739
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,630
limit centers can only have patient two

740
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,549
ounce allowance that's right if it's a

741
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,110
medical marijuana sinner the amount of

742
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:21,059
product you're allowed to have on hand

743
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:22,039
is based on how many people are signed

744
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,509
up as

745
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,639
for you as their provider for that

746
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,339
facility so you're only allowed to have

747
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,140
your patient 2 ounce allowance you can't

748
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,209
overload because it's 4/20 you can't

749
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,040
have extra inventory on stock because

750
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,769
you plan on running through it you're

751
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,470
gonna have to have a driver at your grow

752
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:42,170
or wherever your product is stored ready

753
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,660
to transfer that product and on demand

754
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,890
whenever you run out of a jar or a few

755
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,269
pounds of something and you can take a

756
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,190
five pound delivery you got to have a

757
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:51,339
guy bring you more so you can't have

758
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,590
extra on sight just because it's 4/20

759
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:57,289
then the last bubble says licensee may

760
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:59,629
refuse sales example to a person who is

761
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,399
impaired they're just reminding you that

762
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,800
you've got the right to refuse service

763
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,060
to anybody should you so choose if

764
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,799
somebody walks into your dispensary and

765
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,299
you just don't feel right you do have

766
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,500
the right to refuse service to that

767
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,089
person if you think they're a federal

768
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,339
agent if you think their ID may be fake

769
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,689
if you think they're intoxicated if you

770
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,279
just don't want to sell to them because

771
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,269
it doesn't feel good in your heart you

772
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:22,940
were allowed to say no all right so that

773
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,650
is a little bubble of a little memo of

774
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,450
bubbles sent out by the Colorado

775
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,860
marijuana Enforcement Division to all of

776
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,630
the businesses just to remind the

777
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,789
businesses how to keep themselves out of

778
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,190
trouble for 4/20 of course we did have

779
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:35,450
one facility experience some problems

780
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,410
and they got themselves in trouble so

781
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,600
they're trying to help us out and make

782
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,040
