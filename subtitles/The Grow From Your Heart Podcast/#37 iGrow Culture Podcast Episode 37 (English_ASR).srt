you to come to one yeah yeah all right

196
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,598
so um we were talking about building

197
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,918
your Grow rooms and last night there

198
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:11,439
were actually some new Growers at the

199
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,478
party and we got to help them build

200
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,598
pretty sweet room it was kind of nice to

201
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:16,399
they're like we don't know what to do

202
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:17,800
and Jesse and I looked at each other and

203
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,878
it was neat cuz we had the exact same

204
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,360
idea in our heads we're like do this and

205
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,960
they pretty much are going to do that I

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,280
think yeah uh so in this show we're

207
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,560
going to talk about a few different ways

208
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,318
to set up a grow space uh that is

209
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,240
suitable for your production needs I

210
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,280
also o found a comment on the Facebook

211
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,439
page that asks for guidance in building

212
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,918
a space for

213
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,199
$500 uh that's a really tight budget for

214
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,478
a grow room but I'll see what I can come

215
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,759
up with I Googled a few items uh to try

216
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,560
to save some pennies but that's a

217
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,360
challenge dude 500 bucks um how big is

218
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,918
the space well she just said help me out

219
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,400
teach me how to build a space for 500

220
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,038
bucks she said she's uh on a very low

221
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,318
budget uh I have her Facebook comment

222
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,439
I'd have to read to remember exactly

223
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,840
what she said but I think she's also

224
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,038
disabled so we're going to have to build

225
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,439
her something that's not heavy that's

226
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,038
not a lot work yeah I have an idea

227
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,360
that's accessible and I want to build

228
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,240
like a PVC frame and then wrap it in

229
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,199
some sort of myar type thing and then uh

230
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,439
maybe hang a small T5 light in there

231
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah and that'll get her going you know

232
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,560
we'll talk more about that we'll get

233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,759
that going once we get into the uh the

234
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,280
building the grow stuff a little more uh

235
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
let's talk about building grows uh

236
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,559
there's a few things to consider when

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,120
you're going to plan your grow before

238
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,399
you even go to the hardware store before

239
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,959
you ever go to the hydro shop there's

240
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,719
stuff you got to think about the first

241
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,559
thing to think about in my opinion is is

242
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,360
it legal where you are uh I'm not going

243
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,199
to help you break the law the first part

244
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,519
of this is uh move to a location where

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,640
Canabis is is legal if you want to

246
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,639
follow my rules so don't do this in an

247
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,519
illegal State move to Colorado go to

248
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,439
California or even better do what you

249
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,519
can to get cannabis legalized or

250
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,000
decriminalized where you are so that you

251
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,080
can grow legally I don't want to be

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
responsible for you breaking the law so

253
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,079
if you plan on Breaking the Law just

254
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,959
change to another

255
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,239
podcast all right uh

256
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,439
sorry I don't want I don't want to go to

257
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,039
I don't want you to go to jail for what

258
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm telling you but you're going to do

259
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,559
what you're going to do so uh the next

260
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,480
thing to think about uh understand the

261
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,838
risk you're taking because if you're

262
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,759
growing in a state that's not legal the

263
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,800
consequences can be quite severe it's

264
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,519
not just you you're putting at risk uh

265
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,479
if you're growing in a house everybody

266
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,078
in that house is in trouble uh if you

267
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,959
have a family and you go to jail that's

268
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:25,278
going to just cause a tidal wave of

269
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,518
[ __ ] in your life so keep that in

270
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,600
mind uh the next thing that I would say

271
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
to think about is what are your

272
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,278
realistic needs if you're committed

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,159
you're going to grow some cannabis for

274
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,679
yourself what are your realistic needs

275
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,000
do you need to grow for yourself your

276
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,239
family uh maybe a few patients or are

277
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,159
you trying to become the next big

278
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,839
production facility in your area so my

279
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,519
next idea would be set a goal and kind

280
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,079
of stick with that for a few Cycles to

281
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,360
see what you're doing you can't you're

282
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,439
not going to know how good of a grower

283
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,320
or what kind of crop you get on the

284
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
first grow stick with that set something

285
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,839
up stick with it for a couple of cycles

286
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,920
and then adjust to your needs after

287
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,240
you've gone a couple rounds like don't

288
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,599
run your first lap and then think my

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,079
shoes are too tight my shoes are too

290
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,959
loose run a couple laps see what you're

291
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:07,359
good at then adjust so my next thing to

292
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,199
consider I would say is does your

293
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,480
location have viable

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
electricity um this is something Jesse

295
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,120
really stressed on when he got here to

296
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,480
talk about this uh running more than one

297
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,000
or two th000 watt lights in a room may

298
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,720
require some electrical upgrades if you

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,679
want to be safe if your Breakers are

300
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
flipping and you're scrambling to keep

301
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,439
everything running that's when you're

302
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,760
creating a fire hazard yeah and you

303
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,320
don't want to be on the news for burning

304
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,000
down your house grown weed no

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,959
uh in your experience can you usually

306
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,559
just run like a th000 watt light the

307
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,159
blower that it requires and a couple of

308
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,679
fans and if you have like a hydro

309
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,958
bubbler or whatever is that pretty much

310
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,479
what one room can do yeah most most

311
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,199
residential rooms have about 30 30 amps

312
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
30 amp breaker yeah so that you're and

313
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,480
if you're putting an air conditioner in

314
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,039
there you're taking up half a breaker

315
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,519
just with that the light takes up about

316
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,199
half a breaker uh if you're flip in the

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,759
breaker when you turn on the dishwasher

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,879
or whatever uh have an electrician come

319
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,000
and help you out there are a lot of

320
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,519
electric

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
actually if you're in the PUO area I

322
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,679
have an electrician that I will refer

323
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
because he's looking for some work he's

324
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,799
off and he could use your uh your job so

325
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,879
uh don't burn down the house please

326
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,919
please don't burn down the house don't

327
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,559
create that fire hazard with electricity

328
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,759
also if you're in illegal in an illegal

329
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,799
State this is something I just thought

330
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,759
of you're going to have to have an

331
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,120
excuse for all that

332
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,360
electricity yeah if your 1,000 watt

333
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,078
light is going to kick your light bill

334
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,639
up about $100 per month an additional

335
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,000
like the light and the fan and the

336
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,839
blower it takes to run it you're looking

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,958
about another $100 every every month uh

338
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,880
if you're just a dude in an apartment or

339
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,638
something like that that may spark some

340
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,240
concerns you might want to get a hot tub

341
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,879
uh we've heard of people using welding

342
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,600
equipment just get something to kind of

343
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,278
make it look like you're doing something

344
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,920
put a bunch of table saws in the garage

345
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,200
if you've got that option you know look

346
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,799
like you have some more for that powder

347
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,000
consumption to go empty empty saltwater

348
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,000
fish

349
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,919
tanks uh but you know all of that stuff

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,039
I bet you they can tell that my timers

351
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,039
are on 1212 over at the crow you know

352
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,000
they're like like oh yeah every day at

353
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,360
8:00 this guy kicks on thousands of

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,480
watts and then every day at 8:00 they

355
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,839
kick off they're not [ __ ] sorry if

356
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,360
[ __ ] is an offensive or to you uh so

357
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,199
will you be able to ventilate your space

358
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
is the next thing I would think about uh

359
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,198
fresh air is super important stale

360
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,359
stagnant humid air is the number one

361
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,719
cause for powdery mildew it'll also slow

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,839
your growth it makes your plants look

363
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
ugly makes room stink you want to be

364
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
able to walk into your grow room and

365
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,278
close your eyes and not smell pot you

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,159
want it to smell like a nice clean room

367
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,000
so keep that in mind you have to be able

368
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,159
to ventilate that space number five on

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,320
my list of things that you should

370
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,958
consider is your grow space safe and

371
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,800
secure you may need to hide your grow

372
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,599
from the landlord or your nosy in-laws

373
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,879
that come over for dinner are you ready

374
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,560
to live the grow life in your house that

375
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,240
doesn't sound like a huge question but

376
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,359
dude when you've got pot plants in your

377
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,399
house your whole house will stink if you

378
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,079
don't have it under control you might

379
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,679
need some carbon filters you might need

380
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,319
an extra carbon filter or two um I

381
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,958
always have a carbon filter on the air

382
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,639
that is going out the exhaust

383
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,919
but then also I'll hang a carbon filter

384
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,480
with a blower on it just right in the

385
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,719
middle of the room on the ceiling to act

386
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,079
as a scrubber just to clean even more

387
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,079
air and that eliminates more odor uh we

388
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,638
were talking about Ona gel last night

389
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,319
they sell Ona jar Ona gels in like a

390
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,639
plastic jar they say to take the lid off

391
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,560
and just leave it sitting but I actually

392
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,879
poke little pencil size holes with the

393
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,000
drill right in the lid and then just let

394
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,958
it sit and then once it gets down to

395
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,360
about a third of the jar I just add like

396
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,838
a half a cup of water in there and shake

397
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,159
it and it rehydrates all the crystals

398
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
and it lasts a little longer uh put

399
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,519
those by your door like your entryway to

400
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,439
your home or entry way to wherever

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
you're growing and people's nose will

402
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
hit that first and now their nose is

403
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
already kind of they've been punched so

404
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
they're confused and when they smell the

405
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,639
herb they won't know that it's herb

406
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,720
hopefully yeah so you can put them in

407
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,440
inside your ducting too oh yeah that's a

408
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
good idea there you go it'll blow that

409
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,360
move that odor around instead of the

410
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
Cannabis odor I'm going to add a random

411
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,720
side note this is just a really random

412
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,680
sidebar cuz I just thought about it I

413
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,040
keep hearing a lot of people say the

414
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,799
word marijuana marijuana is a racist

415
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,679
word and it sounds bad people are afraid

416
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,319
of marijuana cannabis is the new word uh

417
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,198
cannabis sounds better it doesn't sound

418
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,120
as racist and I know that's a weird way

419
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,838
to put it but we were taught that

420
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,278
marijuana is the devil and if you smoke

421
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,360
marijuana you're going to get crazy and

422
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:22,000
rape white [ __ ] cannabis will heal

423
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,600
you cannabis stops cancer so I think we

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,519
should just try to abandon the word

425
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,399
marijuana and say cannabis a lot more

426
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
that's just my random uh sidebar for the

427
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,399
day marijuana actually literally is a

428
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,399
racist word it was yeah I mean yeah yeah

429
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,958
don't don't doubt that people it was

430
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,039
invented by the government to that's a

431
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,679
huge history lesson uh to discriminate

432
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,198
against Mexicans yeah they didn't like

433
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,198
the Mexicans that were coming to America

434
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,319
and smoking marijuanas yeah and then

435
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:47,799
bringing it to the Jazz musicians that's

436
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,278
all reer Madness you guys hopefully you

437
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,879
know about that already and hopefully no

438
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,320
hopefully you're not that brainwashed

439
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,360
and you never paid attention to that

440
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,320
hopefully you just call it cannabis all

441
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,680
right uh safe and secure grow space

442
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,120
living the grow life another big thing

443
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,958
to consider is the location of your grow

444
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,480
inside of your house or wherever you're

445
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,119
doing it uh the basement is generally

446
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
the coolest spot you're insulated by

447
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,799
dirt and concrete walls and you're

448
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,839
underground you don't get a lot of

449
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,319
climate changes there in the basement

450
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,880
also hopefully you don't get a lot of

451
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,480
traffic down there in the basement you

452
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,919
got like one room in the corner in the

453
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,039
back or something you can just dedicate

454
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,599
uh the attic is going to get hot the

455
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,439
attic is the top of the house it's

456
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,000
getting hit by the sun um you don't have

457
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,480
all this insulation from the dirt and

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,159
the concrete walls the attic is going to

459
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,039
be a little more challenging so you're

460
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,399
going to need more cooling power you're

461
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,439
going to have to adjust your snow melts

462
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,919
off the or the snow melts off your roof

463
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,399
in the middle of the winter and it's the

464
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,399
only house in the neighborhood you're

465
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,519
the only house that your roof is clean

466
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,198
because you just melt yeah uh I've had

467
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,759
to make an adjustment because I noticed

468
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,240
that I was melting snow somewhere one

469
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,560
year I was like oh that's obvious as

470
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
[ __ ] uh also guys this is something

471
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,479
we'll cover cover a little later but I

472
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,799
want to jump to it you're going to have

473
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,240
to get water there so putting your

474
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,639
plants in the Attic uh once you get all

475
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
the grow equipment hung up up there and

476
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,318
everything's up there now you have to

477
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,800
get water up there often so keep that in

478
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,919
mind um and then another go ahead you

479
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,399
got something to add adct just if you

480
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,639
can avoid it's just really not a good

481
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,559
place to grow it's actually a pretty

482
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,440
pretty good uh fire hazard oh yeah so I

483
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,039
mean uh it's uh I mean a significant

484
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,880
fire hazard um

485
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,480
so avoid addict at all cost if you're in

486
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,240
like Wisconsin or something though and

487
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,199
you can't really do it like we can here

488
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,919
in Colorado nobody goes to anybody

489
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,240
else's atcts so that may be someone's

490
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,879
only option for sure guys like we we

491
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,440
were talking about earlier be safe and I

492
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,679
know this sounds cheesy as hell but

493
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,199
safety first bro you don't want to be on

494
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,519
the news for burning down your house

495
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,799
growing pot because when the news comes

496
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,720
you might have been growing legal

497
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,439
medical cannabis but as soon as that

498
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,000
fire starts and the News truck pulls out

499
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
you've got a drug lab yeah they're not

500
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,240
going to be polite this this medical

501
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,720
marijuana provider accidentally sparked

502
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,079
fire to his home now the report's going

503
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,240
to say we're here in front of this house

504
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,758
where there's a major drug lab on fire

505
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,120
right now that's what the reports and

506
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,160
you're going to be the [ __ ] that just

507
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,439
went to jail for doing that that was a

508
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,720
nice news voice you like that yeah yeah

509
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,679
sounded really weird in the headphones I

510
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,199
had to bail on it kind of quickly um so

511
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,559
yeah try to go lower in the house is

512
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,199
better um in PUO they're trying to

513
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,918
actually push push an ordinance to where

514
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,519
we have to grow in an out building and I

515
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,720
was reading a book doing research on

516
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,000
this and in Jorge cant book he says

517
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,439
outbuildings are actually the worst

518
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,640
place you could think about growing

519
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,519
because that's where thieves are and the

520
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,360
cops don't consider that trespassing so

521
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,319
they can go into your outb building it's

522
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,038
not part of your home oh nice yeah so

523
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,200
the cops can walk right in that's not

524
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,759
it's a different rule you know it's not

525
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,160
part of your domicile it's a shed so

526
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,038
they can walk right into that they don't

527
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,400
need a warrant that's something we got

528
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,759
to remind all the people that are

529
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,559
opposed to this of Mike did you just

530
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,440
hear that bro your out building that

531
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,038
they're trying to propose that we build

532
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,038
will not be part of your home so it will

533
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,480
not require a warrant is what this book

534
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,440
that Jorge cantes wrote says let me know

535
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,558
how that really works

536
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,000
shout out to Mike he's my legal counsel

537
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,399
um growing in a shed has a lot of

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
challenges too um so it it's going to be

539
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,200
a lot like growing in an attic as far as

540
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
uh trying to insulate it and cool it

541
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,759
okay all that it's going to be very

542
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,480
difficult and I guess I should uh one

543
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,079
more thing The Next Step here is how are

544
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,839
you going to cool the room keep in mind

545
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,359
that you have to use more electricity

546
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,279
for that air conditioner and the air

547
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,359
conditioner has to vent itself somewhere

548
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,639
so you keep in mind how you're going to

549
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,759
cool the room um I had a good point that

550
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,520
I wanted to make and it just left my

551
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,519
head what were you just telling

552
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:39,158
me what was that with the with the sheds

553
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,319
yeah the sheds okay what our goal is I

554
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,400
guess I should have covered this more in

555
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,038
the beginning but your goal when you're

556
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,000
building a grow room you want as much

557
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,879
control of the lights the air the water

558
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,240
the humidity the temperature that's what

559
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,280
we're trying to do we're trying to build

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,919
a room that we can control to set the

561
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,038
ideal climate for these plants uh I

562
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,200
guess it we should instead of just

563
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,519
starting building a room we should know

564
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,159
what we're trying to build right and

565
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,000
that's what you want you want a room

566
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,840
that you can almost automate and let

567
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,440
that happen and just turn everything on

568
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,038
properly get everything set up properly

569
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,279
and let it run and then when the night

570
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,919
time comes you have a nighttime

571
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,359
temperature selected it'll get to that

572
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,400
when the daytime comes again you have a

573
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,678
daytime temp selected the air

574
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,080
conditioner kicks on at the right time

575
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,360
your fans move at the right time your

576
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,319
blowers are all at the right schedule

577
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:29,158
then you can hit that perfect like 50%

578
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,399
humidity or 40% humidity mark you can

579
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,880
get your 77 degree Mark in there uh you

580
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,080
can get it all perfect you can have just

581
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,919
a little bit of

582
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,759
wind that's what you're trying to do

583
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,080
you're trying to build that super happy

584
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,960
trying to build an aquarium for your

585
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,960
plants or like a cage for plants like

586
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,919
the perfect habitat for these plants a

587
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,400
sub climate inside your house inside

588
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,360
your house yeah that that's your goal I

589
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,360
guess I should have talked more about

590
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,079
that at the beginning um once you

591
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,879
achieve that you know pretty dial in

592
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:59,720
perfect climate uh growing becomes a lot

593
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,960
easier a lot lot easier the the room is

594
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,079
the room the genetics uh this what

595
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,798
you're feeding and then the grow like

596
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,720
how you grow that's pretty much what

597
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,720
your components are y uh lights air

598
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,440
water soil and love you know cleanliness

599
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,319
cleanliness is Next to Godliness when it

600
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,558
comes to Growing every little piece of

601
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,359
trash or scrap and not just in your grow

602
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,558
room if your grow room is in like your

603
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,519
mom's basement or your Grandma's Attic

604
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,839
or your bedroom closet all of those

605
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,720
clothes all those books all those scraps

606
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,558
of paper all those cigarette butts all

607
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,600
the dust that's all a place for a

608
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,480
spidermite to hide that's all a place

609
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,519
for a thrip to lay a bug also all that

610
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,038
dust and cigarette smoke will end up in

611
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,558
your concentrate and in your flowers if

612
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,839
you're I've kind of stop sweeping my

613
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,279
grow room now after about week six

614
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,119
because I don't want to stir up the dust

615
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,839
and put it in my flowers I will let my

616
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,719
grow room look a little shitty on the

617
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,158
floor for a week to not sweep it up as

618
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,960
often cuz I don't and I'll turn off all

619
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,880
the fans and blowers and air condition

620
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,079
now to sweep up CU I don't want that

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
sticking to my buds because that ends up

622
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,720
in the hash and we're trying to make the

623
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,038
best hash we can now that's that's seems

624
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,839
to be the point that everybody's headed

625
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,278
to I still try to grow the best flowers

626
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,558
but of course we want the best hash to

627
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:17,599
go with that yeah all right that was a

628
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,839
long rant uh other than things to

629
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,158
consider there are responsibilities that

630
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,199
I think you should uh practice being a

631
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,760
good

632
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,000
grower um when you're setting up to grow

633
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,440
you don't want to piss off the neighbors

634
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,798
you don't want to attract unwanted

635
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,000
attention by thieves or thugs you don't

636
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,079
want to get cop attention you definitely

637
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,640
this is something people don't think

638
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,079
about there are kids out there that love

639
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,200
to steal pot plants now uh kids are

640
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,798
getting braver the younger kids are

641
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,679
getting dumber and braver they know what

642
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,679
pot is they know how to find a grow and

643
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,320
they want to steal your [ __ ] so keep the

644
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,559
pot and there's also innocent kids that

645
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,119
will just see your pot and want to steal

646
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,158
it just because they're curious so be

647
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,759
careful keep your pot away from the kids

648
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,520

good in that iy genetics t-shirt so a

670
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,919
few responsibilities being a grower uh

671
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,360
make sure your lights are not visible

672
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,038
from the outside uh when you set up your

673
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,278
grow room and the sun goes down turn on

674
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,079
all your grow lights walk outside

675
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,240
whatever if you're in the basement attic

676
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,599
bedroom walk outside and see if you can

677
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,720
see your grow lights if you can see your

678
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,319
grow lights fix it you're failing that's

679
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
a problem that also means you have a

680
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,599
light leak yeah that means the lights

681
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,679
are getting in during your flowering

682
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,158
cycle which are just going to cause a

683
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,320
bunch of

684
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
hermaphrodites also your next

685
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,439
responsibility make sure the blowers and

686
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,240
fans are not heard by neighbors or

687
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
people walking past your grow uh if

688
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
there's a spot where you don't think

689
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,840
people will ever walk the day you build

690
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,319
a damn grow someone's going to walk

691
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,439
there the meter made the gas guy uh some

692
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,480
kid chasing his dog some cop looking for

693
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
someone else going to walk right past

694
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
that blower and they're going to go oh

695
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,240
what is this and you're going to think

696
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,798
no one's ever going to walk there but as

697
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
soon as you put a blower there dude they

698
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:40,079
will that's the way life works so just

699
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,480
be careful plan ahead make sure no one

700
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,480
can hear your blowers make sure no one

701
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,960
can see your lights there's ways to

702
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,880
muffle you know even to insulating the

703
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,840
duct insulating the blower uh you can

704
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,200
disguise Outlets as a dryer Outlet yeah

705
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,119
you can try to put it through the roof

706
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
or you know just move the blower to the

707
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,479
other end of the chain so it's not so

708
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,120
noisy yeah not right at the window yeah

709
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,599
uh those Mufflers are a great idea

710
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,839
they're actually available at high grow

711
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,678
window or growing supplies yeah and

712
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:12,278
actually um a cheaper alternative to the

713
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,720
mufflers and uh better for your grow is

714
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:18,319
a hea filter yes those will you know if

715
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,960
it's sucking in those will help uh you

716
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,879
know over uh all of my ends where I have

717
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,759
I've drilled like 6inch holes or 8 in

718
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
holes to have my ends coming in I get

719
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,720
those little square HEPA filters they're

720
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,558
just a sheet I guess they're a rectangle

721
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,480
and I just staple right over it with a

722
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:33,639
staple gun onto the wall for sure yeah

723
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,399
wherever I do a grow you want yeah that

724
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,720
keeps your bugs out keeps all this stuff

725
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:38,678
that you don't want in your hat it keeps

726
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,440
all that out of there filter everything

727
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,640
twice twice if you

728
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,038
can people are going oh my God how much

729
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
is this going to cost building a good

730
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,119
grow room does cost a little bit of

731
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,798
money people were asking last night

732
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,558
they're like we've got this much budget

733
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,319
should we buy better this or better this

734
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,879
and that's kind of where I I think you

735
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,038
should get the best bulbs and ballast

736
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,559
you can that's your first start and then

737
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,038
moving your air and then like if you

738
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,519
have to buy in chunks I think you buy

739
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,079
the lights and then your air moving

740
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,720
stuff like you're ducting your blowers

741
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:09,678
and then your air conditioner and then

742
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,480
you buy your pots and soil and nutrients

743
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,720
uh start with the room and just buy

744
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,360
slowly instead of but yeah it's all that

745
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,319
choosing where the weakest link is

746
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,558
always going to be the weakest link yeah

747
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,079
it's hard to decide where to pinch your

748
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,798
budget there get the good bulbs and good

749
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,639
ballasts that's definitely my opinion so

750
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,319
uh here's a big issue that we've been

751
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
dealing with here in peblo this caus

752
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,038
cused a lot of most of our new laws here

753
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,278
that are being proposed in PUO are

754
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,558
because of this issue make sure nobody

755
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,159
can smell your grow the smell is the

756
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,960
most offensive and revealing part of

757
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,760
your grow yes I said offensive there are

758
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,798
some people that do not love the smell

759
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,839
of Sweet Sweet Sticky ganja in the

760
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:47,398
morning there's a guy here in our city

761
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,038
that keeps complaining to city council

762
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,239
that he can smell pot every day when he

763
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,558
wakes up because his neighbors are

764
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,558
growing the Dank not a fan yeah keep

765
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,678
that smell down uh if you build your

766
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,480
grow discreetly and you don't bring

767
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,798
attention to your neighbors will never

768
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,159
know you've got to grow in your home

769
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:07,278
it's a security issue too being able to

770
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,880
I mean yeah oh yeah you know don't you

771
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,880
know that's just inviting people in man

772
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,320
or people not only thieves but mooches

773
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,799
like you make more friends than you've

774
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,918

again you know uh several years ago I

781
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,440
lived in another house and I had a grow

782
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:36,918
in the basement there and the power went

783
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,038
out and I was midflower so it's stinks

784
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,159
dude and the um the power guys had to

785
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,558
come through everybody's backyard

786
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,039
looking for the problem and I wasn't at

787
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,278
the place but my girlfriend was there

788
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,679

789
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,558

00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,000
just made a cringing face and went in

793
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
the house and told me about it later but

794

803
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,919
to be a good responsible grower when

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,520
you're building a grow room do whatever

805

810
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,000
uh that's like the biggest black eye you

811
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,558
can put on the Cannabis Community right

812
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,798
now is letting kids get caught with your

813
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:37,359
weed yeah here's something you might not

814
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,359
think about most of the stuff was kind

815
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,759
of uh kind of obvious but here's a good

816
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,199
one you're going to create a lot of

817
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,240
waste growing plants in your house

818
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,759
you're going to have soil you're going

819
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,640
to have plant stems and stocks you're

820
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,398
going to have root balls find a

821
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,278
responsible way to dispose of everything

822
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,879
um some of you guys live out in the

823
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:57,200
rural areas burn that [ __ ] if you can uh

824
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,080
us compost it compost it if you can

825
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,720
that's yeah but see I in the city and my

826
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,960
girl is in a city facility and so it's

827
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,880
all got to be chopped up into little

828
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,480
tiny pieces and put into secured trash

829
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,880
bags and it's got to be destroyed on

830
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,558
site like so you other guys you're going

831
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,880
to have to find what if the trash guy is

832
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:14,240
dump in your trash and finds all your

833
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,320
pot leaves in Connecticut when you're

834
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,558
growing pot uh what if he's not cool

835
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,079
what if he is cool then he's going to

836
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:21,119
want your weed and he's going to rob you

837
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,599
if he is not cool he's calling the cops

838
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,678
so be careful uh they might find your

839
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,719
trash that's they cannot from Jorge's

840
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,200
book that I read they cannot start a

841
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,038
case based on your trash that does not

842
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,600
justify a search warrant but the trash

843
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:41,119
can be used in court as part of the case

844
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,959
so evidence yep keep an eye on the trash

845
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,199
actually know people I lived in Lawrence

846
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,720
Kansas and now that I think about it I

847
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,880
know people that got busted and had

848
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,839
their trash used as evidence in court

849
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,799
now that I think about it I can't

850
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,278
remember their names but uh couple of

851
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,038
kids I worked at a place with what's up

852
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:57,200
guys I I've heard that uh for you know

853
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,519
drug drug dealing cases back in the day

854
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,519
and stuff find that tape they wrap

855
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,440
around the packaging yeah I had that

856
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,038
happen to a friend too I worked at a

857
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,960
bowling alley and I found a bunch of

858
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,519
that tape that dark colored tape and you

859
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
could tell it was wrapped around like a

860
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,679
I've seen plenty of pounds of weed like

861
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,320
brick pounds of weed I don't know if it

862
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,440
was wrapped around weed or some cocaine

863
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,319
or something but it was that kind of

864
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,960
tape and I know exactly somebody had a

865
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,359
nice bulk of something in my bowling

866
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,880
alley one night wow you found that in

867
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,319
the trash at the bowling alley in the

868
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,000
trash in the bathroom just sitting on

869
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,639
the top so you're telling me that

870
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,519
someone at evidence lockup may have been

871
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,919
crooked

872
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,480
no not the evidence tape that would that

873
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
would be a lot cooler you know that like

874
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,640
brown tape they wrapped the kilos with

875
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,599
it was a bunch of that so somebody had a

876
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,799
kilo of Coke or a pound of weed in the

877
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,240
bowling alley which isn't really

878
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,798
surprising now that I'm thinking about

879
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,120
it yeah bowling alleys are kind of

880
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:48,679
sketchy places that people don't think

881
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,158
about so think about what you guys are

882
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,320
going to do with your trash Guys you got

883
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,519
a bunch of [ __ ] you're going to have to

884
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,359
throw away and not look obvious with it

885
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,120
if you've got more than two lights when

886
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,599
you harvest four lights worth of stuff

887
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,319
three lights worth of stuff that's a lot

888
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,240
of trash to take care of and if you

889
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,038
don't know what to do if you don't know

890
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,558
how to recycle and compost your soil

891
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,759
you've got soil to deal with too uh it's

892
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,319

to grow equipment is pretty cheap

959
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,119
nowadays don't don't use some sketchy

960
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,799
ass old [ __ ] if you're running a bunch

961

00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,879
it into the 240 and plug all the lights

963
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,319
into that and you're pretty much legit

964
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,519
you can run like eight lights on that

965
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:33,798
thing oh N9 or 12 yeah yeah yeah um I've

run extension cords all over the D no

971

998
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,759
that's that's what we're talking about

999
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,440
there's no need yeah no reason for it

1000
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,798
that that should be you know one of the

1001
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,200
number one things when you're setting up

1002
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:50,440
a grow room is guys I always add a fire

1003
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,639
extinguisher and a smoke alarm uh I put

1004
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,639
a smoke detector in The Grow rooms uh

1005
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:56,558
put it near the the exhaust fan like if

1006
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,359
you've got a carbon filter sucking air

1007
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,798
out put it near there cuz the smoke is

1008
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,959
going to get sucked toward that uh and

1009
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,960
that way put the smoke alarm there I put

1010
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,440
a fire extinguisher outside of the damn

1011
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,199
grow room because you don't want to have

1012
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,559
to run in there and get the extinguisher

1013
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,799
if that room is on fire you want to be

1014
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,878
able to kick in the door and just start

1015
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,560
spraying that [ __ ] uh at hyro indoor

1016
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,440
growing supplies you can pick up an item

1017
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,918
called The Flame Defender I haven't used

1018
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,119
it I've done a lot of research about it

1019
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,598
uh that that I need those those look

1020
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,079
like the way to go I think we're going

1021
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,240
to get ourselves set up with those yeah

1022
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,119
some we'll test them hopefully never to

1023
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,519
test them out hopefully we never find

1024
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,720
out how good those work all right um so

1025
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,358
guys once you figured out how much herb

1026
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,118
you need to produce that's when you can

1027
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,159
start designing your grow space uh

1028
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,838
actually sometimes your space dictates

1029
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,639
how you build your grow that's where

1030
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,480
that's where the fun kicks in in my

1031
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,039
opinion uh building and grow is all

1032
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,519
about adapting to the space you're

1033
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,119
provided some of you guys are going to

1034
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,960
use a small closet some of you might use

1035
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,599
a spare bedroom some of you guys are

1036
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,480
going to buy a grow Hut and set that up

1037
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,880
I will do a lot of talking about a grow

1038
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,599
Hut maybe not on this episode we're

1039
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,240
already 35 minutes in uh but I will

1040
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,519
definitely I'm writing that down grow

1041
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:08,399
Hut they're very versatile yeah um a lot

1042
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,400
of people made fun of them at first but

1043
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,280
I have done some breeding I've done some

1044
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,079
feno selection I've done some great

1045
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,200
growing in just a grow Hut they're great

1046
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,800
if you have limited space you can put it

1047
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,319
in the corner of your bedroom and it's

1048
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,680
awesome I've seen a whole bedroom full

1049
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,880
of them that was uh quite the little

1050
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,598
production area so it's pretty neat so

1051
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,200
uh since I'm only allowed a small plant

1052
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,320
count here in Pueblo in my house in a

1053
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:39,118
spare bedroom I run two 5x5 Hydro huts

1054
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,559
on a flip box uh with a 600 watt light

1055
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,920
in each Hut but what happens I run one

1056
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,480
ballast the ballast plugs into the wall

1057
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,318
on a timer so it goes ballast and then

1058
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,920
there's a cord that goes to the flip box

1059
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:53,199
and then the flip box has two cords that

1060
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,159
come out and a bulb comes from each one

1061
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,879
and every 12 hours side a lights up and

1062
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,000
then for 12 hours it stays on on and

1063
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,000
then it shuts off and the other side

1064
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,880
comes on for 12 hours so instead of

1065
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,358
adding electrical upgrades to that

1066
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,440
bedroom that I'm just using in the

1067
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,799
winter as a grow space for the it keeps

1068
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,559
the house warm up here actually so I

1069
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,359
just run that uh using the flip box I

1070
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,519
can use that room all the time and have

1071
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,440
it flowering constantly and not have any

1072
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,838
downtime in that room nice yeah so uh

1073
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,760
it's like a an 11 it's like a 14 by9

1074
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,759
room so those two 5x5 Huts fit perfectly

1075
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,240
in there it gives me a little bit of

1076
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,400
room to work because I really like the

1077
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,759
grow Huts a lot of people talk [ __ ]

1078
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,639
about and hate on them they're amazing

1079
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,319
that's my friend that was doing it uh um

1080
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,279
he didn't have the flip box but um he

1081
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,400
had two different ballast so he was you

1082
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,000
know one was on for 12 hours the other

1083
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,720
was on for 12 hours same same thing just

1084
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,960
uh he just had the extra ballast I

1085
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,039
didn't want to go buy another one you

1086
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,720
know I was like that flip box was the

1087
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,719
price of another ballast and everything

1088
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,399
so I was like I'll just do it this way

1089
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,679
and it was it's kind of a test idea I

1090
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,480
wanted to see if I could do that on a

1091
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,719
larger scale because I've designed an 18

1092
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,240
Lightroom that's two nine room or two

1093
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,719
nine light rooms on a flip box M uh and

1094
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,199
then I actually did some research and a

1095
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,480
guy named Eric bixa kind of beat me to

1096
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,679
the punch on this room that I was trying

1097
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,719
to build so it's a cool room nice it's a

1098
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,039
10 x10 room with a 10x five lung room in

1099
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,039
the middle and all of your equipment is

1100
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,400
in that middle room uhhuh and you cool

1101
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:17,960
off the all of the air in the middle

1102
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,880
room and one side sleeps so you're

1103
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,838
producing CO2 in the sleeping plants

1104
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,280
guys plants that are asleep kick off CO2

1105
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,318
if you can vent that CO2 into your

1106
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,519
flower room that's awake you can use

1107
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:28,920
that uh but so yeah you're just you got

1108
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,440
you got one air conditioner one set of

1109
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,200
ballast one dehumidifier and then you're

1110
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,880
just moving the air around to both rooms

1111
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,159
yeah for sure killer idea guys we'll

1112
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,440
talk about that that's a huge room

1113
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,598
that's a lot of money that's like multi

1114
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,159
thousand room so some of you guys are

1115
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,039
going to grow like in closets and [ __ ]

1116
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,639
that's what I saying right some of you

1117
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,079
guys are going to grow in grow Huts some

1118
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,480
of you guys might even bust out 16

1119
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,200
lights in a basement how uh however you

1120
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,280
do it there will be some obstacles

1121
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,719
presented by your existing environment

1122
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,680
that's how it goes unless you're

1123
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,159
building a building that's designed to

1124
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,239
be a grow space from the beginning

1125
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,318
you're going to have to deal with some

1126
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,919
type of obstacles that's part of the fun

1127
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,279
for me honestly yeah no totally is yeah

1128
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,800
I like taking a space like a dirty

1129
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,280
basement or a funky attic or the back

1130
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,680
part of the dispensary and making it an

1131
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,040
amazing sufficient grow with the space

1132
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,759
and power that I've got without having

1133
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,880
to do any crazy dramatic improvements to

1134
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,319
the place it's kind of a fun challenge I

1135
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,640
uh I I think I no I I don't think I know

1136
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:27,159
um I do upgrades after every single

1137
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,199
run sometimes upgrades to slow me down

1138
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,318
quite a bit yeah I've

1139
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,199
noticed you've had some downtime for a

1140
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:34,800
minute I've heard you talking about it

1141
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,199
all right so let's talk about a few

1142
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,240
things that every grow will need uh

1143
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,598
there will be more things you're going

1144
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,358
to have to add to this depending on your

1145
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,599
room and your space but every room is

1146
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,119
going to need these things this is

1147
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,039
mostly for a just one flowering room if

1148
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,640
you want to have plants vegging while

1149
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,159
you're crop flowers you're going to need

1150
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,559
a small veg room also uh eventually

1151
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,399
you're going to want a mother room and a

1152
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:58,719
clone area and a veg area and a breeding

1153
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,039
area and a place for your mail plants

1154
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,639
and a place to make pollen and

1155
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,400
a it gets ridiculous when you start

1156
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,519
doing it a whole bunch but eventually

1157
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,639
you're going to want to add more rooms

1158
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:12,159
my advice is build slowly and plan ahead

1159
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,480
with realistic expectations uh don't

1160
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,159
start counting your chickens before they

1161
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,880
hatch if you've got a light and you

1162
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,480
expect a pound of weed start thinking

1163
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,480
you got 3/4 of a pound of weed and

1164
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,920
budget for that because you're not going

1165
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,318
to grow as great as you plan your first

1166
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,838
couple of runs so make your upgrades

1167
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:29,559
Like Jesse said he makes upgrades every

1168
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,719
time kind of plan them don't go too

1169
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,119
ambitious your first couple of times

1170
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,719
like be realistic about it you can fail

1171
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:40,640
crops fail uh things that kill crops

1172
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,919
spidermites air conditioner failure if

1173
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,358
your air conditioner cuts out in the

1174
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,559
middle of a flower cycle and you're at

1175
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,400
work and it's 90° outside and you're

1176
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,480
going to come home and it's going to be

1177
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,838
108 degrees in your grow room and you're

1178
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,760
going to have crispy buds they're

1179
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:55,000
already dried and cured

1180
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,359
for that [ __ ] happens uh if you're

1181
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,760
running a hydro setup if one pump dies

1182
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,279
while you're at work or while you're

1183
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,880
asleep oh man everything can go crunchy

1184
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
don't get me started on that yeah it's

1185
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,559
happened I know I have we have a mutual

1186
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,239
friend that went to Las Vegas for two

1187
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,599
days uh he was he was supposed to go to

1188
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,318

1189
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,960

1190
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,440
vacation planned but he went for two

1191
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,440
days he flew there and flew back right

1192
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,960
away and came home and his pump took a

1193
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,318
[ __ ] while he was gone and his whole 4x4

table done yeah yeah we had a uh double

1195
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:31,838
redundancy setup you know two pumps um

1196
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:34,000
and uh on a setup at a dispensary and

1197
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,480
both faed on the same weekend while

1198

yeah no I've been trying that for a

1203
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,318
while too cannabis cannabis yeah it just

1204
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,280
sounds like a better word you know can

1205

aasta in me it's a good herb um yeah so

1207
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,039
we're talking about things that all

1208
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,759
grows need uh yeah every grow is going

1209
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,880
to need electricity duh right unless

1210
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,319
you're growing outside you need

1211
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,640
electricity you're going to need lights

1212
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,719
and timers uh you'll need intake and

1213
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,879
outtake fans and you're going to need a

1214
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,279
water source those are the basics that

1215
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,519
every grow will need um and we're at 40

1216
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,119
minutes I'm going to try to squeeze as

1217
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,119
much of this in as we can but we might

1218
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,838
not actually even get to like yeah man I

1219
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,280
mean might not get to the build part

1220
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,119
until another episode um guys I have

1221
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,880
another episode planned that is just

1222
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,358
I've had news articles set aside I've

1223
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,000
got a couple of things Mike and I wanted

1224
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:31,078
to talk about it's going to kind of go

1225
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,679
between these two build episodes I think

1226
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,680
but I might put it out as like a midweek

1227
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,118
episode so I think after we record here

1228
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,719
Mike's going to come over and [ __ ]

1229

Jesse back as soon as possible to talk

1233
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,280

1234
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:50,078
to send me so many questions I can

1235

1242
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,559
gotten your permission but lb I

1243
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,358
appreciate you for listening that's

1244
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,599
awesome so uh lights everybody needs

1245
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,598
lights lights are actually the main

1246
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,838
ingredient to your grow space uh lights

1247
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,160
dictate the cycles of the gardens uh

1248
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,199
they tell you if you're in veg or if

1249
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,358
you're in flower uh lights are also the

1250
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,919
main fuel and energy provider for your

1251
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,159
plants lights create photosynthesis

1252
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,680
lights are the main thing it's the

1253
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,239
number one nutrient yes uh put as big of

1254
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,759
a light as you can in your space is what

1255
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,598
I always

1256
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,359
say and a lot of them uh so no matter

1257
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,200
how big or small your grow space is you

1258
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:38,440
will need some sort of air exchange

1259
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:42,318
system always you got to get rid of that

1260
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,559
old stale funky air um I can't stress

1261
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,960
how important this is most of the

1262
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,880
problems I see from lowbudget grows is a

1263
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,639
lack of air flow and air exchange um

1264
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,000
moving the air around the room is great

1265
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,400
but you need to replace the uh room the

1266
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,199
air in the room also uh if you leave a

1267
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
freshly watered crop locked in a sealed

1268
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,960
closet with the light above it you're

1269
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,318
creating a very humid environment uh the

1270
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,039
plants are trying to transpire but

1271
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,880
there's too much moisture in the air and

1272
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,679
the plants Can't Sweat like they should

1273
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,599
which slows down photosynthesis and

1274
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,039
stunts growth that also makes your

1275
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,480
plants look angry and sad too uh if the

1276
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:15,239
plants are left in excessive humidity

1277
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,119
for long periods they will become very

1278
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:21,439
susceptible to our good friend powdery

1279
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,960
mildew Fu powdery mildew uh as your buds

1280
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,720
grow your risk of powdery mildew way

1281
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,800
increases the insides of your buds if

1282
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,039
you're not getting getting some air flow

1283
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,839
in there and you got too much moisture

1284
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,838
in the room that mold is going to grow

1285
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,719
right in the middle of your buds so lock

1286
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,318
yourself in your car one day just lock

1287
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,558
yourself in the car in the Sun and just

1288
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,119
try to sit in there and breathe for the

1289
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,359
whole day that's what it feels like for

1290
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,000
your plants when you just stifle them

1291
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,159
locked up in a tight room that's good

1292
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,239
way to put it yeah so we've stressed the

1293
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:49,838
need for air

1294
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:52,358
exchange uh water water should be easily

1295
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,318
accessible uh I predict that your thou

1296
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:56,279
each thousand watt light will require

1297
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,159
about five gallons of water two to three

1298
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,680
times a week

1299
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:04,838
this works uh across the board I like to

1300
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:07,199
put uh 16 three gallon pots under the

1301
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,159
light or I like to put nine five gallon

1302
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,039
pots or between four and six seven

1303
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,838
gallon pots underneath a th000 watt

1304
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,800
light and either way I find that that

1305
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:19,599
requires about about five gallons of

1306
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,839
water for each watering yeah that's yeah

1307
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,359
that's real good estimate actually yeah

1308
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,639
yeah I'm glad that works out so keep

1309
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:27,358
that in mind that you guys are going to

1310
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:29,279
have to get water to your grow space at

1311
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:32,759
least twice a week unless you set up a

1312
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,119
drip system uh laid in flour and if your

1313
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,720
room is a little hotter you may be

1314
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,280
watering three or four times a week I'm

1315
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,719
hitting my plants is a little cool now

1316
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,640
so I'm hitting them Monday I hit them

1317
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,318
with nutrients real heavy and then I try

1318
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,960
to hit them on Thursday or Friday with

1319
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:46,800
just enough water to keep them through

1320
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,400
Monday but since they haven't been

1321
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,160
drinking a lot that means that on their

1322
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,559
next day when they get just water I'm

1323
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,078
going to really water the [ __ ] out of

1324
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,040
them to kind of wash out any excess

1325
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,640
nutrients that have built up over time

1326
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,639
and then we'll start refeeding the soil

1327
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,879
again

1328
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:02,279
uh around day 30 I really Pummel them

1329
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,000
with a lot of sugars and things yeah and

1330
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,920
smaller plants will use uh water a lot

1331
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,440
more often too dude that mic stand is

1332

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,800

is awesome yeah thank you guys all right

1352
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,079
I feel like we've talked about the very

1353
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,599
basics of building a room we talked

1354
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,318
about setting a goal for how much

1355
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,838
cannabis we need to grow I wrote herb

1356
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:55,199
right here but I corrected myself uh the

1357
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,440
next step is figuring out if you're

1358
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,399
building your room to fit your

1359
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,400
production needs or if you're building

1360
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,039
the room to fit the available space

1361
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,680
budget and electrical

1362
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,279
limitations uh sometimes you can't

1363
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,199
always throw 24 lights in your basement

1364
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,920
because you can't pull that many amps so

1365
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,000
find a happy medium that lets you grow a

1366
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,960
few crops and then uh see if this is

1367
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,079
something that you can dedicate more

1368
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,720
time and space and electricity to and

1369
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,720
then after a couple of crops expand your

1370
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,879
grows plant them out uh but don't expand

1371
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,399
more quickly than you can learn I keep

1372
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,318
saying that imagine this imagine getting

1373
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
ahead of yourself will cause you

1374
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,599
headaches in the future future imagine

1375
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,960
if you have 24 lights in flour with six

1376
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,400
seven gallon pots under each light and

1377
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,000
now you have fungus KNN Nats and it's

1378
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,838
your first grow and you're like four

1379
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
weeks into flour and you can't spray

1380
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,799
because if you spray you're going to put

1381
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,119
[ __ ] in your buds but you got to get rid

1382
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,119
of those fungus snats and you got a

1383
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,559
whole lot of them you just spend if you

1384
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,000
got 24 lights it's like 150

1385
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,519
plants wow uh that should be 24 to 30

1386
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,079
lbs of weed if you do this right some

1387
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,039
guys are going to get 48 lbs of weed out

1388
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,480
of these 24 lights yeah if you're run

1389
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,239
it's oji cush your girl got cookies

1390
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,599
you're hoping for those 25 lbs out of

1391
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,679
that yeah and now you may have to cut it

1392
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,000
down four weeks in you got to do it what

1393
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:10,279
if you got spiderm in there I'm cringing

1394
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,119
so what I'm saying is start small dude

1395
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,079
uh fail small before you fail so large

1396
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,920
because when you grow you're going to

1397
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,200
fail uh I mess up at this rate I still

1398
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,400
kill stuff on accident like all the time

1399
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,960
but that's the only way I learn I

1400
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,480
encourage a little bit of experiment

1401
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,400
don't experiment on your mom's don't

1402
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,639
experiment on your patient important

1403
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,480
crop pick a plant t it see what you can

1404
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,279
do to it

1405
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,960
but go small like experience a few

1406
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,519
problems before you try to battle fungus

1407
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,760
Nats in a 24 light flowering room all

1408
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,119
right we are 47 minutes in I'm not sure

1409
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,480
if we should try to keep going or if we

1410
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,480
should save this next part for another

1411
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,880
episode because we're uh we kind of got

1412
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,000
them on the edge of their seats right

1413
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,519
now yeah we'll talk about we'll talk

1414
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,318
about this one spot right here and then

1415
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,838
uh so we're going to talk a little bit

1416
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:57,599
about room size in relation to how many

1417
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,599
and what type of Lights to use we got

1418
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,280
about 10 minutes to do this so a small

1419
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,160
closet setup uh I would use some small

1420
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,920
T5 lights little fluorescent lights I

1421
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:11,239
personally don't like the coiled CFLs I

1422
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,639
don't feel like they put out enough

1423
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,118
light they work great as supplements if

1424
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,440
it's all you got that's going to if it's

1425
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,280
all you've got and all you can power

1426
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,760
it's going to work but for the amount of

1427
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,040
heat that they put off I don't think

1428
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,839
they put off enough light I I agree

1429
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:27,440
totally awesome uh for a closet I would

1430
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,000
almost recommend it's a t light I think

1431
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,000
there are eight bulbs and I think it's

1432
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,400
24x 24 is the dimensions of it mhm uh

1433
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,960
and I think it's actually made by Hydra

1434
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,119
Farm if you've got a small closet that

1435
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,760
is the perfect light in my opinion uh if

1436
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,760
you can't run a lot of electricity you

1437
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,680
can put that in a small fan and leave

1438
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,559
the closet cracked a little bit you've

1439
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:48,039
got a grow room dude as long as you're

1440
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,359
getting that stale air out of there and

1441
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,358
not letting it get too hot keep the

1442
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:54,199
those T lights right above your plants

1443
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:55,798
and then every night you got to close

1444
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:57,118
that closet door at the same time and

1445
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:58,798
turn off your lights to start your

1446
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,200
flower cycle and you got to be on the

1447
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:03,679
money 8:00 8:00 every day and night but

1448
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:05,598
so in a small closet I think that little

1449
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,000
T5 light I'm talking about as perfect or

1450
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:11,280
maybe a small hid a high-intensity

1451
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,039
discharge light uh maybe like a 150 in a

1452
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,640
closet I really like a 250 watt high

1453
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,159
pressure sodium light I really find

1454
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:18,798
those to be efficient those are cool

1455
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,480
lights it's a great Siz light doesn't

1456
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:24,599
take a lot of wattage but it does make a

1457
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,760
little bit of heat even um you know if

1458
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,640
your closet's a little bigger 400 are

1459
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,280
great that's that's exactly what I wrote

1460
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,639
down I was going to say a 400 is kind of

1461
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,040
the biggest you really want to go in a

1462
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:35,879
closet unless you got like one of those

1463
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,838
fancy like belir walk-in

1464
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,599
closets uh but everyone's got a small

1465
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,279
closet they can dedicate to a grow space

1466
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,000
so if you're just trying to supply herb

1467
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,319
for you and your girlfriend or something

1468
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
or your patient just you the closet is

1469
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:48,318
fine especially with the little T5 light

1470
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,798
I think you could pull some some stuff

1471
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,519
out of a T5 is that where your first

1472
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:55,079
grow was it in a

1473
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,199
closet uh technically yes it was in a

1474
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,240
closet but inside of that closet I put a

1475
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,279
grow Hut in there it was kind of a large

1476
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,959
closet it was more of a was a closet

1477
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,440
that was actually attached to the hot

1478
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,440
water heater area oh the closet had

1479
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,720
another door in it and I actually took

1480
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,720
the ducting from my hot water heater and

1481
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:16,279
my heater and used some of the CO2 uh to

1482
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:20,239
my grow room yeah that can be a little

1483
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,000
dangerous yes that yeah yeah yeah yeah

1484
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,519
don't do that if you don't know what

1485
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,400
you're doing nice uh so yeah perfect

1486
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,759
little closet uh it's a great way to

1487
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,838
grow you can grow a little short plants

1488
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,760
and then you can supply yourself yeah oh

1489
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:35,558
yeah a small corner of a room works if

1490
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,960
you need to like tarp off a room or like

1491
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:38,798
if you have a small room that you can

1492
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,838
just take the corner you can put a grow

1493
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:41,960
Hut in the corner grow Huts are awesome

1494
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,639
I said I'm going to do a whole talk

1495
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,440

listeners are getting drowsy that's what

1506
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,079
I meant to say okay well yeah and I

1507
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,160
don't blame you guys uh so you got that

1508
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,519
small Corner small space you can put a

1509
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:18,239
T5 all the way up to like a 600 watt

1510
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,880
light in like a 6x6 space if you can

1511
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,318
vent it uh we'll talk in the next

up a space and stuff uh in the next

1516
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,880
episode we're going to try to get this

1517
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,119
part done quickly here grow Huts I will

1518
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,680
talk a lot about them uh you can put a

1519
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:38,440
grow Hut in the corner of any room you

1520
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,558
can put multiple grow Huts in a basement

1521
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,559
um you can put one grow Hut in every

1522
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,440
room if you've got limited power find

1523
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,640
out where each room is on each breaker

1524
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,400
and put one grow Hut on each breaker you

1525
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,598
can grow plenty of cannabis in one house

1526
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,798
or one location sounds like my kind of

1527
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:55,160
place I think I've been to houses like

1528
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,000
this uh then of course there's the whole

1529
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,759
dedicated bedroom if you've got a nice

1530
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,400
bedroom that nobody needs if you're a

1531
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,040
single guy and your roommate sucks kick

1532
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,519
him out build a grow room he won't eat

1533
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:07,400
your food he won't bring over ugly

1534
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,880
chicks you got a grow room in there now

1535
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,440
that's going to produce dank cannabis

1536
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,358
and it will pay for itself uh something

1537
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,159
I should write down to talk about is the

1538
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,719
cost of running the grow room because

1539
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:18,519
that's just on my mind huh I had more

1540
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:20,078
paper here and I don't know where the

1541
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:23,358
note I wrote earlier

1542
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,599
went but we'll write that get expensive

1543
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:28,679
uh Big Grow rooms big facilities and

1544
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,240
stuff like that pay astronomical

1545
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,719
electricity bills but imagine if uh if

1546
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:34,118
imagine if you and I were roommates and

1547
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,679
you kicked me out and built a grow room

1548
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:37,599
in my space it would definitely pay for

1549
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,480
itself in the long run oh easily and it

1550
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:44,240
wouldn't eat your freaking bener it

1551
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,240
would get you high as crap in the end so

1552
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,558
a whole room you can put multiple

1553
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,078
depending on the size of your room if

1554
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:53,440
you've got so I say like every 6x6 4x4

1555
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,079
4x4 to 6x6 space you should put about

1556
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,920
1,000 watt light if you can vent it uh

1557
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,720
if you've got a room that's like 10 x 10

1558
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,400
I think you should put 4,000 watt lights

1559
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:03,199
in there yeah uh if you're getting

1560
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,318
bigger and bigger I it kind of depends

1561
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:08,399
on your wattage and stuff but about

1562
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:10,838
every 5x5 Square should be a th000 watt

1563
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,039
light if you can vent that I try to

1564
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:14,639
leave people hate walkways a lot of

1565
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,400
Growers say that walkways are expensive

1566
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,480
and a waste of space I like giving

1567
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,680
myself a walkway so I can get to every

1568
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,639
single plant and I think the plants like

1569
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:23,960
the space to breathe uh you don't like

1570
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,719
being crowded in on the bus with

1571
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,920
everybody touching you your plants don't

1572
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:28,639
like that [ __ ] either give them some

1573
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,119
room to breath and keeping the leaves

1574
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,159
off of each other will prevent powdery

1575
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:36,079
mildew and places for bugs to jump

1576
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:40,039
around so if you've got a whole room put

1577
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,519
a 1,000 watt light every 5x5 space up to

1578
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:44,719
the Limit that your electricity will

1579
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,719
allow and that you can cool um here's a

1580
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,719
random recommendation I think it's about

1581
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,759
3,000 BTUs of cooling for every single

1582
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:55,759
thousand watt light is what I think you

1583
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,440
want 2500 to 3,000 okay so keep that in

1584
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,160
mind when you're and you have to power

1585
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,838
that air conditioner also so in your big

1586
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,558
room here if you've got

1587
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:06,880
uh and you're 30 amp your two 30 amp

1588
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:09,480
Breakers you're going to be able to run

1589
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,640
one maybe two lights and an air

1590
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,318
conditioner that's going to be about it

1591
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,358
yeah on a 30 amp breaker so you're going

1592
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:16,880
to need an uh an electrician to come

1593
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:17,960
wire up your big room yeah you're not

1594
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,720
going to be able to get the air

1595
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,679
conditioner on that most likely uh if

1596
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:24,239
you've got a big garage or a basement

1597
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,960
you need to have the electrician come

1598
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,000
and wire you up with 240 in the whole

1599
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,079
basement

1600
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and then you need to have a mini split

1601
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,640
put in the basement and hang like 24

1602
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,400
lights down there in your basement and

1603
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:39,519
you got to have an H fat guy come set

1604
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,760
that up yeah and yeah they're fun yeah

1605
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,559
that mini split's going to be fun to put

1606
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,280
in but man you can keep it so cool once

1607
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,839
you get it there and then the next step

1608
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,280
up from there uh after you have your

1609
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,880
basement or your big garage with

1610
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,280
multiple thousands uh anything more than

1611
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,920
nine lights I think becomes like kind of

1612
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,040
extensive for a hom grow yeah like yeah

1613
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,079
if you got like 10 lights in a house

1614
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:59,480
you're of pushing it but then you move

1615
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,039
on to like the commercial scale

1616
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,599
warehouses where you've got multiple

1617
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:05,639
rooms with multiple thousand watt lights

1618
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,200
or one giant room with 100 lights in it

1619
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,639
I kind of prefer more separated rooms uh

1620
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:11,199
I like to breed and if something goes

1621
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:13,199
wrong in one room you don't have it

1622
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,039
everywhere it's a little more

1623
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,798
containable so my main point is plan the

1624
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:20,039
room before you start building uh think

1625
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,119
about how many lights you want to run

1626
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:23,038
think about how much cannabis you want

1627
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,798
to produce uh think about your

1628
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,640
electrical limitations think about your

1629
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,038
budget it's going to cost you we said

1630
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,318
about 100 bucks a month to run a light

1631
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,680
and its accessories so keep that in mind

1632
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:34,759
until Harvest you're not going to have

1633
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,199
uh you're going to have to figure out

1634
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,720
how to pay for that once Harvest comes

1635
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,838
then you obviously have a way to pay for

1636
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:41,439
that uh we're going to be at an hour

1637
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,400
real quick here guys this is a good way

1638
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,318
to make this a two-part episode the part

1639
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,079
we're going to come up with next is

1640
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:48,759

1641
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:50,960
