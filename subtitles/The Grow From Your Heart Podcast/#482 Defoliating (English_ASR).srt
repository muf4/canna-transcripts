[Music]

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,149
--scent rate on the podcast before but I

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,100
really like dabbing the Curacao live

12
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,259
batter it does say that it tastes like a

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,329
vanilla fruit chew I don't remember the

14
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,789
description I gave last time I do know

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,770
that I just took a nice low temp dab out

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,750
of a freshly-cleaned rig with a fresh

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,180
brand new nail and it tastes a little

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,558
bit like a candy corn now people are

19
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,448
gonna say that's gross because I don't

20
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,219
like candy corns but imagine if you

21
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:07,170
could eat a candy corn and not have to

22
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,478
taste that waxy [ __ ] that comes with

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,920
it so without that waxy [ __ ] I think a

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,319
candy corn would taste really delicious

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,850
it's got that vanilla candy flavor it's

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,489
got a hint of a fruity flavor at the end

27
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,158
and this Curacao live batter left a

28
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,618
really nice sweet vanilla flavor on my

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,509
tongue and I am absolutely enjoying it

30
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,118
so big shout out to our friends at green

31

this episode I am going to do a little

35
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,368
talk about defoliation we will talk

36
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,868
about why I do it we will talk about

37
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,030
when to do it and we will talk a little

38
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,188
bit about how to do it but before we get

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,070

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
to learn how to support the show you can

64
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,919
do so by visiting

65
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:55,520
www.azcleanelections.gov plants a lot of

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,590
growers have a lot of opinions on

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,439
defoliating cannabis plants in this

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,900
episode i will tell you when and how to

69
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,569
properly defoliate your cannabis plants

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,780
before I do that part let me explain to

71
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,060
you why I feel like defoliation is a

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,250
good idea maybe I should start by

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,670
basically explaining what do I mean by

74
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,159
defoliation I mean taking off excessive

75
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,139
leaves in your grow room any leaves that

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
are too large that are blocking light

77
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,519
they may become a problem in the future

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,680
I take those leaves off early and flower

79
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,500
if not late into the vegetative cycle

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,200
and I do this for several reasons my

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,930
first reason is to allow light to

82
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,089
penetrate my canopy and get to potential

83
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,730
bud sites and bud sites for better

84
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,450
growth and bud development our main goal

85
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:47,310
is to grow big potent quality buds if we

86
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,289
can remove some leaf and put some of the

87
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,060
light on more of the buds spend more of

88
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:52,979
the energy on growing buds and less

89
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,150
energy on growing leaf we have the

90
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,939
potential to increase the overall

91
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,219
harvest weight and the overall quality

92
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,099
of our product so I like to take off

93
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,900
excess leaf to get more light into the

94
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,019
canopy more light to the buds and

95
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,469
potential bud sites I also like to

96
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,810
remove excess leaf to allow more airflow

97
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,960
I work in large scale commercial

98
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,238
environments airflow is important on any

99
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,280
size of scale you are growing but it

100
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,589
gets much more critical as we get into

101
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,049
larger environments and larger rooms and

102
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,479
larger buildings by removing excessive

103
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,199
foliage we can create better airflow

104
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,750
throughout the

105
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,219
entire grow room creating better airflow

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,379
through the environment will have

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,440
several advantages this will help us

108
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,240
regulate humidity in the grow room being

109
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,250
able to regulate humidity in the grow

110
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,740
room will help us prevent issues like

111
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,259
bud rot this will also help us prevent

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,420
issues like powdery mildew so by

113
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,810
removing excess leaf we help to reduce

114
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,060
humidity we also have less opportunity

115
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,699
for things like powdery mildew we also

116
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,980
give ourselves less opportunity for bud

117
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,709
rot now when we remove all those excess

118
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,590
leaves we also give ourselves less

119
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,299
opportunity for pests if you don't have

120
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:08,159
a bunch of leaves if you don't have a

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,579
bunch of excessive foliage there are

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,920
less places for bugs to hide it makes it

123
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,569
much easier to treat for pests if you do

124
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,879
have a problem it makes it much easier

125
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,949
to spray preventative sprays to make

126
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,779
sure you don't get a problem and when

127
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,909
your defoliating if you do have a

128
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,639
problem you will absolutely notice a

129
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,040
pest infestation while you're doing the

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,399
defoliation work now those are three

131
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,770
basic obvious advantages of defoliating

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,049
are cannabis plants and like I've said

133
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:39,299
before this becomes more necessary as we

134
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,270
increase the size of our grow spaces and

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,819
the number of plants I also think that

136
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:47,579
strategic defoliation will heavily

137
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,560
increase the productivity of the plants

138
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,769
and will also increase the overall

139
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,810
product harvest weight and potency so

140
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:58,169
there will be several advantages here it

141
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,910
will also make trimming much easier this

142
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,620
will speed up the trim crew yes we did

143
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,300
spend a few days in the growth peeling

144
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,340
off leaves before the trim crew ever got

145
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,550
to it but this will speed them up that

146
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,979
is that many less leaves that make it to

147
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,230
the harvest phase so that is why I

148
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,600
defoliate know a lot of people have this

149
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,110
mentality that the leaves are what hold

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,700
the nutrients bro we feed the [ __ ] out

151
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,430
of these plants we are spending a lot of

152
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,539
money on nutrients we are feeding

153
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,819
high-quality nutrients we are mixing up

154
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,770
high quality soils and soil assess and

155
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,480
we are feeding that to our plants they

156
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,769
are getting fed plenty they are not out

157
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,060
in the wilderness trying to survive

158
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:35,189
they're not homeless they're getting

159
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,780
taken care of they don't need those

160
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,639
excessive leaves you know what is going

161
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,349
to eat from those leaves spider mites

162
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,939
that's who's gonna live there that's

163
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,140
who's gonna feed off of that [ __ ]

164
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,000
let's get rid of that let's help

165
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,439
ourselves out I've said it in a previous

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,439
episode I'm going to keep saying it

167
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,709
let's set ourselves up for success so

168
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,459
again in my opinion proper strategic

169
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:58,409
defoliation can have many great benefits

170
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:01,439
now let's move toward talking about how

171
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,100
I do my defoliation there are a couple

172
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,569
of very important steps to preparing for

173
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,520
a proper defoliation session one

174
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:13,529
requirement is good music you need

175
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,229
proper music for a proper defoliation

176
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:18,479
session in a commercial environment you

177
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,360
can get tunnel vision you've got a large

178
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,550
room and very long rows that I tell four

179
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,040
or five guys hey your whole goal for

180
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,930
today is to D foliate this room give it

181
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,939
like a level three defoliation don't

182
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,319
strip it don't be a [ __ ] but get in

183
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,000
there and pull off a bunch of leaves I

184
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,589
want a bunch of 5-gallon buckets where

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,779
the leaves coming out of here get in

186
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,639
there and defoliate what will happen is

187
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,879
the guys will take a little break that's

188
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,709
another one of the requirements if it is

189
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,439
acceptable for you to medicate you've

190
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:48,569
got to get baked before you D foliate so

191
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,459
if that's your thing get plenty baked

192
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,870
then put on good music then the next

193
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,239
thing that I'm going to say you need is

194
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,350
gloves if you're defoliating take me

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,269
seriously on this one

196
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,580
you always need gloves when you were

197
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,109
defoliating plants but let's get back to

198
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,180
this music part why do I want people to

199
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,250
have good music on because the guys in

200
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,259
the big grow tend to get a little bit of

201
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,540
tunnel vision and they will work on one

202
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,980
area of the grow room really heavily and

203
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,990
they will forget to move to the next

204
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,810
table so you'll have 20 tables in the

205
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,870
room two of them will be very well D

206
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,189
foliated the other 18 need a lot of work

207
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,470
they got ignored they forgot they were

208
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,089
there so I tell the guys put on a song

209
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,070
if you're gonna put in ear buds do that

210
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,049
if you're gonna put on the big Bluetooth

211
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,790
speaker that everybody can hear do that

212
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,290
but put on some music put on some

213
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,639
regular music don't listen to fish or

214
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,899
the Grateful Dead because this technique

215
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,519
won't work with fish are the Grateful

216
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,468
Dead their songs are way too long

217
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,509
put on your Pandora or whatever you're

218
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,789
playing today and just let it play and

219
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,830
at the end of each song move down a few

220
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,419
feet or move down to the next table just

221
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,070
know that by the end of the day you've

222
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,929
got to get this whole room done and

223
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,850
don't get too stuck on one table that's

224
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,588
why I tell the guys put on music and

225
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,230
then move after each song just go to

226
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,980
another section move down move six feet

227
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,528
move to another

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,240
Table does make progress every song now

229
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:02,939
the reason I tell them to do that is

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,250
because I don't want them to strip one

231
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,470
section really heavily and then we have

232
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,419
to come back tomorrow and strip a couple

233
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,269
more sections really heavily I would

234
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,009
rather them strip the entire room really

235
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,959
lightly and then we'll come back in a

236
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:18,179
few days and we'll do the entire room

237
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,578
really lightly that way I don't have

238
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,439
like I keep saying section one tables

239
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:24,838
one two and three are butt naked there's

240
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,389
no leaves over here but tables 4 through

241
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,740
20 are coated and leaves still and it's

242
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,419
all furry we're gonna have different

243
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,980
humidity we're gonna have problems in

244
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,088
the room things are not consistent I

245
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,159
like consistency

246
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,410
I like uniformity in the grow it makes

247
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,819
things easy so I tell the guys go

248
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,009
through and give it all a level-one

249
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,180
strip most of the time the guys nail it

250
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,559
because they know what I expect from

251
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,359
them by now they've been trained pretty

252
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,129
well but they usually go through and

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,750
they give it a nice little strip they

254
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,429
don't strip and tour they're naked they

255
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,720
don't they aren't too [ __ ] about it and

256
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,609
leave too many leaves and leave it real

257
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,009
furry they know right where to go take

258
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,810
off those leaves but if I do want it a

259
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,338
little bit more I just saw him go back

260
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:00,629
through and just do another quick strip

261
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,550
and they can just go through and do

262
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,708
another quick strip that way they don't

263
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:06,509
go too hard that way they don't take too

264
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,489
many leaves off you can always take more

265
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:11,009
leaves off but you can never put more

266
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,919
leaves back on so that's another great

267
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:16,470
segue you will be amazed at how quickly

268
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,689
these leaves grow back and replace

269
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,129
themselves depending on your grow

270
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,470
environment depending on your genetics

271
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:24,539
and depending on your nutrients you may

272
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,870
cut off these leaves and in four or five

273
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,969
days the plant will be twice as leafy as

274
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,500
it was before and that's a good sign

275
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,350
that is showing that that plant is

276
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,089
productive and that it is growing that

277
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,069
also means that in four or five maybe

278
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,990
six or seven days we have to get back in

279
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:42,269
there and pull those leaves off again

280
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,629
but we're not there yet we are still on

281
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,730
the first layer of defoliation in most

282
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,409
cases I would recommend no matter what

283
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,269
size your girl environment is if you're

284
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:53,549
working in a 4x4 tent or if you're in a

285
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,948
hundred light room I would recommend

286
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:58,169
starting with a light nice even

287
00:10:55,948 --> 00:11:00,479
defoliation then I would go back and

288
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:03,120
defoliate every few days and light

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,740
phases now if you're new and you're just

290
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,959
learning how to do this you may want to

291
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,459
pick one plant and defoliate the living

292
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,809
[ __ ] out of it you might want to pick

293
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,698
another plant and go

294
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,979
kind of hard then pick another one and

295
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:15,778
go medium then pick another one and go

296
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,240
real light and then pick another one and

297
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,399
don't defoliation then treat those

298
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,198
plants exactly the same otherwise and

299
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,659
see how you like the results does the

300
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:26,188
plant that you D foliated all the way

301
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,838
does that one grow better than the one

302
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,490
that you didn't defoliate you will

303
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,589
notice differences if you do tests like

304
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,139
that and I am skipping ahead on my notes

305
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:37,379
a little bit here but defoliation will

306
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,778
be very strain specific it will also

307
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,759
depend on your lighting your nutrients

308
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,948
and your overall grow environment if

309
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,720
your plants are getting a lot of light

310
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:47,698
and a lot of quality nutrients you're

311
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,559
going to see a lot of production if

312
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:51,479
you're under smaller lights or your

313
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:54,240
plants are lacking in nutrition you may

314
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,850
not see as rapid leaf development so

315
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,980
defoliation will depend heavily on your

316
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,749
environment but I'm skipping ahead so

317
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,028
let me keep myself on track here let's

318
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,470
talk about defoliating your grow

319
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,149
environment let's just say maybe you've

320
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,769
got a five by five you've got one light

321
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,629
in there the plants are looking great

322
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,519
they may be in a trellis they may have

323
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:13,620
sticks holding them up they may not have

324
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,769
any supports this will work for just

325
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,610
about any type of situation this is my

326
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,828
strategy for defoliation weight in the

327
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,110
veg cycle I like to pull all the crap

328
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:27,088
off the bottom of the plants any little

329
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,339
sucker branches any little leaves that

330
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,649
look like [ __ ] I really clean the plants

331
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,500
up about two weeks before they go into

332
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:36,958
flower I don't necessarily bottom and

333
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,899
lollipop the plants in veg I will leave

334
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,479
most of the branches on I mainly do just

335
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,129
a defoliation and kind of a those little

336
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,420
sucker branches that are only a quarter

337
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,459
of an inch long and they're just kind of

338
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,318
starting to develop I pull all that crap

339
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,388
off the bottom anything that the light

340
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:53,278
isn't going to reach I will take all

341
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,079
that crap off the bottom we don't need

342
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,938
that that is going to help the energy

343
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,278
move to the top of the plants and those

344
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:01,230
tops can grow and get bigger and beefier

345
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,049
that's where we're gonna get our big fat

346
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,539
buds so my defoliation will start late

347
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,818
in veg about two weeks maybe a week

348
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,639
before we go into flower again depending

349
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:14,188
on the strain and the environment so my

350
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,959
plant may be 12 inches tall coming out

351
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:17,730
of the pot everything on the bottom

352
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,469
three or four inches of that plant are

353
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,870
going to get cleaned up pretty well all

354
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,519
of the little starts and sucker shoots

355
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,990
that are sticking out off those branch

356
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,519
I'm just gonna clean those off I'll

357
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,080
leave the ends of the branches there and

358
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,278
leave all the foliage up the ends of the

359
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,259
branches but I'm just gonna clean off

360
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,820
the bottoms so that the bottoms of the

361
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,289
plants are nice and clean we don't have

362
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,879
a lot of leaf area down there we don't

363
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,338
have a lot of sucker branches down there

364
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,200
wasting nutrients wasting energy and not

365
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,000
getting any light that part's not gonna

366
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,649
grow for you let's just clean it right

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,750
off of there now this will start sending

368
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,919
energy up to the tops of the plants the

369
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,750
plants are gonna start growing a little

370
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,269
more quickly they're getting ready to go

371
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,669
into flower so the first day I put them

372
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:56,730
into flower is when my defoliation

373
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:59,269
really starts to begin on day one a

374
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,649
flower I like to begin a very strategic

375
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,708
defoliation now what do I mean by

376
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:07,110
strategic I want to remove the biggest

377
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:10,409
leaves in the room those are probably my

378
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,539
first targets I generally remove any

379
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:15,269
leaves that are blocking light from

380
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:17,429
getting to a bud site if you've got a

381
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:20,730
branch that will develop buds on it and

382
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:22,588
that branch is being blocked by a leaf

383
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,350
and not being allowed to get sufficient

384
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,839
light you can pull that leaf off and let

385
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,050
the light get to the bud site we want to

386
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,329
grow more buds not more leaves so any

387
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,699
leaves that are acting like an umbrella

388
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:38,069
that are shadowing buds or bud sites

389
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,770
below them I will remove those big

390
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,230
leaves one thing I tell the guys in the

391
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,350
commercial facilities is take off any

392
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,089
leaf with the purple stem if you've got

393
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,040
a big leaf about the size of your hand

394
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:52,800
and it's got a little purple stem on it

395
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,588
that leaf can go we don't need that leaf

396
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,778
on the plant but I do make a couple of

397
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,880
exceptions I like to leave the leaves at

398
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,439
the very tops of the plants if you've

399
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,299
got a couple of colas that are sticking

400
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,459
up at the top you will always see me

401
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,458
leave the leaves at the very tops of

402
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,708
those buds on there I don't know if that

403
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,869
is a visual thing for me I don't know if

404
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,669
that's an OCD thing something in me

405
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,009
makes me think that the plants want

406
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:19,019
those first few leaves at the top if

407
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:20,549
they are not blocking a lot of light

408
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,039
from getting to the lower parts of the

409
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,629
canopy I will leave those I think they

410
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,149
look really good and something in me

411
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,509
feels weird when I remove just those top

412
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:33,000
two or four big leaves from the top main

413
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,828
buds and again that is just something

414
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,809
inside of me that is something that the

415
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:37,199
plant says to me I have no science

416
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,969
behind

417
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,980
that is a personal thing that I have

418
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,840
noticed it feels weird to me to take off

419
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,360
those top leaves I will leave those on

420
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,370
until just before harvest it will take

421
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,620
those leaves off at the very end but

422
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,870
that is my one weird exception when it

423
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,210
comes to defoliating I like to take off

424
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,700
most of those giant leaves I will start

425
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,860
by removing every leaf with a purple pea

426
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,990
deol then if you want to dial in your

427
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,879
defoliation for optimal light

428
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,710
penetration here is a very good

429
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,929
technique and this depends on the

430
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,540
quality and power of the light which you

431
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:10,859
are using if you're using thousand watt

432
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,929
lights your lights are going to

433
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,659
penetrate the canopy much more deeply

434
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,789
than if you're using a 400 watt light so

435
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,039
your defoliation will depend again on

436
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:22,469
your lighting and your environment so

437
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,449
what you can do I like to put my hand in

438
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,460
the canopy just reach right into the

439
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,740
middle of the canopy and see is the

440
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,690
light hitting my hand and if the light

441
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,509
isn't getting to my hand what leaves

442
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,740
above my hand are blocking it then if I

443
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,779
feel like the light should be getting

444
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,149
that far into the canopy I will remove

445
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,549
the leaves that are in the way that are

446
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,259
not allowing that light to get down to

447
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:45,329
those bud sites that I want to get nice

448
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,100
and fat so if you've got any leaves

449
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,990
acting like an umbrella that are

450
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,940
covering up a bud site just feel free to

451
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,700
pull them off that will be very

452
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,980
beneficial to that bud site below now

453
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,410
you do have to consider the power of

454
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,420
that light what type of penetration do

455
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:03,000
you realistically expect from that light

456
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,129
we can only defoliate so heavily to

457
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,199
allow more penetration we may need to

458
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,150
remove stuff from the bottom because it

459
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,100
is not going to get light no matter how

460
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,199
many leaves we remove but we're gonna

461
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,759
talk about that in a future episode when

462
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,350
we talk about bottoming and Lolly

463
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,078
popping and popping and twisting the

464
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,849
plants let's stay focused here on

465
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,529
defoliation so if you've got a thousand

466
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,299
watt light and it's a few inches above

467
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:26,519
the plants and you feel like that light

468
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,559
should probably penetrate 18 to 24

469
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,230
inches into the canopy put your arm in

470
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,389
there about 18 inches in so you've got

471
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,309
your 6 to 12 inches from the light is

472
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,290
the top of your canopy and then go down

473
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,569
another 18 inches and that's where we're

474
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,039
hoping to get light penetration is the

475
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,960
light touching your hand are there a

476
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,920
bunch of shadows over your hand move

477
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,059
your hand you're gonna have to move

478
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,980
around branches and you're gonna have to

479
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,109
do some adjusting but move around are

480
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,480
you getting light on your hand if not

481
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,129
you can probably defoliate a little bit

482
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,798
now I've said this at the start of the

483
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,110
episode don't go in there and crazily

484
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,730
defoliate I don't know how leafy your

485
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,109
plants are I don't know what genetics

486
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,700
you're growing I don't know what type of

487
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:03,898
nutrients you're using I don't know what

488
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,610
kind of light you've got I don't know

489
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:07,558
what kind of VPD you're working with

490
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,939
I don't know how leafy you're starting

491
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:12,089
with and I don't know how the plants are

492
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,700
going to react so go light go in there

493
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:16,138
and just do a level-one defoliation I

494
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,308
don't know how big your room is so I

495
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,808
don't even know how many leaves you

496
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:20,609
should expect to pull out of there just

497
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,720
go pull a bunch of leaves and just look

498
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:24,178
in there and say does it look like I've

499
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,009
done anything and it probably won't just

500
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,440
leave it right there you'll be okay

501
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,599
see how the plants react then in two or

502
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,250
three days do it again and just keep

503
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,048
doing it until you think huh those look

504
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,210
a little bit bare once you start

505
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:38,158
thinking they kind of almost look like I

506
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,798
took too much off that's probably right

507
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,440
where you want to be but again you can

508
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,230
always take off more leaf we cannot glue

509
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,450
the leaves back onto the plants so let's

510
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,759
take off a few leaves here on day one if

511
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,830
you are new wait a few days

512
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,480
maybe three maybe five days and do a

513
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,879
visual inspection if you're comfortable

514
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,919
with taking off more leaves do that and

515
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,470
repeat that process until you are

516
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,990
comfortable with the art of defoliating

517
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,659
now once you are comfortable with it

518
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,630
I recommend a defoliation at the start

519
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:11,159
of week one we'll go semi-hard at week

520
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,720
one cuz we want to clean up we haven't

521
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,549
taken any leaves off it's a big thick

522
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,110
jungle a mess we got to get in there and

523
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,940
shave her up for the very first time and

524
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,928
make her look good week one we're gonna

525
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,240
go semi-hard

526
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:23,340
week three we're just gonna go back and

527
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,990
kind of clean up what is regrown then

528
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,638
again at week five we're starting to get

529
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,470
bud sites we can see where all the buds

530
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:30,449
are gonna be this is when I will clean

531
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,399
off any of the small sucker branches

532
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,500
that I'm sure are not gonna make it into

533
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:36,359
anything anything they got left behind

534
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,888
on previous cleanings and bottoming

535
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,439
'he's that's all gonna get removed at

536
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:44,308
this point and again I will do a medium

537
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,860
heavy defoliation around week five then

538
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,589
I'm going to go back around week seven

539
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,689
and I'm going to do the final

540
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:54,000
defoliation now this one is fun because

541
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,038
we are getting big sticky buds at this

542
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,500
time your arms are gonna get sticky your

543
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,089
shirts gonna get sticky wear proper

544
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,669
gloves and clothing

545
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:04,408
I really recommend long sleeve shirts

546
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,950
when you're in there defoliating because

547
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,660
when that red

548
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,549
start sticking to your arm here it

549
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,200
really becomes uncomfortable and it is

550
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,139
really a [ __ ] to get off if you don't

551
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,610
know grower tricks so on week one we're

552
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,860
going to get in there and we're going to

553
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:18,479
remove everything with a purple PDL

554
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:20,849
we're going to use our hand to reach

555
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,250
into the canopy and see if the light is

556
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:25,409
reaching our hand or our arm if it's not

557
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,269
we'll remove a few more leaves to try to

558
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,759
make that light get to those lower bud

559
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,690
sights if you're a new grower and you're

560
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,539
not comfortable with a strong

561
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,070
defoliation do a light defoliation and

562
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,690
pay attention to the plants and then

563
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:38,339
keep pulling leaves as you feel

564
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,980
comfortable and you will gain confidence

565
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,109
as you go when that plant doesn't die

566
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,180
and you see it increased productivity

567
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,740
because of your pulling of leaves you

568
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,750
will gain confidence and you will want

569
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,430
to go in there and remove more leaves

570
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,660
and then you will find that balance one

571
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,970
day you'll pull too many and you'll go

572
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,160
oh I pissed it off so get in there and

573
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,720
experiment and learn the balance once

574
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,509
you get comfortable we'll do a hard

575
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,160
strip on week one then on week three we

576
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,839
go back and we clean up the stuff that

577
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,310
it started to grow back we are starting

578
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,319
to see where the bud sites are popping

579
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,990
up at this point we have probably

580
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,089
bottomed and lollipop the plants so you

581
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,980
know how far your bud sites are going to

582
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:15,659
be up on the plant you know how far you

583
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,339
expect the penetration from the light to

584
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,560
get into the canopy so now we've got a

585
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:21,990
really good idea of what needs to be

586
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,359
defoliated so week three you will have a

587
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,740
lot of confidence and a lot of tips from

588
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,619
the environment and the plants

589
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,230
themselves on what to defoliate then on

590
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,149
week five that is a fun one we get to go

591
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,860
in there and we see all the buds getting

592
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,780
chunky and now we can see the leaves

593
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,609
that are obvious over the bud sites a

594
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,930
lot more leaves have grown back some of

595
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:42,029
the older leaves have gotten bigger

596
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,250
let's take off all the crap that is

597
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:47,639
blocking the light while you're doing

598
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:50,609
every defoliation carefully look for

599
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,560
bugs carefully look for issues that is

600
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,639
part of the job when you're defoliating

601
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,950
when you're doing anything with the

602
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,070
plants the secondary task on your mind

603
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,600
is looking for issues so on week five we

604
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:02,129
go in there and we pull out all the big

605
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,949
leaves that are covering up bud sites

606
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,930
then on week seven we are getting ready

607
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,240
for harvest we've only got maybe one

608
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,310
maybe three more weeks at the most until

609
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,920
we're going to harvest these plants you

610
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,889
may be beginning to see yellow leaves

611
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,140
absolutely remove those as soon as

612
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,600
possible at week seven I

613
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,700
like to take off the majority of the big

614
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,230
leaves I keep saying go slowly by this

615
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,500
point we're going to go in there and

616
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,390
pull off most of the leaves then a day

617
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,720
or two before harvest I send the trim

618
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:36,030
crew in and they do a pre harvest strip

619
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,009
they take off all of the giant leaves

620
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,079
and they will also take off a lot of the

621
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:43,740
sugar leaves and I didn't mention this

622
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:46,409
before 99% of this defoliation is done

623
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,569
by hand we are not using scissors just

624
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,029
grab the leaf and just pop it right off

625
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,159
it will come off some of the guys are so

626
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,960
quick that it is scary I'm gonna hit the

627
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,590
microphone and the speed that these guys

628
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,360
pull leaves it sounds like this and they

629
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,099
just go you tell him one two three go

630
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,479
and they've got good music on and

631
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,039
they're nice and motivated and they know

632
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,960
the job and they know how long it takes

633
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,940
so they just get in there and go once

634
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,340
you get good at it you will be a d

635
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,750
foliation monster you just use your

636
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,119
thumb to kind of grab that leaf and just

637
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,559
pop it right off of there over time once

638
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,750
you get comfortable and develop

639
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,549
experience you will also develop a lot

640
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,829
of confidence and you will start to see

641
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,480
the results of your defoliation and he

642
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:27,629
will start to learn how to dial it in

643
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,660
for each strain now some strains may not

644
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,000
react super well to defoliation the

645
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,310
strains that don't have a lot of leaves

646
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,079
may not respond well to a heavy

647
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:39,720
defoliation you're going to have to

648
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:42,059
learn to be plant specific when it comes

649
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,890
to tricks like this but as long as you

650
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,700
understand the main goal and you don't

651
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:49,320
go too hard you will become very good at

652
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,450
defoliating your cannabis garden in no

653
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,250
time so the main idea here is just take

654
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,200
off all the extra leaves and you will

655
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,599
start to identify what those extra

656
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,670
leaves are it is very easy to identify

657
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,899
anything with a long purple PDL just

658
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,300
take that right out of there we don't

659
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,920
need it now we've got a bunch of leaves

660
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,419
at the end what are we going to do with

661
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,360
all of these leaves that is a great

662
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,490
question some people choose to juice

663
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,500
their leaves now if you were spraying

664
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,269
any type of pesticide please do not

665
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,190
juice your leaves please do not give

666
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,500
them to anybody to be juiced if you've

667
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,480
sprayed pesticides or essential oils do

668
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,410
not do that we don't want to juice that

669
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,700
[ __ ] a lot of people use their leaves in

670
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,050
compost if you've got a way to compost

671
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,460
your leaves that is a great way to get

672
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,529
rid of them if you're running a no-till

673
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,569
garden if you're doing recycled beds

674
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:34,129
just throw those leaves

675
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,619
right into the compost right into the

676
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,510
recycled soil beds or you can just drop

677
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,579
them right into the no-till garden and

678
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,650
then they will decompose and they will

679
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,509
become energy and food for your plants

680
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,720
and for your worms now if you were going

681
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:50,809
to throw away these leaves be very

682
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,120
careful it looks extremely suspicious to

683
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:55,220
see a trash bag with pot leaves in it

684
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,750
sitting out by the curb when you're

685
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,610
waiting for the trash man to pick it up

686
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,109
now just imagine you take that bag of

687
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:02,119
trash out there and it's super fine but

688
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:03,889
then some punk-ass kid comes by and he's

689
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,329
on his bike and he hits the trash bag

690
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,680
with his bike and the pegs go right

691
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,879
through the bag and now your trash bags

692
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,279
open and now right in front of your

693
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,930
house is a bunch of weed leaves

694
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,019
depending on where you are it only takes

695
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,299
one leaf to cause giant problems for

696
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:19,009
yourself and your future so be very

697
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,379
careful with what you do with these

698
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,210
leaves once they're defoliated think

699
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,220
about that overall when you're growing

700
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,230
what are you going to do with all of the

701
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,880
trash are you going to compost it do you

702
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,799
have a wood chipper what is going to

703
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,630
happen to all that stuff how are you

704
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,299
going to get rid of it safely and not

705
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,530
get yourself into any trouble I feel

706
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,599
like I've covered the basics of

707
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:41,299
defoliation basically you take the

708
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,699
leaves off strategically I like to do it

709
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,529
at the start of week one of flower the

710
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,630
start of week three the start of week

711
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:51,319
five the start of week seven and then I

712
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,900
even do a pre harvest defoliation you'll

713
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:57,109
have to learn your plant specifics on

714
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,930
how hard to defoliate these plants the

715
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:02,299
main goal is to remove excess leaves to

716
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,430
make more room for light to penetrate

717
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,470
the canopy also that will help control

718
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,900
your humidity that is also going to help

719
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,000
prevent things like powdery mildew and

720
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,660
bud rot and we're also going to make

721
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,299
less hangout spaces less party zones for

722
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,850
pests like spider mites and thrips so I

723
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,319
hope that explains defoliation when I

724
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:23,689
work in a commercial environment

725
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:26,179
the day after ID foliate I generally do

726
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,410
some popping and twisting so in a future

727
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,390
episode we're going to have to talk

728
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,370
about popping and twisting and we will

729
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,740
also talk about bottoming and lolli

730
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:36,199
popping our ganja plants for increased

731
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,700
production ladies and gentlemen this was

732

I woke up one morning in November and I

819
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:14,899
realized I love you it's not your

820
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:19,970
headlights in front your tailpipe for

821
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:23,480
the skylight above you it's the way you

822
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:30,140
cling to the road when the wind tries to

823
00:32:23,480 --> 00:33:12,098
shove you I'd never go driving away

825
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:21,220
the tires are the things on your car

826
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,220
that make

827
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,660
on your car

828
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,769
the car

829
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,340
back to our

830
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:46,209
I'm a contract

831
00:33:47,460 --> 00:34:12,980
