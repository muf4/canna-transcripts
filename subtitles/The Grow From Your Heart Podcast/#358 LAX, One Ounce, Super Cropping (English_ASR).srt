00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
welcome to the show everybody it's time

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,059
for episode 358 of the growth from your

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,280
heart podcast thank you for joining me

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,589
this episode is brought to you by the

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,299
holiday exceed company if you need new

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,160
genetics for your garden I highly

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,219
recommend the hella dank seed company

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,948
and you can find them at dank seed dot

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,689
store I like to start the show by

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,390
letting you know what I am smoking on

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,028
today I'm taking dabs of lemon tea

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,969
pucker number one live resin batter from

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:33,119
7/10 labs this stuff smells very

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:35,460
familiar at the last dude grows cup Moby

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,979
dill gave me a bud that I'm pretty sure

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,719
he said was a lemon pucker and I think

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,238
he told me the cross on that was

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,558
Jillybean and lemon g and that would

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,259
make great sense because this

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,320
concentrate certainly has lemon G in it

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,448
it's got that greasy funky lemon citrusy

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,730
Terp to it and then at the end it's got

23
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,409
that sweet white grapes going on which I

24
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,049
really think comes from the Jilly bean

25
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,988
so I think the cross on this is lemon G

26
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,939
and Jillybean but I can't be certain one

27
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,308
thing I am certain of is it tastes

28
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,469
amazing and it has got me super high and

29
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,989
super rambley so this should be a great

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,819
podcast you guys I've been working my

31
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,530
way through a long series of grow

32
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,269
lessons just a heads up at the beginning

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,099
here I'm going to take a break from the

34
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,688
lessons on this episode but I'll get

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,209
right back into the grow talk on the

36
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,889
next episode on this episode we're gonna

37
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,559
read some emails we're gonna give some

38
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,460
shoutouts but first let's start with a

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,219
little update from LAX what that's right

40
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,989
LA International Airport put out a press

41
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,560
release recently and we'll just jump

42
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:40,140
right into it this is what it says LAX

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,629
marijuana policy while federal law

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,849
prohibits the possession of marijuana

45
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:46,649
inclusive a federal airspace

46
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:50,519
california's passage of proposition 64

47
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,368
effective january 1st 2018 allows for

48
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,170
individuals 21 years of age or older to

49
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,780
possess up to twenty eight point five

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,728
grams of marijuana and 8 grams of

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,939
concentrated marijuana for personal

52
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,950
consumption in accordance with prop 64

53
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,750
the Los Angeles Airport Police

54
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,300
Department will allow passengers to

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,219
travel through LAX with up to

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,210
twenty-eight point five grams of

57
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,580
marijuana

58
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,760
eight grams of concentrated marijuana

59
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,370
however passengers should be aware that

60
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,199
marijuana was very state-by-state and

61
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,140
they are encouraged to check with the

62
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,109
laws of the states in which they plan to

63
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,369
travel so lax the Los Angeles

64
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,470
International Airport

65
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,020
has released their official cannabis

66
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:36,840
policy they will let you leave with 28

67
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,270
point five grams of cannabis and 8 grams

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,069
of concentrates the statement did not

69
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,900
include anything about what they would

70
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,789
do if you tried to travel with more so

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,039
just don't do that wherever you're going

72
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,900
and how it should be enough an ounce and

73
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,900
8 grams of concentrates should be plenty

74
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,670
for a short trip anyway the second half

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,770
of their statement was a reminder that

76
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,659
it is your responsibility to understand

77
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,180
the legality of cannabis in your

78
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,439
destination wherever you are landing you

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,569
need to know the rules and laws

80
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,259
regarding medical and/or recreational

81
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,599
cannabis in that state some states have

82
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,639
a reciprocal medical marijuana program

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,129
if you are a medical marijuana patient

84
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,689
in one state and you fly to these states

85
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,729
that allow out-of-state medical

86
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,439
marijuana patients to have access to

87
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,869
medical marijuana there you should be

88
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,759
just fine if you are flying to a state

89
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,740
that does not allow cannabis just be

90
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,539
careful you are probably going to pick

91
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,550
up your luggage and leave the airport

92
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,560
now you were just in civilization with

93
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,450
cannabis and a prohibition state act

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,219
accordingly now here's something to

95
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,469
think about perhaps you've got to

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,330
transfer planes perhaps you're like our

97
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:40,620
friend white Mike who as soon as he gets

98
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,940
off the plane the first thing he's

99
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,300
thinking about is getting a cigarette

100
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:47,250
into his lungs don't run out of the

101
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,840
airport go smoke a cigarette and then

102
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,819
have to go back through security and

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,860
Dallas Texas where they're not going to

104
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,139
be cannabis friendly keep stuff like

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,810
that in mind if you were traveling with

106
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,309
your products lax didn't care that you

107
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,900
had an ounce of Earth 8 grams of

108
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,789
concentrates but when you make that

109
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,280
transfer in Kansas City or in Chicago

110
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:07,139
are they going to be ok with that stuff

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,810
you've got in your backpack plan ahead

112
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,089
and pay attention and you should be ok I

113
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,469
was talking to a comedian friend of mine

114
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,539
who travels with cannabis quite

115
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,220
frequently and I was asking him how he

116
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,199
feels so comfortable just putting his

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,060
weed and his carry-on and flying across

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,108
the country and he said dude the TSA

119
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,389
does not care

120
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,529
the TSA told him specifically they're

121
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,419
not looking for can

122
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,699
miss cannabis doesn't hurt anybody on a

123
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,590
plane weapons and bombs hurt people on

124
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,599
planes so they don't care about cannabis

125
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,549
at all so most of the time they don't

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,530
give a [ __ ] of course there are those

127
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,389
TSA agents that want to be heroes if

128
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,859
they find a little something on you they

129
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,509
want to call the police they want to

130
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,220
call airport security so always be

131
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,129
prepared for dip shits in the world like

132
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,250
that but for the most part the TSA does

133
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,449
not care about your ganja in your bag so

134
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,459
that was a statement from the Los

135
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,899
Angeles International Airport

136
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,388
I like that they've made it clear not

137
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,459
only for travelers but also for airport

138
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,550
security now you have less opportunity

139
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,219
for rogue TSA agents to try to cause you

140
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,710
a problem with your cannabis in Los

141
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,900
Angeles this is a completely different

142
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,060
approach than what they did in Denver at

143
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,159
the Denver International Airport they

144
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,709
set up what are called amnesty boxes

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,419
they're basically trash cans with a sign

146
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,489
on it there reminds you that it's

147
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,009
illegal to leave the state with your

148
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,110
cannabis they expect people with

149
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,879
leftover product to just drop their

150
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,680
cannabis in these little trash cans and

151
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,990
then you can travel safely with nothing

152
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,970
to worry about the last time anybody

153
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,728
spoke about these amnesty boxes

154
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,890
nobody has ever put anything in them

155
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,389
we've got a friend who travels through

156
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,550
the Denver International Airport on a

157
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,620
regular basis and she takes her medicine

158
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,689
with her and they've never given her any

159
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,579
trouble so it seems like as long as you

160
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:50,160
are not traveling with weapons or

161
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,050
explosives the TSA at the Denver

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,539
International Airport is not concerned

163
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,689
with cannabis possession however again

164
00:05:54,538 --> 00:06:00,839
keep in mind the legalities of cannabis

165
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,430
in your destination also I am NOT a

166
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,560
lawyer I don't claim to be one and I

167
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,240
don't play one on TV so never take legal

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,430
advice from a guy who calls himself

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,750
Rasta Jeff there are a couple of more

170
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,150
things to think about while I'm on the

171
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,189
subject I do not try to travel with your

172
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,779
torch they will take your torch from you

173
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,120
the torch is unacceptable to go on the

174
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,799
plane that can explode it can also be

175
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,399
used as a weapon they won't let you take

176
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,710
your torch

177
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,899
be very selective about your dabber if

178
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,399
you've got a happy daddy dabber happy

179
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,969
daddy makes the dabbers that look like

180
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,649
knives

181
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,090
that's a [ __ ] knife on the plane they

182
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:32,429
will not let you take that they will

183
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,288
confiscate that from you another thing

184
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,689
if you're gonna travel with medicine and

185
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:39,209
you were okay if you feel safe with your

186
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,740
medicine in your destination take it

187
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,870
in your carry-on you were much more

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,720
likely to get your medical marijuana

189
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,519
stolen from you by TSA if it is packed

190
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,319
in your suitcase and going under the

191
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,579
plane when they inspect that stuff

192
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,500
they'll steal it they're not looking at

193
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,180
you no one's looking at them there's no

194
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,978
eye contact they're just taking [ __ ] out

195
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,810
of a bag that's really easy for a person

196
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,209
to do without any sort of guilty

197
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,949
conscience or second thought so keep it

198
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,239
on you if that's an option have it in

199
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,250
your carry-on have it in your pocket

200
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,139
like I said if you're going through LAX

201
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,939
they don't care I'm not a lawyer

202
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,519
Denver doesn't seem to care that's kind

203
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,589
of a case-by-case basis if you do plan

204
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,228
to travel with product stay under the

205
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:18,388
limit in LAX its twenty-eight point five

206
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,310
grams which is more than an ounce we're

207
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,259
gonna talk about that just a second also

208
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,478
you get eight grams that's plenty of

209
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,430
cannabis to travel with then in Colorado

210
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,560
they haven't spoken about the rules if

211
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,840
you've got personal medicine they don't

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,550
seem to care so the first thing is stay

213
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,408
under your limit the second thing is

214
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,348
don't take a torch a torch is

215
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:38,668
intimidating that makes fire also when

216
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:40,649
you fly with that it goes up in the air

217
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:42,329
that could explode that's kind of

218
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,918
sketchy don't take a torch with you

219
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,359
that will cause you issues then the

220
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,310
other thing to think about is your

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,560
dabber is your dabber going to be

222
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,449
misconstrued as a weapon could it be

223
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,329
used as a weapon it doesn't have to look

224
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,250
like a weapon or maybe be intimidating

225
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:58,620
but could you use it as a weapon it can

226
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,478
be considered a weapon if you can use it

227
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,579
as one so think about that

228
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,978
when you're packing your data if you've

229
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,779
got a rig and a nail with you the TSA is

230
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:08,098
going to want to open up your case

231
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,750
they're gonna want to open up your

232
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:11,098
Pelican case and take the glass out

233
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,538
you're gonna want to make sure there's

234
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,389
nothing else in there they'll probably

235
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,339
run your case through the x-ray machine

236
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,098
or the scanning device of their choice

237
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,049
if you've got an expensive rig make them

238
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,478
aware of the value of that rig before

239
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,460
you open the case these are people you

240
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,750
can communicate with them talk to them

241
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,209
like an adult they're gonna say what's

242
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,949
in the case and you just say it's glass

243
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,019
would you like to see it it's functional

244
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,089
glass art would you like to see they're

245
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,208
gonna say yes say this is worth this

246
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,039
much money this is a $10,000 piece of

247
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,778
functional glass art before you touch

248
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,218
this I need you to know that but there's

249
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:46,169
nothing wrong with you inspecting my

250
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,640
case and they can look at it and if

251
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,169
you've got accessories in the case make

252
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,539
sure you make everything safe for them

253
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:53,069
so that's my simple advice for if you do

254
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:55,379
choose to travel with

255
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,990
rig don't take a torch don't take a

256
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,669
dangerous dabber and don't take too much

257
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,950
product other than that you should be

258
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:03,569
just fine based on your destination and

259
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,000
again I'm not a lawyer

260
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,610
don't take legal advice from a dude who

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,169
calls himself Rasta Geoff alright you

262
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,899
guys that is my report on the official

263
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:14,909
statement from LAX before we move on I

264
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,620
owe a few people some shoutouts I want

265
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,659
to give a huge shout out to Myles Porter

266
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,759

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,470
support you guys I truly appreciate it

271
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:34,769
now in the last segment I mentioned that

272
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,000
28.5 grams is more than one ounce it has

273
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,579
recently been brought to my attention

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that a lot of people are confused about

275
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,860
the actual weight of 1 ounce now let's

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
play a game I'm gonna ask you guys the

277
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,279
weight of 1 ounce and I want you to

278
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,470
answer out loud so if there are multiple

279
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,620
people in the room everybody can hear

280
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,870
your answer now here is my question how

281
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:00,389
many grams are in one ounce now

282
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,879
everybody that just said 28 grams you've

283
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:07,139
been ripping people off there are 28

284
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:10,470
point 3 4 9 5 grams in an ounce if you

285
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,210
round that up it is 28.3 5 grams for an

286
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,519
ounce now I know you're saying point

287
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,200
three five grams not a big deal well

288
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,449
let's do point three five grams on the

289
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,360
calculator we start off with one ounce

290
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,720
if we do let's start like this let's do

291
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:31,169
28 grams times for a quarter pound right

292
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,899
28 times 4 is 1/12 28.3 5 times 4 comes

293
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,519
out to a hundred and thirteen point four

294
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,639
now that's not that much of a difference

295
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,939
but in today's market every gram and

296
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,949
every dollar should count so start

297
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,940
thinking about that point three five

298
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:51,060
let's do it on a larger scale 0.35 times

299
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,920
16 ounces that's five point six grams

300
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,649
you're shorting a pound if you're

301
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,129
weighing 28 gram on tsa's your pound

302
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:01,110
will be 5.6 grams short and if we keep

303
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,600
going and keep compounding because in

304
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,090
today's market we buy way more than just

305
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,100
one pound we usually buy 5 or 10 pound

306
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,100
Lots at men

307
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,980
and in a 5-pound transaction if you were

308
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,330
weighing your ounces 228 grams you come

309
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,009
to 28 grams short over a five pound

310
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,050
transaction so that's a full ounce you

311
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,639
have no shortage your customer it

312
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,439
doesn't sound like a lot of product on

313
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,090
that large of a scale it doesn't sound

314
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,860
like a lot of money on that large of a

315
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,050
scale but when things are getting so

316
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,360
tight in this industry every gram and

317
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:35,179
every dollar should count for both the

318
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,129
buyer and the seller so let's get all in

319
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,199
the same page let's start functioning on

320
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,570
a twenty eight point three five gram

321
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,920
ounce so there is no argument and let's

322
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,200
do the math real quick here twenty eight

323
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,029
point three five times four you should

324
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,860
have a hundred and thirteen point four

325
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,350
grams and a quarter pound twenty-eight

326
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,539
point three five times eight a half a

327
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,879
pound two hundred and twenty six point

328
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:57,860
eight be friendly make it to 27 don't be

329
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,470
a dick twenty-eight point three five

330
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,659
times sixteen you were looking at four

331
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,910
hundred and fifty three point six if you

332
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:06,709
want to round that up that's 454 grams

333
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,719
in a pound if you want to be friendly

334
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,090
that's four hundred and fifty five grams

335
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,820
and a pound but like I said every gram

336
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,550
and every dollar should count in today's

337
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,550
market be a fair seller and people will

338
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:22,219
be happy buyers all right you guys that

339
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:24,169
is my two cents on one ounce I hope you

340
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,550
learned something from that you guys I

341
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,199
need to press pause I need to get a

342
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:29,419
drink I'll probably take a couple of

343
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,570
dabs and when we get back we're going to

344
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,889
read some emails from some listeners

345
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,850
take a dab with me boys and girls and

346
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,039
I'll be right back

347
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,170
all right podcast rolled I am back I am

348
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,870
heavily medicated and well hydrated

349
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:43,399
let's get right into these emails if

350
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,049
you'd like to send me an email the email

351
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,179
address is grow from your heart at

352
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:49,609
hotmail.com you know I'd like to hear

353
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:52,309
from you this first message goes like

354
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,139
this I've been enjoying you're learning

355
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,759
to grow series I've been growing for

356
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,159
many years now but while I was listening

357
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,519
I was reminded of my biggest mistake

358
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,429
during my first grow I had a male so I

359
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,500
cut it up and flushed it down the toilet

360
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,349
back then I didn't know plant material

361
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,360
will actually swell up when submerged in

362
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,850
water the plant got stuck in the

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,029
whole-house trap in my yard and then it

364
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,310
swelled up and plugged the pipe nothing

365
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,990
in the house would drain after freaking

366
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,869
out for a while I rented a

367
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,029
snake and spent the next eight hours

368
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,789
bringing up disgusting shitty bits of

369
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:31,370
weed plant back up my sewer pipe

370
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:33,049
everyone [ __ ] up now and then keep up

371
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,049
the good work

372
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,609
so this listener had a male plant and

373
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,829
they cut it down and cut it into pieces

374
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,629
and flushed it down the toilet which

375
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,240
ended up clogging up their whole

376
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:46,159
drainage system you guys nothing grow

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,379
related should go down the toilet not

378
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,350
plant material not waste water not

379
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,480
leftover nutrients not runoff water

380
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,950
definitely not pesticides all of that

381
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,899
stuff finds its way back to our

382
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,660
municipal water supply and gets fed back

383
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,340
to us so keep our water supply clean and

384
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,850
pay attention to what goes down the

385
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,920
toilet

386
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,570
also you may get yourself in trouble if

387
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,789
you cause a major clog and you can't

388
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,800
unclog it somebody has to come out maybe

389
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,779
the city maybe the city hires somebody

390
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,159
whoever comes they stick something down

391
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,019
in there they pull out half of a weed

392
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,879
plant they're gonna want to find out

393
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,740
where the rest of that weed plant is and

394
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,870
where it came from and find out if there

395
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,190
are more plants there so don't flush

396
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,870
your weed plants down the toilet you

397
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,390
guys that will not work that is not a

398
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,889
proper way of disposing of your plants I

399
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,019
want to give you a huge shout out to

400
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,819
this listener for a first acknowledging

401
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,889
that they made a huge mistake and then

402
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,750
second for having the heart to admit it

403
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,210
and share it with us so that we don't

404
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,120
make a similar mistake in our garden and

405
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,430
in our homes now my next message comes

406
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,159
from Dave in the UK and it goes like

407
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:49,549
this hey Rasta Jeff just a quick text

408
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,259
from the UK love the podcasts I've had

409
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,629
them on back to back for a couple of

410
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:55,519
weeks after discovering you great job

411
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,350
buddy hey Dave thanks for the great

412
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,960
compliments that's a great way to start

413
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,090
a message he goes on to say reminded me

414
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,210
of so many things I knew but forgot

415
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:07,940
thanks for that one thing I just

416
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,379
listened to episode 300 great [ __ ]

417
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,700
laughs by the way hey dude thanks for

418
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,439
laughing with us I'm glad you are

419
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,900
learning and laughing at the same time

420
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,030
that always makes it fun he says plus

421
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,949
and a couple other episodes you were

422
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,799
talking about popping or pinching the

423
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,570
stems I've not heard of this any chance

424
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,449
you could explain this technique and how

425
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:29,180
it's beneficial to your grow listening

426
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,820
has totally given me a kick up the arse

427
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,379
to get better and improve I ordered some

428
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,910
lemon Geoffrey as souvenirs

429
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,279
dude I would

430
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:40,159
to work for free just to come soak up

431
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,750
some of that knowledge man I appreciate

432
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,519
the offer to come work for free maybe

433
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,460
one of these days I will take you up on

434
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,740
that but let's get into the question

435
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,639
about pinching and twisting and popping

436
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,039
the stems on my plants I first learned

437
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,049
about twisting and popping the stems on

438
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,990
my cannabis plants from a grower and

439
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:02,449
breeder named soma when I learned about

440
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,789
it through soma he was calling it super

441
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,980
cropping I adapted the technique and

442
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,939
started doing it in my Gardens I got

443
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,800
pretty good at it

444
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,960
I started using it in commercial grows

445
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,599
one day I was introduced to another

446
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,480
grower who does a method of super

447
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,310
cropping but he goes way harder than I

448
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,500
had ever thought of going I would pop

449
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,599
the stems a couple of times throughout

450
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,190
the cycle and that would be it this guy

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,860
gets in there about every ten to

452
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,870
fourteen days and pops every inch of the

453
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,519
plant as soon as they're big enough to

454
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,950
take it as soon as they can tolerate it

455
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,199
in veg he starts cracking him and he

456
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,790
encourages cracking the stems all the

457
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,220
way through about the third week of

458
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,500
flower so we started implementing the

459
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,389
super cropping technique along with a

460
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,940
trellis and netting system and that

461
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,799
tremendously increased our yields and

462
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,210
productivity of the plants now let's

463
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,990
talk a little bit about what I'm doing

464
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,450
why I'm doing it and why it works one of

465
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,620
the challenges of dealing with

466
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,020
fast-growing cannabis plants in a

467
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,389
commercial environment is keeping them

468
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,789
from growing too tall too quickly we

469
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,889
want plants that produce very quickly we

470
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,569
want rapid growth but at the same time

471
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,730
we don't need those plants growing too

472
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,289
tall before they're finished in most

473
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,089
commercial environments we're limited by

474
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,649
ceiling height we can't have our plants

475
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,199
growing into the lights if you've got

476
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,240
DeVita's you want about three at least

477
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,430
two feet between your lights and your

478
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,289
plants maybe more depending on what

479
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,090
strain you're growing some plants don't

480
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:28,730
like to get too close to those kavita's

481
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,740
so we need to keep height in mind when

482
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,660
we're growing so how can I slow down

483
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,480
some of that vertical growth but still

484
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,130
keep strong robust plants I thought that

485
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,529
by cracking the stems in making the

486
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,510
branches and the stalks thicker the

487
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,849
plants would be thicker and wider and

488
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,670
they wouldn't have to grow as tall also

489
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:48,808
as I'm cracking them that slows them

490
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,519
down a little bit from getting taller

491
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:51,869
they're working more on repairing the

492
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,460
cracks that I just made

493
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,768
now I'm getting ahead of myself let me

494
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,710
talk more about the actual method of

495
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,690
popping the stems as soon as my plant is

496
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,579
transplanted into a three gallon pot

497
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,830
it's probably big enough to start

498
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,349
cracking I will grab the plant at the

499
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:08,970
base of the stalk right where it comes

500
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,528
out of the medium right where it comes

501
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,600
out of your soil your cocoa whatever

502
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:14,369
you're using I grab it you may need to

503
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,538
grab it like with your whole fist you

504
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:17,339
may need to be able to grab it with two

505
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:20,249
fingers it just depends on the size of

506
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:23,099
the stalk if it's the size of a pencil

507
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,600
or bigger this should work if you're

508
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,158
kind of clumsy maybe you want to work

509
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,408
with a plant that's got a thicker stock

510
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,869
maybe like a sharpie marker but this is

511
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,210
what I do I grab the stalk with one hand

512
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:36,028
maybe two fingers and my thumb then

513
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,129
right above that I grab it with my other

514
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:40,528
hand maybe two fingers maybe the whole

515
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:42,778
hand depends on how I can grab it then I

516
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:44,788
turn my hands opposite directions just

517
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:47,099
give it a little twist and you'll hear

518
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:48,569
just a little knuckle popping sound

519
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,490
you're basically gonna give it the start

520
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:53,069
of an Indian burn and what you want to

521
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,589
do is crack the cellulose walls you just

522
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:57,058
want to break the plant fiber you don't

523
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:58,740
want to bend it over you don't want to

524
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,960
topple it you just want to twist it

525
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,690
until you hear the plant fiber just snap

526
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,519
it'll make a real obvious cracking sound

527
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,230
it'll just be a little and you'll just

528
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,278
say oh that's exactly what I was looking

529
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,778
for you'll feel it

530
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:11,429
you'll hear it it's just like popping

531
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:14,368
your knuckle so give it a little twist

532
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,320
and then I leave my hand that was on top

533
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:18,240
right in place and I take the hand that

534
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,730
was on the bottom and just put it above

535
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,009
the hand that is now on the bottom and

536
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,798
then I repeat the process and I just

537
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:28,440
work my way up the stalk and I'll do a

538
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,089
crack every couple of inches crack put

539
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,369
my hand up top crack move the next hand

540
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:34,230
up crack move my hand up crack and just

541
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:36,148
keep going up the stock I'll do the main

542
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,220
stock all the way up until it gets real

543
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:39,628
skinny toward the top then I'll go to

544
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,429
the bottom branches and I'll start

545
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,928
cracking the bottom branches and work my

546
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,960
way all the way up to the top of each

547
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:48,570
plant we will spend an entire day in one

548
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,749
room poppin stems in a commercial grow

549
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:54,388
every stem gets a good twisting and

550
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:56,669
popping now we start this in veg and

551
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:58,648
when we started in veg it does slow the

552
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,190
plants down from growing to tall which

553
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:03,199
is good but it makes them get thicker

554
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,720
more robust stocks everywhere will be

555
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,369
broke the stock a little bit it creates

556
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,159
a little knuckle there on the plant and

557
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:13,249
I feel like those little knuckles create

558
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,249
stronger sturdier stocks and stronger

559
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:20,329
sturdier stocks can hold up stronger

560
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:22,608
thicker fatter buds also I feel like

561
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:25,189
those thicker fatter stocks can probably

562
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:28,220
provide more nutrient flow and more

563
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,950
water flow to the bigger thick fat buds

564
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,048
that we're trying to produce so I start

565
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,359
cracking in veg to start building a

566
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,918
strong robust structure I'm just working

567
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,388
them out I'm making a beefy I'm putting

568
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,549
some weight on them I'm basically

569
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:42,858
putting a collar with a tire on it

570
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:44,450
making my plants drag around that chain

571
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,489
and tire all day so they get thick and

572
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,528
beefy and then I keep doing that through

573
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:50,479
veg and then I continue to do that

574
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:52,608
through flour and at the start of flour

575
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:55,308
we clean up the bottoms of them and we

576
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:56,898
also defoliation so now the plants are

577
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:58,249
being cracked and they don't have all

578
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:00,079
the stuff on the bottom they don't have

579
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:01,669
as much leaf to work with they've got a

580
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,978
lot more structure and a lot more

581
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,629
sturdiness without all the excess weight

582
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,580
on them we've kind of taken that dog

583
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:09,528
chain and that tire off and now those

584
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:10,908
plants can run like an Olympic athlete

585
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:13,190
they're like we've been training and

586
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,200
we're ready to go we keep cracking them

587
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,090
for about three weeks into flour because

588
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,700
the plants stretch heavily when we put

589
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:21,470
them into flour that crack really slows

590
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,840
down that stretch they spend more time

591
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,058
repairing that crack than they do taking

592
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,189
off but they still transition very

593
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:30,798
smoothly into the flowering process and

594
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,720
then we quit cracking them as bud sets

595
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,700
so that way they can quit spending their

596
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,798
energy on repairing that cellulose

597
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,569
structure and they can start spending

598
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,509
all of their energy on producing

599
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:43,009
luscious buds after you get comfortable

600
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,079
with popping and twisting you'll learn

601
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,519
how to start bending the plants to where

602
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,138
you can point the branches where you

603
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,999
want them to get them out of the way of

604
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:51,498
each other or maybe fill in a little

605
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:53,179
space maybe you've got a little open

606
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,979
section over here and two branches are

607
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,869
crowded here you learn how to just grab

608
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:58,879
a branch and pop it and bend it to the

609
00:21:56,868 --> 00:22:00,228
direction you want you can kind of pop

610
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:02,118
it two or three times in different

611
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:03,950
places and totally change the direction

612
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:06,048
of a branch that'll start coming in

613
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,669
handy then you learn how to put up a

614
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:10,069
trellis net and then you'll start

615
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,049
popping the branches and twisting them

616
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:14,028
into the trellis net and that's when you

617
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:14,990
really start learning how to shape the

618
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,779
plant and shape

619
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,329
canapé start maximizing your square

620
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:22,609
footage for your canopy so that is the

621
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:24,799
main purpose of cracking and popping and

622
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:26,539
twisting the stems it does slow the

623
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,460
plants down and vertical growth in the

624
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,990
beginning but once they heal from it

625
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,929
they do take off and you have more

626
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,670
productive more robust plants and I

627
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,500
think popping and twisting your plants

628
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,570
is kind of a good training guide on

629
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,160
getting good at trellising your plants

630
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:42,019
it'll teach you how to work the branches

631
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,580
into the net a little better it'll make

632
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:45,410
you more comfortable and just grabbing a

633
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:47,599
branch and giving it a twist giving it a

634
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,850
bend you'll learn what the plants can

635
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,709
tolerate and what they won't take you'll

636
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,269
learn eventually that you can go way

637
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,400
lower if you're trying to bend this

638
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:57,139
branch into the trellis you may not want

639
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,269
to grab it six inches down and pop it

640
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,460
you may want to go 12 or 18 inches down

641
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:03,259
give it one good twist and a pop there

642
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,179
move up four or six inches give it

643
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:07,429
another pop there and use both of those

644
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,350
to lower pops to start changing the

645
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,090
direction of that branch so you have a

646
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:13,039
lot more space to work with and then

647
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,470
that branch is gonna grow up no matter

648
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,149
what so you can kind of pop it down low

649
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,740
bend it the way you need it get it into

650
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,259
the net and then it's gonna grow back up

651
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,670
so popping and twisting is kind of the

652
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,259
starter to that that's where you learn

653
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,910
how to do it then you'll throw up a

654
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:27,470
trellis then you'll really get good at

655
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,300
popping and twisting and working into

656
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,009
that net system so that's why it's

657
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,079
beneficial that's where it comes in

658
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,420
super handy and a commercial grow system

659
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,699
and I feel like it really makes the

660
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,380
plants more productive once they recover

661
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,630
from all the popping and twisting that

662
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,120
we do to them so that is why I do

663
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,340
popping and twisting and super cropping

664
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,229
in a commercial grow I hope that gives

665
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:50,269
you another kick in the arse to do a

666
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,190
little more work in the garden I hope

667
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:54,349
you enjoy collecting the lemon jeffrey
