00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,058
welcome to the podcast everybody I'm

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,280
your host Rasta Jeff this is episode 810

8
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,899
of the girl from your heart podcast once

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
again I've got a great show lined up for

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,340
us in this episode I'm going to give

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,079
away free irie genetics premium seeds

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,300
hang out we'll talk more about the free

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,280
seeds later in this episode I don't want

14
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,619
to waste too much time let's jump right

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,260
into the question and answer portion of

16
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,000
this podcast this question came from my

17
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,000
friend Anthony it did come from the grow

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,820
help tab on the ire genetics website go

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
to the ire genetics website at

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,939
iregenetics.com there's a tab on the top

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,859
that says grow help or grow questions

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,560
click on there send me your questions

23
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:11,159
this one came from Anthony and it goes

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,219
just like this it says hey Ross to Jeff

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,540
in Fino hunting is it best to naturally

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,060
see how the plants develop

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,580
simultaneously organically mixed out

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,140
with other stresses or is it best to

29
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,900
push them to their fullest potential

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,560
with salt and stress and maximize their

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,240
capabilities or both and or why that is

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,340
a lot of question in there there's a lot

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,959
to think about in that question this is

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,159
a lot of fun so let me break this down

35
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,039
we're going to start from the beginning

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,900
and answer this step by step and talk a

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,360
lot about this question this one's very

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,159
fun for me uh in Fino hunting what's a

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,859
final hunt that is when we get an amount

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,600
of seeds a population it could be five

41
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,459
it could be ten it could be a hundred it

42
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,319
could be a hundred thousand anywhere in

43
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,719
between there that is when we are

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,239
running a population of seeds and

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,000
looking for the phenotype which is most

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,379
desirable for our situation if you've

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,118
got a commercial growth you've got a

48
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,640
home growth you've got a big space a

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,438
small space indoors Outdoors your

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,939
phenotype selection may be a little bit

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,739
different maybe you want the one that

52
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,759
tastes a lot like strawberry maybe you

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,439
want the one that tastes a lot like

54
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,299
mango maybe you want the one that grows

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,919
taller maybe you want the one that grew

56
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,780
real wide and short that's your

57
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,280
phenotypical selection that you're

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,039
looking for the variation that you will

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,900
see amongst the pack will vary uh based

60
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,818
on the uh the plants that you're growing

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,560
if you're growing something like an F1

62
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,839
you may see a lot of variation if you're

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,759
going in F2 you'll see a lot more within

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,259
the F3 it may start tapering off it

65
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,359
maybe even more wild depending on what

66
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,098
the breeder did but that is going to be

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
a final hunt when you're running a pack

68
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,119
of seeds and looking for the specific

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,219
plant within that package within that

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,620
population to meet your needs a Fino

71
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,500
hunt let's find the phenotype for my

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,019
garden for my specific needs so that's a

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,039
pheno hunt when Fino hunting is it best

74
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,719
to naturally see how the plants develop

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,239
simultaneously organically maxed out

76
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,459
with other stresses or best to push them

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,959
to their fullest potential okay so if

78
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,539
I'm running a final hunt if I'm looking

79
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,280
for a specific phenotype first of all

80
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,378
I'll probably run all of these seeds

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,840
exactly the same on their first run I've

82
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:15,179
got just like a basic nutrient mix a

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,120
small little tester grow area I would

84
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,739
put all of the seedlings in that run in

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,019
that first little room kind of like the

86
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,759
casting couch the auditioning process

87
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,039
before I put them into a great big room

88
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,620
and see what they do I do a small Fino

89
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,439
hunt in a small room so I would run

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,420
everybody in the same conditions that

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,000
way I can see what they do under just

92
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,339
normal conditions if you normally grow

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Organics grow them organically if you

94
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,759
normally grow with bottled nutrients

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,799
grow them with bottled nutrients if you

96
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,719
normally do it hydroponically do it

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,420
hydroponically if your regular routine

98
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,299
is to do it in Cocoa with perlite and

99
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,699
New Millennium nutrients and a gravity

100
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,260
fed drip system do that because that's

101
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,839
what we need to find the plant that

102
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,818
works the best in the system which we

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,319
are working with you've got to find the

104
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,899
plant that's going to perform in your

105
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,000
system so why not run it run it in the

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,980
system so that's the way I do it I run

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,560
them all the same in a very basic system

108
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,539
then I will make my phenotype selection

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
then once I've made that selection I

110
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,560
will grow it a couple of times in very

111
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,599
similar conditions and take a lot of

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,699
notes and then I will start adjusting it

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,979
based on what I see could be possible

114
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,960
does it need more does it need less of

115
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,339
something of anything can I push

116
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,019
something a little bit harder would

117
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,299
something make it a little bit happier

118
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,159
do I start noticing that right at week

119
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,840
six it really starts to beef up so maybe

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,460
at week five I could start feeding it a

121
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,079
little bit more that way I could beef it

122
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,418
up a little bit heavier maybe I noticed

123
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,859
that if I over feed it a week seven it

124
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:42,719
starts to turn yellow and stops eating

125
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,240
maybe I'll stop over feeding it so much

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,220
learn that plant and then adjust to that

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,439
after you found your phenotype so you're

128
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,699
saying in Fino hunting is it best to

129
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,500
naturally see how they develop

130
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,560
simultaneously yes I do the same thing

131
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,959
to all of them then you say organically

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,540
maxed out with other stresses or best to

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,399
push them no I don't push them uh very

134
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,560
super hard until I actually have made a

135
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,359
phenotypical selection I kind of run

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,280
just a basic mix I've got a real good

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,620
New Millennium balanced mix that I know

138
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,359
works for just about every plant I will

139
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,399
run all the plants in that under the

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,900
basic lighting system that I've got and

141
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,399
sometimes my basic lighting system

142
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,978
changes sometimes I've got different

143
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,198
ideas sometimes it changes uh seasonally

144
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:23,579
in the winter of course I hang up an HPS

145
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,800
light I don't want to put a heater in

146
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,418
the room I just put up an HBS and add a

147
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,160
few more plants under that in the summer

148
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,719
it's way too hot I couldn't run that

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,699
thing right now it roast the entire room

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,620
so the HBS just comes down in the

151
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,478
summertime I make a few adjustments like

152
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,340
that but I really don't change a lot but

153
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,199
also I do what I'm going to do to them

154
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,418
in the future if I plan on topping them

155
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,038
if I plan on lollipopping them if I'm

156
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:45,719
going to spread them out if I'm going to

157
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,819
scrog them if I'm going to just see if

158
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,560
green them is little tiny plants I do

159
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,120
that to the whole run and if that's

160
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
going to be my plan for the future for

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,019
these plants then that's what I'm going

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,399
to do in the starter run because I want

163
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,198
to know what I'm going to get when I put

164
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,638
this plant in the big room so I want to

165
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,919
know what to expect it's got to be able

166
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,300
to handle my basic nutrient feed then I

167
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,579
can work from there if it can take my

168
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,680
basic just my basic feed my basic

169
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,478
nutrition I know how to boost it from

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
there and make it even better if it can

171
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:12,839
handle my pesticide regimen if it can

172
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,538
handle my lighting schedule if it can

173
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,918
handle uh being lollipopped way far up

174
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:18,478
the way that I like to do it and then

175
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,978
have a lot of the little sucker branches

176
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,019
taken off and a lot of popping and

177
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,060
twisting and bending it over and putting

178
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,099
it into a scrog can it handle that sort

179
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,019
of stuff that's the phenotype the Fino

180
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,879
hunt that I'm going to give it so if it

181
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,439
can handle all of that stuff I need to

182
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,600
find that out in the first run before I

183
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,038
go put it into a bigger room so I think

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,139
what I'm trying to say is run the final

185
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,818
hunt just like you're going to run your

186
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,978
main run if you're going to top it top

187
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,539
it if you're gonna scrog it out scrog it

188
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,240
out that way we can find the plant that

189
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,860
works the best in that situation of

190
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,800
course that is if you've got time space

191
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,840
room all of the Necessities to run a big

192
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,079
final hunt and do all of those things to

193
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,478
those plants oftentimes we may get the

194
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,859
phrase Fino hunt and testers mixed up

195
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:00,839
because I do them differently but

196
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,939
sometimes it happens very similarly

197
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,739
sometimes I'll be doing a test run and

198
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,839
find a phenotype that is [ __ ] magical

199
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,939
in there so sometimes they look similar

200
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,679
but they are actually different uh

201
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,439
projects with different goals a test

202
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,019
batch I'm just seeing what we have did I

203
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,459
hit my goal do we have any problems uh

204
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,500
what do they look like what did we

205
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,818
create with a final hunt those have been

206
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,959
tested we know that those have been

207
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,360
narrowed down to where they're going to

208
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,339
be acceptable quality seeds uh then we

209
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,919
just have to find the works find the one

210
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,359
that works the best for for our needs a

211
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,098
lot of times I can't do that by running

212
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,840
a small plant finding something that I

213
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,120
like but it is much better and I do

214
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,978
recommend to manipulate it however

215
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,019
you're going to manipulate that plant in

216
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,060
your big room I guess I would say train

217
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,439
how you're going to go to battle or

218
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,839
practice with the drumsticks you're

219
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,519
going to play with at the gig is what I

220
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,019
think I'm trying to say all right my

221
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,000
buddy Anthony he does wrap it up with a

222
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,198
couple of other things here uh sort of

223
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,240
some private stuff to me and then he

224
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,919
says thank you for keeping me safe wraps

guys it goes on though it says roster

280
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,278
Jeff I am currently running Sun kiss for

281
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,980
the first time that is a great plant you

282
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,958
will enjoy it it says I am late in veg

283
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,180
and I will be flipping them here shortly

284
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,458
all right that sounds like fun my

285
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,620
question is when would the best time be

286
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,259
to start implementing the flour

287
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,419
nutrients I know I shouldn't start them

288
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,759
until they have been flipped but about

289
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,259
how many weeks after the flip I've read

290
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,059
so many different answers on the

291
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,740
internet yes the internet is wild that's

292
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,319
what part of what inspired this podcast

293
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,240
is I would read all of the crazy answers

294
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,339
that people gave you for this simple

295
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,959
question and my head would explode and I

296
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,000
would like to uh bash my head against

297
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,500
the wall and drive my car to each one of

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,778
these people's houses and ask them why

299
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,639
they wrote what they wrote and I it just

300
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,200
drove me crazy so yeah I tried to filter

301
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,120
out all the [ __ ] for you and give

302
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,940

00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,000
here while you're subscribing go see

328
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,278
some of the older stuff that we put out

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,139
a long time ago we've been doing this

330
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,399
for 800 episodes quite a few years go

331
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,860
check out that but there's an old

332
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,778
episode now the question when would you

333
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,000
start implementing flowering nutrients

334
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,860
that's a very good question there are a

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,379
couple of options for this you can start

336
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,759
uh day one the day that you flip that

337
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,379
plant into flower you could just set

338
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,600
that veg bottle right over there and

339
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,519
bring that flowering bottle over start

340
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
using that you are now officially in

341
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,320
flower you were using your flowering

342
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,019
nutrients or you could gradually taper

343
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
it off you could phase out that uh

344
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,899
whatever so if you're feeding I don't

345
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,159
know how much I don't know the amounts

346
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,139
but I'll say a hundred because it's

347
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,000
easier to keep track if you're feeding a

348
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,179
hundred mils while you're in veg maybe

349
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,940
drop it to 50 mils 50 milliliters of

350
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,859
your veg and 50 milliliters of Bloom for

351
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,899
a week and then cut out that veg and go

352
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,180
a hundred percent all the way onto the

353
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,980
bloom nutrients or you could phase it

354
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,719
out as long or slowly as you would like

355
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,519
I would recommend over the first two

356
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,660
weeks I wouldn't go longer than two

357
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,720
weeks that's as long as you need to

358
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:21,120
taper that process off some strains some

359
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
cultivars do need a little bit more

360
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,899
nitrogen to get them all the way through

361
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,360
the flowering process so it's not a bad

362
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,860
idea to keep that vegetative nutrient

363
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,259
going get a little bit more nitrogen

364
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,800
into there some plants however some OG

365
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,078
cush type cultivars dog walker uh

366
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,479
specifically does not like too much

367
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,919
nitrogen a little bit early into the

368
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,659
flowering phase you got to cut that one

369
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,059
out a little bit earlier but that's just

370
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:47,639
some strains dog walkers some of the

371
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,439
cushier type stuff it just won't let it

372
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,299
stack up properly sometimes it does what

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,760
I call the stairway or the spiral

374
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,439
staircase your buds should stack and

375
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,120
then stack and then just stack up but

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,339
sometimes it'll make Just a Little Rock

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,539
nugget and then right around the pole of

378
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,800
the stem it'll make a little another one

379
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:03,719
and then right around the pole make

380
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,699
another one It'll like Spiral up the

381
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,800
stick up the stock of the plant instead

382
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,320
of making a big bud like it should that

383
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,659
could be from over feeding nitrogen uh

384
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
too much into the flowering phase but if

385
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,958
you Fade Out phase out that nitrogen

386
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,000
within the first two weeks you will be

387
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,399
just fine so if you're growing something

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320
from my lineup a go to go cross and a

389
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,419
rise cross maybe even the Afterglow

390
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
crosses I would recommend possibly

391
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,019
keeping some of that nitrogen in there

392
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,338
at least the first week of the flowering

393
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,799
phase while you're feeding because the

394
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,019
plants I make are super hungry they are

395
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,240
hyper vigorous they do eat a lot and

396
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,919
they do go nine to ten maybe even a

397
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,019
little bit longer than 10 weeks in some

398
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,699
cases so those plants may need that

399
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,399
nitrogen your plant is going to eat most

400
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,079
of the nitrogen early on in the

401
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,940
flowering phase and it's going to store

402
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,859
it up in the vegetative phase so you

403
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,720
need to get that in there early once it

404
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,639
starts fading once the nitrogen is too

405
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,139
low it's hard to catch up we're calling

406
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,120
it chasing is what we call it when you

407
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,339
can't get enough nitrogen in there let

408
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,440
me take a look at my notes see what else

409
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,060
we could tell you I would you can either

410
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,459
just cut it off right at day one when

411
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,319
you flip the light to 1212 that is day

412
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,239
one a flower and you can also flip to

413
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,100
your flowering nutrients or you can take

414
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,519
up to two weeks and slowly gradually

415
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,200
replace them as you feel necessary so

416
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,700
this is going to be plant specific you

417
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,860
do have the option to either just cut it

418
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,540
off at day one or like I keep saying you

419
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,579
can taper it off over a week or a two

420
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,719
week process if you do the taper off

421
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:26,699
just make sure that you're doing like

422
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,800
whatever percentage of one and the

423
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,620
percentage of the other bottle and work

424
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,899
from 100 this way to 100 this way use

425
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,519
the sliding scale do the math as long as

426
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,899
it takes as much percentage as it does

427
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,959
take you maybe just go in quarters

428
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,958
replace it go like 25 flowering nudes 50

429
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,759
75 then 100 flowering nudes over the

430
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,379
course of a week or two that'll get you

431
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,539
there beautifully all right I think I've

432
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,220
rambled on enough about this one my

433
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,838
friend New York green since I read your

434
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,000
question here on the podcast cast that

435
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,279
does mean that you win a free pack of

436

send me your address so I can send you a

438
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,739
free pack of seeds when you do send me

439
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,299
that shipping address please include a

440

real name that I can put on the box or

441
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,838
at least a a legit looking name I can

442
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,159
put on the box I don't want to put New

443
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,019
York green on there no offense that's

444
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,519
just what I'm using for now if anybody

445
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,320
else out there wins free seeds from me

446
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,940
please do put a real name in the email

447
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,639
so that I can send you your seeds and

448
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,980
not have to send it to weed smoker 5000

449
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,240
and Ganja Farmer 420 just makes me

450
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,920
uncomfortable when I go to the post

451
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,259
office and the lady scans the box and

452
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,419
looks at it and goes Ganja Farmer 420

453
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,778
huh that sets it down and scans the next

454
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,458
box Stoner Dave 5000 huh sets it down

455
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,139
and like she sees a theme and I don't

456
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,239
want them to get any ideas you know what

457
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,919
I'm saying so let's just send a real

458
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,778
name now there's no need to kill the

459
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,399
momentum let's keep the party moving I

460
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:44,278
do have another great message here in

461
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,440
front of me this one also came from the

462
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,120
grow help tab on the ire genetics

463
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,579
website this one came from a person

464
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,259
called pineapple long tooth big shout

465
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,939
out to pineapple a long tooth for the

466
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,919
great question we've got a breeding

467
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,320
question this time and it goes a little

468
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,719
bit like this it says hey Ross to Jeff

469
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm a long time listener and I owe parts

470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,220
of my growing success to you you don't

471
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,078
owe me anything bro this was enough we

472
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,060
are even now thank you for the love

473
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,819
thank you for the question now all you

474
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,799
got to do is grow the best you can make

475
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,500
me proud all right it goes on it says

476
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,120
I'm now looking to do some breeding yes

477
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,399
I'm glad I've inspired you to do some

478
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,698
breeding it says I have identified which

479
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,620
male I want to use I'm now curious on

480
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,479
when to pollinate that is a very good

481
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,039
question uh the next part of the

482
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,079
question is would you suggest flipping

483
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,379
the male and the females at the same

484
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,000
time or would you stagger the flowering

485
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,620
that is a very good question I've got a

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
very long drawn out answer we'll get to

487
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,879
that don't worry it says I would like to

488
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,740
chop the mail down after he drops pollen

489
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,360
and I have collected some as well is

490
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,240
there another time I should pollinate

491
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,459
the females again thank you for all your

492
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,620
help and work with the podcast your

493
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,919
information is help so many and I

494
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,440
consistently re-listen to shows for the

495
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,419
information thanks again your pal

496
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,800
pineapple long tooth pineapple that is a

497
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,059
great message my dude thank you I

498
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,139
appreciate it

499
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,759
um I'm glad you're listening to the

500
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,280
podcast multiple times I'm glad you're

501
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,740
learning I'm glad you are breeding now

502
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,980
let's answer some of these breeding

503
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,199
specific questions the first part of the

504
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,660
question is would I stagger the

505
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,000
flowering of the male and female plant

506
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,558
for a breeding project in an Ideal World

507
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,818
if you're trying to make a lot of [ __ ]

508
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,279
ton of seeds if you're trying to sell

509
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,798
them yes you would want to learn the

510
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,139
Staggering time of these plants it would

511
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,440
be better you just make more seeds to be

512
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,840
honest with you but but if you can't do

513
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,700
that they will work perfectly fine if

514
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,379
you put the male and females in the room

515
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,538
all at the same time guess what will

516
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,039
happen you will make a bunch of seeds

517
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,319
the only difference will be you could

518
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,298
make a lot more seed if you time it

519
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,859
better the only reason I stress on

520
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,019
timing it differently is because I make

521
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,519
seeds for commercial production in I

522
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,900
want to make as many as I can because of

523
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,940
course I want to get them out there I

524
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,919
want to sell them that is my product if

525
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,960
you're making seeds for yourself you

526
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,759
will make plenty of seeds if you just

527
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,740
throw them all in there at the same time

528
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,019
now let's talk about your options here

529
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,819
if you do want to stagger them I would

530
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,579
get the male pollinating you want him

531
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:14,399
making a big fat cloud of pollen when

532
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,619
your female plants have big fat ripe

533
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,538
pistols those dandelion looking flowery

534
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,579
things popping up on your plants those

535
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,859
are what's going to get pollinated you

536
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,298
want as much of that as possible on that

537
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,699
plant you want them as healthy as

538
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,058
possible on that plant this could happen

539
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,460
anywhere between somewhere around

540
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:33,899
approximately day 23 to day 32 it could

541
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,200
be a little earlier it could be a little

542
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,600
later I want to say day 23 to day 32

543
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,700
this just depends on the female plant

544
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,798
I've got two plants that I like to use

545
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,960
as examples in this occurrence quite

546
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,240
often I have got a strawberry fields

547
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,519
plant which makes strawberry Starburst

548
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,200
that also makes the red pill it also

549
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,480
made Raphael well it makes a few other

550
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,980
things coming up there's Jack the Ripper

551
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,380
across to the Strawberry Fields we'll

552
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,720
talk more about that in the future then

553
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,640
also I've got the Platinum Tangy that's

554
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,200
what makes the orange gasm that's what

555
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,820
makes the sun kiss there's a lot of

556
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,400
stuff that came from the Platinum Tangy

557
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,558
uh the Michelangelo came from that one

558
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,480
they're awesome amazing plants they both

559
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,298
make a lot of great seeds they both big

560
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,160
both make a lot of great crosses but I

561
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:18,779
have to time them completely differently

562
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,480
in the breeding room if I want to

563
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,819
maximize their seed potential the

564
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,279
Platinum Tangy plant will accept pollen

565
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:28,200
much earlier when I put the Platinum

566
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,058
Tangy plant into flower I only have to

567
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,279
wait three maybe three and a half weeks

568
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,558
before I pollinate that plant the

569
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,599
Strawberry Fields plant that plant needs

570
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,819
at least four maybe five weeks before

571
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,759
it's fully ready for pollen and then

572
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,839
they create the same amount of seeds so

573
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,400
now I have learned to put that

574
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,859
Strawberry Fields plant into the

575
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,140
flowering room a week 10 days maybe two

576
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,839
weeks ahead of the Platinum Tangy plant

577
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,000
if I want them both to receive pollen at

578
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,678
the ideal time also I would start

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,298
flowering the male plant just a little

580
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,240
bit early maybe a week or 10 days

581
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:02,279
earlier than everybody else if you can

582
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,960
keep him away from everybody if you can

583
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,000
keep him from pollinating everybody else

584
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,860
get that pollen going in there so he's

585
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,319
building up a big load of pollen then

586
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,939
when all the females are ready take uh I

587
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,918
would take him in there if you can take

588
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,019
the top in there it just depends on what

589
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,640
your situation is get the top off that

590
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,099
plant get that plant get it in there and

591
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,419
pollinate maybe take off the top leave

592
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,918
the rest of the plant let it build up

593
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,020
more pollen chop down the rest of the

594
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,020
plant you asked another part should I

595
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,700
pollinate a second time yes five to ten

596
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,440
days later pollinate again don't wait

597
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,660
too long maybe five to seven days later

598
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,519
pollinate again about a week I generally

599
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,019
do it a week apart that way the plant

600
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,879
can build up more pollen a few more

601
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,500
pistols or what didn't get pollinated

602
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,059
will receive some more pollen go in

603
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,919
there and smack it around so wait until

604
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:45,839
your female plants are all ready for the

605
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,460
pollen get your mail plan in there give

606
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,779
them a good Shake get that pollen in

607
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,700
there cut them if you need to get parts

608
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,619
of the pollen moving around do whatever

609
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,360
you need to do to fully pollinate that

610
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,579
room get all of the females get every

611
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,798
pistol let that male plant build up

612
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,240
another load for about seven days then

613
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,798
at this point you can cut them down and

614
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,019
carry them and touch each plant with him

615
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,000
and get that pollen everywhere you're

616
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,980
going to make a mess now clean up the

617
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,200
room that is the worst part of pollen is

618
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,640
that it's [ __ ] everywhere and it

619
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,919
tastes like [ __ ] and it sucks to clean

620
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,780
up but that is breeder life so do that

621
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,460
then once you've got everything cleaned

622
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,839
up you've done your second pollination

623
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,519
that's when you can decide if you want

624
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,918
to run those lights on your regular 12

625
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,859
12 or if you want to do research and

626
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,360
watch my 18-6 after pollination video

627
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:29,279
where I talk about changing the light

628
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,719
cycle all right let me check in on this

629
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,119
see if I've covered all of your

630
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,279
questions when to pollinate

631
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,259
um I would pollinate when the pistols

632
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,359
are the ripest that's going to depend on

633
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,400
a lot of different things the cultivar

634
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,379
the room the environment the feed the

635
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,880
lights the VPD will make a big

636
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,440
difference on that what you've sprayed

637
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
them try not to spray anything if you

638
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,679
can that's going to make it a big

639
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,599
difference

640
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,759
um would you suggest flipping them male

641
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,678
and females at the same time if you've

642
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,419
got a perfect world I would flip the

643
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,460
male seven to ten days ahead maybe two

644
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,380
weeks ahead of everybody then start

645
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,579
flipping the females as you know that

646
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,799
they go into the room with their

647
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,240
flowering routine then I would Paul

648
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,038
there's more let me stay on track would

649
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,798
you stagger the flowering yes if you can

650
