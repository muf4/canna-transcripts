need all right guys I want to give a

52
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,259
huge shout out to my friend Fred Garvin

53
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,118
I'm gonna turn this music down just a

54
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,519
little more I want to give a huge shout

55
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,009
out to Fred Garvin I posted something to

56
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,179
Facebook and Fred politely commented

57
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,709
saying hey Jeff you've been doing a

58
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,300
great job but you've kind of strayed

59
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,889
away from the grow less

60
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,230
uh and he asked for more girl lessons

61
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,609
Fred I can't agree with you more I have

62
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,989
strayed away from the girl lessons that

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,060
I've tried to provide you there's been

64
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,500
so much great news I don't know that all

65
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,479
the news has been great but there's been

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,610
so much important news that I felt like

67
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,469
it's been my job to bring that news to

68
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,030
the cannabis world so you're right I

69
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:28,710
have gotten a little bit away from the

70
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,360
grow lessons and I got a lot into the

71
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,270
news but you know what we're gonna get

72
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,560
back in the grow lessons I've got part

73
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,180
of this will be a little bit about grow

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,310
lessons and then the next episode is

75
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,319
going to be about pH which is all about

76
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,849
growing so Fred you're totally correct

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,789
and I will fix that we'll get back to

78
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,900
the grow lessons my friend but before we

79
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,159
get that far I know I just said we're

80
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,080
gonna get back in a girl lessons and get

81
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,609
away from the news but I've already had

82
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,500
this episode plan so you're gonna have

83
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,660
to bear with me you guys there's a very

84
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,530
important news article that I want to

85
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,879
read to you I'm thumbing through my

86
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,560
computer trying to find it now to tell

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,909
you the truth there we go all right

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
we're gonna get right to it this news

89
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,930
article comes from the cannabis I found

90
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,759
this very important since I have

91
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,379
recently taken over as the lead grower

92
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,959
at the spot dispensary in Pueblo West

93
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,490
Colorado now that I am running a large

94
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,599
facility things like this really stand

95
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,010
out to me so let's get right to the

96
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,599
article you guys this is from the

97
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,120
cannabis and it was written by Kristen

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,370
Wyatt of The Associated Press the

99
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,439
headline is unknowns abound in pesticide

100
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,420
use for growing pot then the sub

101
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,159
headline says there is no federal agency

102
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,988
that will recognize this as a legitimate

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,900
crop pest management information

104
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,150
regarding this crop devolves to internet

105
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,789
chats and hearsay says Whitney Crenshaw

106
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,400
a Colorado State University entomologist

107
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,349
and pesticide expert so obviously this

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,379
is going to be about pesticides and bugs

109
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,780
and cannabis plants so the article goes

110
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,030
like this microscopic bugs and mildew

111
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,949
can destroy a marijuana operation faster

112
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,599
than any police raid and because the

113
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,519
crop has been illegal for so long

114
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,379
either growers nor scientists have any

115
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,140
reliable research to help fight the

116
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,629
infections if you guys have ever grown

117
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,909
any cannabis you'll know that the number

118
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,489
one obstacle can be bugs for you once

119
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,139
bugs show up it is hard as hell to get

120
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,489
rid of bugs in a grow room if you're not

121
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,349
experienced and if you don't know what

122
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,569
you're doing we'll keep filling it says

123
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,009
as legal marijuana moves from basements

124
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,989
and backwoods to warehouses and

125
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,789
commercial fields the mold and spider

126
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,439
mites that once ruined only a few plants

127
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,689
at a time can now quickly create a

128
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,519
multi-million dollar crisis

129
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:26,030
some returning to industrial-strength

130
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,889
chemicals raising concerns about safety

131
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:30,769
they say multi-million dollar crisis for

132
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,598
growers they are not kidding you guys um

133
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:35,278
the facility that we are that I am

134
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:38,998
working in that I am helping them finish

135
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:41,999
build we have for flowering rooms and

136
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:45,330
one of those rooms has 26

137
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:48,330
kavita lights hanging in there our

138
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:49,709
projections are almost anybody's goal if

139
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,438
you're growing with a Kavita your goal

140
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,418
is 2 pounds per light so that's 52

141
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,639
projected pounds of cannabis coming out

142
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,109
of that room I can't really tell you

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,848
what the going rate is for a pound of

144
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,669
cannabis in Colorado right now at a

145
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:05,399
retail center or being sold from retail

146
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:07,258
to retail Center but that is quite an

147
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,870
investment if I were to [ __ ] up 52

148
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,550
pounds of weed that would really cost us

149
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,158
quite a bit of money we would not make

150
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,050
the money we planned on making I would

151
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:17,728
that's that's a bummer in the first

152
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,288
place then you can't pay the bills then

153
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:21,628
your short money then you don't have

154
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:23,068
product on the shelf it would cause a

155
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,949
lot of problems obviously you can see

156
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,960
how 152 pounds artist it really caused a

157
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,759
lot of problems and then you forgot all

158
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,068
the wasted time and the wasted plants

159
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,169
because the plants cost money all the

160
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,419
wasted nutrients all the wasted

161
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:39,508
electricity it could really add up

162
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,338
quickly so I'm going to continue the

163
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,110
article here where was I it says

164
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:44,459
herbicides and insecticides are

165
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,319
regulated by the federal government

166
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,899
which still regards almost all marijuana

167
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,080
as an illicit crop so there's no roadmap

168
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,800
to help pot farmers chemists and

169
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,478
horticulturalists can't offer much

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,278
assistance either they sometimes

171
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,199
disagree about how to combat the problem

172
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,310
largely because the plant is used in

173
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,740
many different ways

174
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,500
smoked eaten and sometimes rubbed into

175
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,389
the skin we have an industry that's been

176
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,310
illegal for so many years that there's

177
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,050
no research there's no guidelines

178
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,478
there's nothing said Frank Conrad lab

179
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,639
director of Colorado green lab a pot

180
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,620
testing lab in Denver in states that

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,389
regulate marijuana officials are just

182
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,639
starting to draft rules governing safe

183
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,620
levels of chemicals so far there have

184
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,259
been no reports on any human illness

185
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,778
trace to chemicals used on marijuana but

186
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,088
worries do persist the city of Denver

187
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:31,829
the spring quarantine tens of thousands

188
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:33,750
of marijuana plants at 11 growing

189
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,128
facilities after health inspectors

190
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,379
suspected use of

191
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,119
authorized pesticides some of the plants

192
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,039
were later released after tests revealed

193
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:43,559
the pot was safe but two producers

194
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,038
voluntarily destroyed their plants

195
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:50,309
actually there was about 600 pounds of

196
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,488
cannabis voluntarily destroyed because

197
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,929
of illegal pesticides the article says

198
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:57,899
eight businesses still have at least

199
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:59,728
some plants in quarantine the article

200
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,199
goes on to say in Oregon a June

201
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:03,568
investigation by The Oregonian newspaper

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,119
found pesticides in excess of legal

203
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,649
limits on produce on products ranging

204
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,589
from marijuana buds too concentrated

205
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,209
marijuana oils other pesticides detected

206
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:14,399
on the marijuana are not regulated by

207
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,079
Oregon's marijuana rules meaning that

208
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,538
products containing those chemicals

209
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,338
still can be sold there the US

210
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,408
Environmental Protection Agency which

211
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:24,718
decides which pesticides can be used on

212
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,819
which crops just said last month that

213
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:28,740
Colorado and Washington authorities that

214
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,269
they could apply to have some cannabis

215
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,490
related chemicals approved through

216
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:34,709
what's called a special local need

217
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,559
registration but that process could take

218
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:40,139
years so it looks like we're on our way

219
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:41,879
but it could take years it says here it

220
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,860
goes on to say Colorado and Oregon

221
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,360
require retail marijuana to undergo

222
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,278
testing for pesticides and other

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,559
contaminants but as the Oregon an

224
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:51,899
investigation showed the testing regimes

225
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:53,789
are imperfect and Colorado hasn't yet

226
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,009
implemented requirements for retail pot

227
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:58,168
to undergo pesticide testing because of

228
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,490
regulatory delays there aren't any labs

229
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:01,948
here that'll test for here you guys

230
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,598
that's part of the problem a Washington

231
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,519
state is still working on its pesticide

232
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,188
rules the nation's largest marijuana

233
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,468
producer California has no regulations

234
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,740
at all for growing commercial pot and

235
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:16,649
you know up until this industry got

236
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,579
hugely popular on a recreational and

237
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:24,269
legal level the guidelines and the

238
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:26,490
people who were responsible for quality

239
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:29,098
control were the growers we were the

240
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,809
ones responsible for that it was a craft

241
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:32,848
it was an art it was something that we

242
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:34,918
were proud of we would not let out a

243
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,870
product that had been sprayed with some

244
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,240
[ __ ] or a product that had powdery

245
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,899
mildew on it we were the ones who were

246
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,389
responsible for that

247
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,549
took that that responsibility and now

248
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,169
that it's so commercially popular and

249
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,569
everybody's buying and growing and

250
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:50,889
selling cannabis the art and the love

251
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,660
ooh I hope you guys heard that that was

252
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:56,019
some amazing thunder it's finally

253
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:57,639
raining we've needed it but it was my

254
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,960
responsibility now that it's so popular

255
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,730
everyone's worried about the money

256
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,110
they've gotten away from the art and the

257
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,839
pride and they're just doing whatever

258
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,789
they can do to get plants on the ground

259
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,589
pounds out the door and money in the

260
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:10,088
cash register

261
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,110
customers out the door and that's not

262
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,510
really what it's about

263
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,009
so since people have lost the heart

264
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,990
they're not growing from their heart

265
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:18,519
like I try to teach them to do we have

266
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,899
to come up with some sort of testing and

267
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,120
we have to create rules and this is

268
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,379
where we are so it says it's a lot more

269
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,850
difficult than it sounds and it's

270
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,500
expensive Washington liquor bore

271
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,600
Washington's Liquor Control Board

272
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,200
spokesman Brian Smith said about testing

273
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,850
for pesticides as a result unscrupulous

274
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,120
pot growers can use banned chemicals

275
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,830
with little chance of being caught we

276
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,139
were taken by surprise this whole

277
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,150
pesticides taken by surprise this whole

278
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,649
pesticide issue said Ashley Kilroy

279
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,199
Denver's director of Marijuana Policy

280
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:50,919
she was talking to a room about 200 pot

281
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,459
industry workers who had invited in yeah

282
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,379
it doesn't it's missing a word here

283
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:58,659
invited lunch after the invited to a

284
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,100
lunch maybe earlier this month to learn

285
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,299
about pesticide quarantines and rules

286
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,399
sorry they skipped a word of this

287
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,729
article and it totally threw me off it's

288
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,708
just as invited lunch so that's weird

289
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,389
we'll keep going what the growers heard

290
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,729
wasn't encouraging there's no federal

291
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:14,679
agency that will recognize this as a

292
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,778
legitimate crop said Whitney Crenshaw a

293
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,299
Colorado State University entomologist

294
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:21,100
and pesticide expert regulators just

295
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,719
bury their heads and as a result pest

296
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,570
management information regarding this

297
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,399
crop devolves to internet chats and

298
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,010
hearsay and you guys don't want to go

299
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,350
start reading about how to battle bugs

300
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,639
or powdery mildew on a large scale on

301
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,778
the internet because there's so much

302
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,009
[ __ ] that you'll have to feed

303
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:37,629
through that if you don't have a good

304
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,299
base knowledge it'll just confuse you

305
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:42,309
and mess you up even more so marijuana

306
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,229
growers are indeed guessing when they

307
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,208
treat their plans for example one of the

308
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,450
chemicals cited in Denver quarantines a

309
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:51,279
fungicide called eagle 20 is commonly

310
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,050
used on grapes and hops but can become

311
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,539
dangerous when heated and

312
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,549
banned for use on tobacco no research

313
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:00,219
exists on whether the fungicide is safe

314
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:02,069
for use on pot that will be eat now

315
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,710
something I've read recently about

316
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,200
exactly evil 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside

317
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,940
of a perk it goes in the plane is what

318
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,210
it does and it stops the plant from

319
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:18,070
producing powdery mildew and it can last

320
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,389
for 60 to 90 days in the plan so that's

321
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,980
a little crazy if you understand the

322
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,929
plant biology there but also what I've

323
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,000
read is if it gets on your skin it

324
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:28,000
absorbs into your skin and it changes

325
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,620
your RNA and you won't notice it because

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
you might not live long enough to even

327
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,519
notice the changes that occurred in your

328
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,620
body but your grandchildren will be

329
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,569
affected by this your grandchildren will

330
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,360
have birth defects attention deficit

331
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,129
disorders I can't guarantee they will

332
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,230
but that is what this type of chemical

333
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:45,970
does it doesn't [ __ ] you up but it

334
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,980
messes you up in the insides to where

335
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,379
your kids kids are messed up which is

336
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,730
that's got to be some serious dangerous

337
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,379
[ __ ] that I don't want to mess with

338
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,240
I don't want sprayed on my plants I

339
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,460
don't want sprayed on your plants we'll

340
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,750
keep going here several pot growers

341
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,400
interviewed by The Associated Press

342
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,259
agreed that research is needed on

343
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,120
pesticides for pot but they pointed out

344
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,220
that pesticides are widely used on food

345
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,139
crops and that weed consumers have never

346
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,300
before had as much information about the

347
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,769
marijuana they buy it's just like

348
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:14,019
broccoli or spinach or peaches or

349
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:16,449
anything the plant isn't susceptible to

350
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:18,850
certain pests said Gabriel Fair 4th I

351
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,310
think I said that right fair fair worth

352
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,960
anyway who is cultivation manager of

353
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,000
Denver's herbal remedies I apologize for

354
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,070
butchering your name there fair worth

355
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,389
does not use any banned chemicals on his

356
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,100
plants and it was not affected by the

357
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,110
quarantines but he questioned some of

358
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,700
the banned chemicals if you have all

359
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,019
these chemicals that are safe on product

360
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,580
to eat but you can't use them on

361
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,949
marijuana I don't know that I agree with

362
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,050
that the founder of the nation's oldest

363
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,980
marijuana legalization advocacy group

364
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:46,209
Keith Straub of the normal organization

365
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,920
National Organization for the Reform of

366
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,690
Marijuana Laws pointed out that

367
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,969
regulators today are at least starting

368
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,770
to look at marijuana safely in the

369
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,450
1980's the federal government used an

370
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,610
herbicide called paraquat to kill

371
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,560
illicit marijuana crops even though the

372
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,550
poison had been banned from national

373
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,309
forests because of environmental

374
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:04,809
concerns normal complained to the White

375
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,939
House that some of the weeds survived

376
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,949
and was turning up on the street

377
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,080
the response was it's illegal and we

378
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,540
don't have any obligation not to poison

379
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,610
it strop recalled no one was taking us

380
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,199
seriously that is kind of sick that they

381
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,669
poison to this weed the weed made it to

382
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,960
the street and when they said hey this

383
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,610
weeds out there they went not our

384
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,710
problem bro it's illegal don't [ __ ] with

385
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,930
it oh it's tough love from the

386
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,490
government right their recent actions by

387
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:29,469
states with legal weed have been

388
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,509
encouraging if slow he said the idea

389
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,250
that it's been up it's been on the black

390
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,960
market and people are fine so therefore

391
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,450
we don't need testing as absurd Straub

392
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,310
said no one would want to be using a

393
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,820
product that hole has molds or

394
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:44,679
pesticides and that is very true nobody

395
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,390
wants to smoke a product that has mold

396
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,859
or pesticides in it that's just gross

397
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,330
why do you even want to put that into

398
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,310
your body why do you want to put that in

399
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,810
your pipe why do you as a grower why

400
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:54,129
would you want to put that out there why

401
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,539
would you act like you're proud why

402
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:58,779
would you even sell that to somebody

403
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,969
that's just weirdness to me so that

404
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,500
article came from I'm scrolling back up

405
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:17,320
to remember her name it is Kristin Wyatt

406
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:19,389
from The Associated Press drink sorry I

407
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,610
needed a drink alright so as a grower I

408
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,960
find it kind of wrong that people would

409
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,759
even spray some of this [ __ ] on their

410
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,009
plants I don't use anything that is not

411
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,740
completely organic and honestly I avoid

412
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:32,830
using sprays but since I work in agro

413
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,389
and I go to a lot of groves I know that

414
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm putting myself at risk so I need

415
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:39,490
some sort of safety net so I do use

416
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,890
products I try not to use too much neem

417
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,990
oil because neem oil will definitely

418
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,159
affect the flavor of my extracts so

419
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,930
there are certain things that I'll use

420
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,639
certain things that I won't use and

421
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,169
we've definitely been talking about what

422
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,879
we will and won't use at the shop

423
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,009
because there are things that we

424
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,620
definitely do not want to put in our

425
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,600
crop at the shop so I think if you guys

426
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,009
are gonna grow weed or cannabis or pot

427
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,360
or whatever you want to call it think

428
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,279
about who's gonna consume the products

429
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,840
that you're growing our goal is to make

430
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,850
people feel better and not give them

431
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,019
cancer or lung disease alright so don't

432
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,220
spray some [ __ ] on your plants it's

433
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,730
gonna give somebody cancer or lung

434
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,560
disease

435
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,180
don't spray anything on your plants that

436
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,369
you wouldn't spray on your produce and

437
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:17,199
then eat it I think that's what that

438
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,060
should be on a new guideline and also

439
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,040
you guys think about what would happen

440
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,049
if we gave some

441
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,588
products to a person with a compromised

442
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:28,179
immune system I'm a caregiver and one of

443
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,449
my favorite patients I'm a medical

444
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:34,388
marijuana caregiver which means I am I

445
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:36,219
responsible for growing a few people's

446
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,620
medical cannabis and I've got a patient

447
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,829
his name is Doug and Doug's an older

448
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,720
dude he's over 50 years old and he's not

449
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:45,849
in good health since I've known him he's

450
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,149
had three or four major health problems

451
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,649
in just a few years that I've known it I

452
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,259
grow medical cannabis for Doug to make

453
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,750
Doug feel better I grow medical cannabis

454
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,360
for Doug to help Doug live longer I'm

455
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,100
trying to improve Doug's life when I'm

456
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,720
mixing up nutrients and reading the back

457
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,519
of a nutrient bottle I'm kind of

458
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,170
thinking about Doug's lungs I'm thinking

459
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,789
about Doug's heart I think about Doug's

460
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:08,828
kidneys I'm thinking about Doug's hi

461
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,360
think about Doug's because I don't want

462
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:12,609
to kill Doug I want to make Doug feel

463
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,620
better so if I see powdery mildew in a

464
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,209
crop I cut the crop down I cleaned the

465
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,850
room I start over and figure out why I

466
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,619
got powdery mildew if I have to spray

467
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,009
some [ __ ] on there I think about Doug

468
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,289
before I apply anything every I research

469
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,909
I try to be good to myself I try to be

470
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,889
good to Doug I try to be good to anybody

471
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:31,539
else it's gonna smoke this stuff or eat

472
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,940
this stuff or make cash out of the stuff

473
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,458
because it's going into a sick person's

474
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:40,329
body we don't want to kill them we want

475
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:42,009
to make them feel better so a lot of

476
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:43,479
people I wrote this down a lot of people

477
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,409
are gonna have the excuse that they

478
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,350
didn't know they were using some

479
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:49,198
dangerous pesticides like I said earlier

480
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,230
as a grower that is your responsibility

481
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,338
you're supposed to read every bottle

482
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,870
everything that you when you go to the

483
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,519
grocery you should have already read

484
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,399
about that product before you bought it

485
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,539
today read every bottle and then go if

486
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,789
you don't know what that one ingredient

487
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,769
is if you don't know what spinosad is if

488
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,568
you heard me recommend spinosad to get

489
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,129
rid of white flies on the show if you

490
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,048
don't know what spinosad is before you

491
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,309
spray it go read what that [ __ ] is and

492
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,959
understand what you're spraying on your

493
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,818
plants that's your responsibility as a

494
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,679
grower you should have read every bottle

495
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,818
you should have researched everything so

496
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,919
that you know what you're putting into

497
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:23,168
yourself and so that you know what you

498
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,909
are giving to sick people and this

499
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,860
counts even if it's a commercial or a

500
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,650
recreational grow because you don't know

501
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,019
where that product is going to end up

502
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,220
you have no idea who's gonna be smoking

503
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,740
it we don't want to make more people

504
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,269
more sick all right let's work on

505
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,559
healing people you guys be more

506
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,519
responsible with your gross please

507
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,990
that's my point

508
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,789
big shout out to Kristen Wyatt from The

509
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,470
Associated Press also much respect to

510
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,500

news come in my direction you guys it is

512
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,309
7:10 there's some killer Thunder rolling

513
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,469
through my neighborhood right now it

514
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,329
sounds great it is finally cooled off

515
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,850
it's been stupid hot here the past few

516
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:58,349
days it's 7:10 and put myself together a

517
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,329
fat dab I hope you guys are getting a

518
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,250
dad together on the count of five let's

519
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:15,619
do it dad here together you guys one two

520
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:15,619
three that's what I needed

521
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,860
sorry about the silence while I'm dead

522
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,819
but because we're dabbing with me so it

523
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:25,529
wasn't super silent alright so I got an

524
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,059
email recently no this was a Facebook

525
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:30,119
message knows an email I don't remember

526
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,669
I got a message from somebody who

527
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,199
follows me on Facebook and also supports

528
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,759
my periscope because I saw you on

529
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,890
periscope and you reminded me about this

530
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,089
question I appreciate it you guys if

531
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,320
you're not on the periscope app if

532
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,269
you're not checking out periscope you

533
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,889
should definitely do that you can get it

534
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:46,619
on Apple devices you can get it on

535
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:50,310
Android devices the periscope app is fun

536
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,089
you download it go follow me when I come

537
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,859
on live

538
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,269
it'll whistle at you you can open up the

539
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,490
screen and you can watch me rant or

540
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,839
ramble or take dad's or walk through a

541
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,210
grow room or whatever I happen to be

542
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,399
doing that day but the periscope is a

543
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,529
live broadcast and then the video stays

544
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,910
up for 24 hours unless I said something

545
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,700
stupid and then I go delete the whole

546
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,040
video but most of the time I leave it up

547
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,180
so you guys check it out on periscope

548
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,349
I'm coughing from that dab I'm gonna

549
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,490
take a drink then I'm gonna get onto the

550
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:16,490
point to this next topic here

551
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,379
all right big shout out to root beer

552
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,599
alright this next topic is carbon

553
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,020
filters like I was saying my friend sent

554
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,329
me an email asking about carbon filters

555
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:32,519
let me start off by saying that uh the

556
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:34,289
information that you sent me you had an

557
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,049
idea of which carbon filter you wanted

558
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,670
you have chosen the right filter that's

559
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,129
what I think from the info that you gave

560
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,160
me you were talking about getting the 39

561
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,050
inch tall by with either an 8 or a 6

562
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,560
inch duct on it I think that would work

563
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:51,059
perfectly alright blue that Thunder is

564
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,259
so sexy I want to turn off the

565
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,859
compression so that you guys can hear

566
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,930
the Thunder in the background but it's

567
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,519
not loud enough so let's talk about a

568
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,279
little bit about selecting the carbon

569
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,660
filter you guys first of all I should

570
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,339
explain to you what a carbon filter is

571
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,769
maybe you're new maybe you're not

572
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:10,859
familiar a carbon filter is what we use

573
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:13,079
to take the air to take the smell out of

574
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:15,299
the air if the air is leaving your grow

575
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,639
room it's gonna stink like crazy if you

576
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,549
have flowering plants you have a blower

577
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,650
or an inline fan blowing air out of your

578
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,970
grow room because you have to get that

579
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,140
humidity out of there you got to get

580
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,670
that old air out of there

581
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,680
you gotta get some fresh air in there

582
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,230
when you're blowing that old air out it

583
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,210
is going to smell like cannabis it is

584
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,190
gonna stink like a skunk or fruit or

585
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,890
berries it's gonna stink if you're doing

586
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,309
it right so the carbon filter goes on

587
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:43,020
your inline fan and then it goes out of

588
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,250
your facility it bossier out of the

589
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,269
facility and all the air that passes

590
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,940
through the carbon filter will be clean

591
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:52,740
the carbon filter is a cylinder with

592
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,320
activated charcoal in it and it connects

593
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,170
to your inline fan and then it blows air

594
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,359
through there it goes the carbon filter

595
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,920
first and then you can do inline fan or

596
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,139
ducting however you choose but then you

597
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,930
go out of your grow area and the air

598
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,550
that goes through the carbon filter has

599
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,549
all of the contaminants removed and

600
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,799
those contaminants include the odor so

601
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,289
that's basically the stone version of

602
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,149
what a carbon filter is it's a cylinder

603
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,039
with activated parts charcoal it

604
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,660
connects to your inline fan and as the

605
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,589
air goes through it it removes the

606
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,808
contaminated air and odors

607
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:28,269
so now we'll talk a little bit about how

608
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:29,440
to select your carbon filter is this is

609
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,960
the part that our friend needed help

610
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,759
with the goal of your carbon filter and

611
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,909
your blower in your room is to exchange

612
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,970
the air in your grow room every one to

613
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,259
three minutes for best odor control you

614
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,899
guys what that means is you want to take

615
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:45,370
all of the air out of your room if you

616
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:47,109
don't want to empty it then refill it of

617
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,719
course you want to be sucking air out of

618
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:52,209
the room and refilling every one to

619
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,519
three minutes all right so you want to

620
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,288
get the air completely exchanged every

621
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,509
two to three minutes or twenty to thirty

622
00:21:56,288 --> 00:22:02,490
times an hour ish for best odor control

623
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:05,288
so to do that you need to find the cubic

624
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,749
volume of the room and to do that you

625
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:10,298
measure length times width times height

626
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:12,460
all right and that will EQ equal the

627
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:14,288
cubic volume of the room once you know

628
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,079
the cubic volume of your room then you

629
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:20,230
need to get an inline fan that will pull

630
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:23,259
that volume of air 20 to 30 times per

631
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,788
hour through your room and then you'll

632
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:28,269
find a carbon filter that matches that

633
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:30,158
and that's easy because the alright what

634
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,628
you need to do you'll find the cubic

635
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,379
volume of the room right I'm gonna make

636
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:36,819
up a room this room is twelve by twelve

637
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:39,128
that's got a twelve by twelve footprint

638
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:43,710
with an eight-foot ceiling right so that

639
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:46,329
I did the math that comes out to 1152

640
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,399
cubic feet but that's the cubic volume

641
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:53,648
of the room so you want a blower ideally

642
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:59,319
it would pool that would have a CFM

643
00:22:53,648 --> 00:23:00,998
rating of 1152 or close to that if you

644
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:04,778
go look at the vortex fan they actually

645
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:07,269
sell one that is an eleven forty CFM so

646
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:08,980
I would use that on either a six or an

647
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,720
eight inch duct is what I would

648
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,690
recommend and then you would want to

649
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,669
find a carbon filter that is rated for

650
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,499
the same amount of CFM's they come in

651
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:22,090
ranges so you're gonna need a carbon

652
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:26,889
filter that is able to scrub about 1152

653
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:29,709
cubic feet of volume in your room would

654
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:33,490
be ideal you can go half of that which

655
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,319
is about 576 but you don't want to go

656
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,380
much lower than that if you went to a

657
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,329
third

658
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,070
of that you're looking in the three 80s

659
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:43,730
and you're not gonna be pulling enough

660
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:45,079
humidity out that way and it's you may

661
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,549
get the smell out that way but you're

662
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,809
not gonna be cooling the room and you're

663
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,029
definitely not gonna remove enough

664
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,669
humidity of [ __ ] so I'd recommend going

665
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,349
five seventy five to like eleven fifty

666
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:58,190
two maybe of twelve hundred at the max

667
00:23:54,349 --> 00:24:00,139
but that's how you need to select your

668
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,269
blower a blower is that is going to pull

669
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,040
the appropriate amount of air and then

670
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:07,039
the carbon filter will follow the blower

671
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:08,930
make sure you get the right size flange

672
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,329
on there they come in anywhere from a

673
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,009
four all the way up to I think a sixteen

674
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:14,389
is as big as I've seen them I may have

675
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,369
seen an eighteen I'm not sure if I ever

676
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,330
seen that one I've seen that big one in

677
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:23,089
use but so once you find your carbon

678
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:25,519
filter that matches your blower I would

679
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:27,819
recommend that you hang the carbon

680
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,500
filter as high as you can in the room

681
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,960
hang it up as high as you can because

682
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,789
heat rises you want to keep your air

683
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,230
conditioned air down low and you want to

684
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,960
keep your Heat that's up top you want to

685
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,220
suck that out make sure you guys change

686
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,170
out the carbon filter remember they

687
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,720
don't last more than a year maybe two

688
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:48,019
some of them are rechargeable but from

689
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,720
what I have found it's actually much

690
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,970
cheaper to just go buy a new one the

691
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,799
hard part is finding an economical or

692
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,839
not an economical and environmentally

693
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,279
friendly way to get rid of your old

694
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:00,139
carbon filter if you guys have any

695
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,160
suggestions on that you can send me an

696
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,170
email score from your heart at

697
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,080
hotmail.com I would love to share that

698
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,640
information on the show get somebody to

699
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,349
dispose of their carbon filter more

700
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,820
properly I've got a couple lined up in

701
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:13,490
my garage that I don't know what to do

702
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:15,500
with alright you guys I hope that made

703
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,049
sense that was my very quick lesson on

704
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,880
how to select a carbon filter hang it

705
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,500
high you guys if you're gonna hang a big

706
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,630
carbon filter from the roof from the

707
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,970
ceiling I mean make sure you do it

708
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,180
smartly wisely got my grammar is

709
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,579
terrible today make sure you use a stud

710
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,190
and not like a guy like myself or Jesse

711
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:35,990
make sure you find a beam in the room

712
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,279
does do everything smart don't destroy

713
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,529
the house don't hurt yourself especially

714
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,389
hanging a forty pound fifty pound carbon

715
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:42,680
filter above your head that [ __ ] could

716
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,910
fall I don't want it to break you I

717
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,860
don't want it to break your plants I

718
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,870
love you guys I would miss you if you

719
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,909
quit listening definitely hate it if you

720
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:51,619
hurt yourself so be careful safety

721
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,120
first and since I'm talking about that

722
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,500
here's a piece of advice that I don't

723
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,899
talk about often enough somebody was

724
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,759
like hey bro if you could put like one

725
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,200
or two essential pieces of gear and a

726
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,430
grow room that I may have overlooked

727
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,920
what would they be you know what I told

728
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,660
him I said a fire extinguisher on the

729
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,850
outside of the room right outside the

730
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,440
door and a smoke alarm inside of the

731
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,000
room I don't share that information

732
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,340
enough that's something I definitely

733
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,200
recommend put a smoke alarm in there and

734
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,639
then put your fire extinguisher outside

735
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
of the grill room if it's a residential

736
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,180
grow because you don't want to have to

737
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,350
run in the grow room to find the fire

738
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,150
extinguisher in the worst-case scenario

739
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:25,639
you want it right outside so you could

740
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,530
kick open the door start spraying if

741
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,570
that's what needs to be done I hope that

742
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:31,490
never has to happen for you guys but I

743
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,899
hope you do have a fire extinguisher in

744
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,789
the case that you do need it and I hope

745
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,070
you had a smoke alarm to give you some

746
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:38,720
heads up don't be that guy that burned

747
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,919
down your girl all right you guys I feel

748
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,990
like I've been going for about thirty

749
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,220
minutes here let's go click over to the

750
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,980
garage man to see how long we've been

751
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,140
going just about almost 27 minutes I

752
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,210
feel like if I start doing the closing

753
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,400
now we should wrap up right on time for

754
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,809
a 30 minute episode you guys I really

755
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,120
appreciate it you've been listening to

757
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,289

758
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,569
hour-long shows I feel like a lot of you

759
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:04,099
pot smokers have a TV or maybe you just

760
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:06,439

episode and I can see who cuts I can't

764
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,340
see who but I can see that a lot of the

765
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:15,319
listeners cut out at certain times so

766
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,639
I've learned it about 36 minutes is your

767
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,609
attention span so I try to keep them

768
