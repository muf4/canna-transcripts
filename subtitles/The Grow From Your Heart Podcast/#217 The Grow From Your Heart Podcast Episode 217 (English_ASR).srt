21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,159
smoking something delicious with me

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,899
right now I just took a fat dab of some

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,969
bear dance butter from our friends at

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,099
apothecary extracts this stuff is

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,689
delicious I cannot even describe the

26
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,039
flavor of this it's I'm gonna smell it

27
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,259
again just to see if it makes me think

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,719
of something

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,219
you know sometimes some herb has a dryer

30
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,200
sheet sort of a smell this stuff has a

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,629
dryer sheet kind of a smell happening

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,370
something smooth something silky but

33
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,619
then there's a sweet berry taste at the

34
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,420
end of it that I'm really diggin I'm not

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,090
usually a fan of the berry weed but this

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,250
uh that dryer sheet smell on the high

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,740
from this bear dance batter is amazing

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,180
it's got kind of a a cheesecake sort of

39
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,699
a texture it looks like some cheesecake

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,070
batter or some cake batter the dad let

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,960
me take add add a little tiny dab goes a

42
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,269
lot further than you would expect it

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,379
gives a lot of smoke a lot of vapor so

44
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,390
shot it's my friends and apothecary

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,899
extracts for the amazing bear dance

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,159
batter you probably hear that it made me

47
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,320
coffee little bit for some reason the

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,399
day I took made me sneeze you'll hear

49
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,349
that in my throat for a couple of

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,330
seconds but I promise it will I can't

51
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,728
promise you I'm not positive but I'm

52
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,009
fairly certain that will fade away as

53
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,750
time goes on hopefully the high fades a

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,159
little more slowly than the chest

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,479
congestion anyway ah bear dance let's

56
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,310
see let's talk about the bear dance and

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,799
why I bought it I picked this up at

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,390
apothecary on Saturday the reason I

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,490
chose to buy the bear dance is because I

60
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,049
was going to see the remaining members

61
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,520
of the Grateful Dead which are now known

62
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,170
as dead and Coe I thought it would only

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,750
be appropriate to smoke a bear dance

64
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,399
hash at the Dead and company concert so

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,719
uh let's talk a little bit about dead

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,069
encode before we get to some cannabis

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,990
talk here and we are going to talk about

68
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,889
cannabis on this episode I promise you

69
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,689
ah

70
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,000
Saturday I got to see dead and Coe at

71
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,479
Folsom Field in Boulder Colorado it was

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,979
a beautiful day it was a beautiful Drive

73
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,568
Jenny Beth looked super beautiful people

74
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,599
could not quit staring at her all night

75
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:50,818
all day it was a little bit ridiculous

76
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,229
she bought a dress that I showed her

77
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,919
features very well and she looked

78
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,259
[ __ ] great

79
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,969
so that was fun we got up there it was

80
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,639
super sunshiny it was kind of warm it's

81
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,990
actually really nice the riffle dead

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,099
came on I keep calling the Grateful Dead

83
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,730
it wasn't the Grateful Dead it's the

84
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,680
dead and Coe it's

85
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,000
from The Grateful Dead the remaining

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,370
it's through original two drummers

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,409
Mickey Hart and Billy kruseman and then

88
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,090
you got Bobby where original member of

89
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,680
the Grateful Dead and then over there on

90
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,360
bass they've got a dude by the name of

91
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,209
Oteil Burbridge you may have heard of

92
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,860
him dude plays a mean bass then they've

93
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,209
got a dude named Jeff committee on

94
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,680
keyboards and then there's this young

95
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,450
guy that you might have heard of him

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,900
before his name is John Mayer he plays

97
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:30,759
guitar because I've talked about this on

98
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,769
the podcast before a long time ago when

99
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,870
I heard that John Mayer was playing in

100
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,120
Jerry's spa and the Grateful Dead I was

101
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,980
I don't know what the feeling was but I

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,989
doubted it and I wanted to be a hater I

103
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,719
was skeptical I had skeptical hippo eyes

104
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,099
right at the very beginning but I've

105
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,810
gone and seen it a few times now I've

106
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,370
actually caught a few shows of the

107
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,189
newest version of the Grateful Dead and

108
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,509
John Mayer nails it you guys if you want

109
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,849
to be a critic if you want to be a hater

110
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:57,250
go see a show and you will be blown away

111
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:59,199
at the way John Mayer fits in with the

112
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,360
Grateful Dead I made a couple of jokes

113
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,548
though Mayer does bring a younger crowd

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,350
and you can tell who's there to see

115
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,819
Mayer because they don't put their

116
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,590
phones down and they don't shut the [ __ ]

117
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:09,699
up during the concert when I'm seeing

118
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,310
the Grateful Dead or a Grateful Dead

119
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:15,159
style band their jammy they do

120
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,839
psychedelic long extended songs I want

121
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,129
to be able to get in my head into this

122
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,139
little bubble that happens when you're

123
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,668
watching that and not be interrupted and

124
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,839
all these younger kids that are going to

125
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,909
the shows now they want to [ __ ] talk

126
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,009
over the jams they want to ask you what

127
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,720
song they're playing and [ __ ] I'm a

128
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,459
bigot shut the [ __ ] up on Jerry's plan

129
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm gonna go see fish in a couple of

130
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,430
weeks and I might get a shirt made this

131
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,780
has shut up when fish is playing this

132
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,250
because that's how I feel about it I

133
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,359
don't mean to be a [ __ ] about it just

134
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,589
sucks you pay a lot of money to go see

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,629
your favorite band and then some kids

136
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:41,739
are right behind you just talking

137
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,449
through the whole show you'll turn out

138
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,038
to be like a broken even maybe not talk

139
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,449
during this song and then they think

140
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,829
you're a dick because you want to hear

141
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:49,990
whatever song you're trying to hear

142
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,189
anyway overall it was a great time there

143
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,319
were enough cool ass people there to

144
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,379
override all the young kids John Mayer

145
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,459
played the [ __ ] out of the show early in

146
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,870
the show there was a great version of

147
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,029
ramble on Rose

148
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,910
they played a really long version of

149
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:05,829
Dark Star one more Saturday night was

150
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,180
awesome there were tons of great songs

151
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,439
honestly you guys I can't remember all

152
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,030
the songs I haven't been a list here but

153
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,680
unless you're a deadhead you probably

154
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,329
don't care and if you aren't a deadhead

155
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,150
you probably already know what they

156
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,889
played that night so we saw the show

157
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,959
they tore it up one thing I do want to

158
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,729
talk about there their current bass

159
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,899
players named Oteil Burbridge he's

160
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,060
played with bands that you've heard of

161
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:26,560
before he probably I'm trying not to go

162
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,300
too much into the music talking nerd out

163
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,829
because music is one of my my top three

164
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,810
favorite things cannabis and music are

165
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,359
soo my top three favorite things take a

166
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,459
guess what the third one is Oteil saying

167
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,110
china doll this band has been together

168
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,029
for this version of this band has been

169
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,699
together for a couple maybe three years

170
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:44,109
now um I don't remember exactly when

171
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,750
they started but they've been together

172
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,730
for around two or three years and Oteil

173
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,970
has not sang and a few nights ago in

174
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,310
California he's saying China Doll and I

175
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,450
heard a couple of notes I when the band

176
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,829
stops and they start tuning their

177
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,420
guitars and everybody starts hitting the

178
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,159
effects pedals on their guitar to get to

179
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,509
the effects they need and the keyboard

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,310
guy warms up by playing a couple of

181
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,750
notes of the next song I'm really good

182
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,189
at guessing what song it's about to be

183
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,959
just the music nerd to me can spot it

184
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,850
and I looked at Jenny and I was like

185
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,319
they are going to play china doll and I

186
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,240
knew that she was gonna love it because

187
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,250
she loves when they play slow mellow

188
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,949
songs and she's been wanting to hear OTO

189
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,689
sing so I put my arm around her and they

190
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,279
smile I was like she is gonna love this

191
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,360
and we danced together for a couple

192
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,739
seconds then I just kind of stepped

193
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,120
aside and let her just have her moment

194
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,350
she did that thing you know when girls

195
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,639
are super happy and they're not sure if

196
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,629
they want to smile or cry and they put

197
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,740
their hands and kind of like a pray

198
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,180
thing and they just touch their mouth

199
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,949
with it I'm doing it right now for some

200
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,810
reason she did that for the entire

201
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,729
duration of the song it was about six or

202
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,470
eight minutes she just smiled and Bob

203
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,939
back and forth great moment anyway yeah

204
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,980
saw the dead it was awesome they did

205
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,469
china doll one of my favorite parts of

206
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,240
the show they did china cat into i know

207
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,310
you ride her and there's a part in the

208
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,889
song the lion is I wish I were a

209
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,350
headlight on a northbound train I'd sign

210
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,839
my light through that cool Colorado rain

211
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,390
and when they they sing the Colorado

212
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,219
rain part that whole that whole field

213
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,389
erupted with cheer it was [ __ ]

214
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,710
awesome I knew it was coming because I

215
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,879
know the song so I was just looking

216
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,589
around I think this is gonna be [ __ ]

217
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,949
rad and it was pretty damn cool to hear

218
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,789
the whole crowd just go yeah so that was

219
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,589
pretty awesome

220
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,450

227
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,620

232
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:40,000
let's move forward I bought a new

233
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,529
printer why is that significant that is

234
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,168
significant because now I am able to

235
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:46,629
print off the emails that you guys send

236
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:48,129
me and I can bring them to the podcast a

237
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,600
little better than fumbling through my

238
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,939
phone trying to find the appropriate

239
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,650
emails instead of doing that right here

240
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,759
these are the messages I'm gonna read I

241
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,779
don't have to go dig through my phone

242
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,699
there's no [ __ ]

243
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,989
makes me look sound and feel a little

244
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,960
bit more professional so I've got a

245
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,189
printer I'm able to just wirelessly

246
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,019
shoot the messages from my phone right

247
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:08,800
to the printer they come out and read

248
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:10,599
them we can do some [ __ ] I like it so

249
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,210
why throw tis still [ __ ] up from that

250
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,229
dad that I took so I am going to I'm

251
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,698
gonna take a drink and then honestly

252
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,959
I'll probably take another dab and just

253
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,419
chill out for a second till my throat

254
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,549
quits then we'll come back and we will

255
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:23,139
read some of these emails we were gonna

256
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,629
start off with an email from a guy who

257
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,759
calls himself Saint skinny and then

258
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,529
we're gonna work our way through to

259
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,049
godfather cush and then you never know

260
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,269
where we might go after that so ladies

261
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,278
and gentlemen you heat up a nail and

262
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,139
take a DAB and then drink some water or

263
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,360
something natural maybe some kombucha

264
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,088
and I'm going to do the same thing and

265
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,839
with the power of recording magic I will

266
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,339
be back in half a second all right

267

268
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,660

that we were gonna read some emails I've

312
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,019
got them in my hand you hear it here I

313
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,339
feel all professional I feel like Dave

314
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,769
Letterman or Jimmy Fallon

315
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,060
or somebody popular and famous and on TV

316
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,649
I don't watch a lot of TV so I was

317
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,939
trying to fake some names Jimmy Kimmel

318
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,620
is who I was [ __ ] thinking of but it

319
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,850
took me a lot of time to come up with

320
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,560
that but I feel like Jimmy Kimmel or

321
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,879
something I feel like Dave Letterman I'm

322
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,229
flicking my pencil up in the air and let

323
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,669
it do flips and then catching it like a

324
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,330
pimp and then marking down on the paper

325
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,009
what I need

326
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,900

327
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,269

328
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,549

334
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,059
then I've got a printer I assume I

335
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,530
imagine I predict I'll be reading a lot

336
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,009
more emails and I'll get a lot more

337

organized with a lot more [ __ ] also

338
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:08,189
hashtag they like it when we ramble

339
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,110
anyway this message goes like this hey

340
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,210
Jeff and then this dude put in

341
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,669
parentheses you can use my name st.

342
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,889
skinny or st. or skinny to refer to me

343
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:18,269
I'm not a picky dude and he goes on to

344
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,529
say I thought I'd share some of the

345
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,539
music I like to listen to

346
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,579
after getting nice and toasty if you

347
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,889
guys remember I'm the 4:20 episode I

348
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,360
asked people to email me to tweet me to

349
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,799
message me in some way and let me know

350
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,379
what kind of music they listen to after

351
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,329
they smoke it the messages are still

352
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,149
coming in the podcast never goes away

353
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,250
sold people will reply for a long time

354
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,259
and here is what my friend st. skinny

355
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,269
said he said Kottonmouth Kings and

356
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,950
potluck are two of my main jams but I

357
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,679
also like things on the other end of the

358
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,509
spectrum the clashes London's calling is

359
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,219
one of my all-time favorite albums right

360
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,559
up there with Marty Robbins gunfighter

361
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,720
ballads and Johnny Hortons greatest hits

362
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,229
if you don't know Marty Robbins El Paso

363
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,269
is not a great son

364
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,759
type is not a great song but I think he

365
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,069
probably meant ah if you don't know

366
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,110
Marty Robbins El Paso is a great song

367
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,160
with some gorgeous guitar if you don't

368
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,539
know Johnny Horton

369
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,329
I'd suggest the Battle of New Orleans

370
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,250
where they used a gator as a cannon

371
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,450
guess where the powder wait so that

372
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,950
makes more sense the way yeah I think

373
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,470
you just got ahead of himself with it

374
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,900
not in there so uh we've got to check

375
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,340
out some Johnny Horton and some Marty

376
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,500
Robbins you guys had stuff we've got to

377
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,670
listen to Saints Kenny recommended it

378
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,289
give it a listen let me know what you

379
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,149
think I'll give it a listen we'll have

380
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:30,370
like a Rasta Jeff's music club sort of

381
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,750
thing going on here you never know maybe

382
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,360
we'll discover one of our new favorite

383
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,769
bands by finding out what our friends

384
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,110
are listening to through the podcast

385
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,399

386
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,889

387
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,789

388
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,710

389
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,289
hospital and about had her in tears

390
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,060
little things like that mean a lot mama

391
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,980

392
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,979
her bone marrow transplant to fight off

393
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,519
the leukemia so well wishes prayers and

394
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,600

395
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,879
been listening to the show for a while

396
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,920
you guys probably have heard me read the

397
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,509
emails from Saint skinny before and he

398
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,729
was telling us about his mom being in

399
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:08,289
the hospital and I gave her a shout-out

400
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,050
on an episode and she happened to be in

401
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:13,240
the car when Saint skinny was playing

402
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:14,439
the episode she heard it and so I've

403
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,860
been corresponding a little bit through

404
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,230

405
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,389

transplant to fight off leukemia it's

408
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:28,689
got to be a horrible experience I know

409
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,240
that I have never experienced anything

410
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,730
that horrible and I hope I never have to

411
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,259

412

email hey don't be sorry for long emails

493
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,409
sometimes it takes a lot of words to say

494
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,419
how you feel uh if anybody understands

495
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:16,039
that I do it takes a lot of words

496
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,620
sometimes I'm rambling a [ __ ] right now

497
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,328
ah but let's get on with this email he

498
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,980
says I'm a new listener and I dig the

499
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:23,989
show for sure I've listened to all

500
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,028
episodes available on iTunes it must

501
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,350
have been meant to be because as soon as

502
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,208
I ran out and caught up on the current

503
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,000
episodes you posted your first few shows

504
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:34,068
oh you guys if you listen on Thursdays

505
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,379
I post old episodes I've been going and

506
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,969
making you it's usually three episodes

507
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,708
sometimes I can fit four or five and a

508
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,300
three-hour file but I've been going and

509
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,919
getting old episodes and just

510
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,979
sequentially putting them back out in

511
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,379
order and chunks of three because iTunes

512
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,080
and stitcher feet only hold 100 episodes

513
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,789
so ever

514
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,320
I put out a new show something falls out

515
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:54,209
so I'm putting them up in chunks of

516
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,120
three hoping I can get old episodes up

517
00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:02,190
so you can relist it I'm making videos

518
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,890
for the older episode than putting those

519
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,080
on YouTube because eventually the

520
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,750
reposts are gonna fall out of the feet

521
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,250
also and I'm gonna have a lot of content

522
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,200
is what's gonna happen and a lot of the

523
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,440
archives will end up on YouTube and the

524
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,940
most recent 100 ish episodes will be on

525
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,500
iTunes and stitcher

526
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,820
boy what I'm doing is putting out the

527
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,009
old stuff because there's a lot of

528
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,500
valuable content in there a lot of my

529
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:27,900
really written and thought out episodes

530
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,059
weren't about fifty five to a hundred or

531
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,220
some of the most educational stuff that

532
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,329
I put out so they'll be back they'll be

533
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,700
back in the feed they'll be up on

534
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:37,710
YouTube I'm really rambling so I'm gonna

535
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,090
get back to the email here he said I

536
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,950
want you to know that your message and

537
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,809
vibe really come across any positive and

538
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,819
uplifting way your character and

539
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,319
attitude really makes it known that you

540
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,450
were coming from such a real place in

541
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,189
your heart and are a true caregiver I

542
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,900
really like the fact you breathe strains

543
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,940
with patience in mind and you don't just

544
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,860
cross attractive street names for fun I

545
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,450
can only imagine how many people you

546
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,490
were able to bring to enlightenment when

547
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,529
it comes to cannabis breaking stoner

548
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,349
stereotypes is what this world needs and

549
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:06,539

551
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,059
really mean a lot to me I'm not trying

552
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,609

from a real place yes I'm not joking I

556
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,059
love cannabis I've done 217 episodes

557
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,829
I've put them episode out every Monday

558
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,179
for three years because I'm dedicated

559
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:26,879
and I love cannabis I'm coming from a

560
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,080
true place thank you for noticing ah and

561
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,670
I am a true caregiver yes I sometimes I

562
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,980
just sit and listen to my friends talk

563
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,289
and we smoke and I think sometimes just

564
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,089
listening to a guy talk and nodding your

565
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:40,680
head sometimes it's all somebody needs

566
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,449
somebody just wants to be heard

567
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,150
occasionally and if you can provide that

568
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,190
and just also provide a little medical

569
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,740
relief at the same time you're really

570
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,970
doing a lot so being a caregiver yes I

571
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,740
am doing that thank you for noticing

572
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,250
it's not that hard you guys just take a

573
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,480
minute

574
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,490
I just [ __ ] sit down with somebody

575
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,809
you're doing it already you're just

576
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,460
sitting there smoking people anyway go

577
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,659
find somebody that needs some help and

578
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,579
smoke with them and just talk for an

579
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,929
hour you'll feel better you'll feel

580
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,819
like oh man I just sucked up all their

581
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,890
problems but then you might realize like

582
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,240
I don't have those problems and then

583
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,590
you'll be able to help them and everyone

584
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,390
will feel a little bit better so I'm

585
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,619
gonna keep moving he says he likes the

586
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,450
fact that I breathe strains with my

587
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,548
patients in mine and I don't just across

588
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,308
don't just cross for attractive strain

589
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:22,440
names that is true I like to breed with

590
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:23,908
a goal I know what I'm looking for when

591
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,019
I start breeding and I will scrap a

592
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:30,179
project if it sucks trust me I'm not

593
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,909
sure how many people I am able to bring

594
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:36,179
to enlightenment about cannabis but uh I

595
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:37,409
hope just a few people would make me

596
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,389
happy I hope I'm reaching a large

597
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,100
audience but just a few would make me

598
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,629
happy as long as I'm changing one person

599
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,099
a day that that would make me happy if

600
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,450
one person everyday listens and goes you

601
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,668
know what this pothead guy isn't that

602
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,500
bad we might learn some [ __ ] that would

603
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,600
make me happy so breaking stoner

604
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,808
stereotypes is what the world needs yes

605
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,908
it is that's partly why I do this I know

606
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:58,740
I've always been well-spoken and kind of

607
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,778
a speech kind of a guy I've been that

608

my hands on some of your art they have a

625

631
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:49,379

653
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,369
this dude said take a fat dad and give

654
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,050
your mom a hug for me and he told her

655
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:34,079
she'd know what the hell of Rasta Jeff

656
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,849
was it's just me Mom I'm cool I'm

657
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,750
harmless

658
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:39,899
there's so much to talk about here in

659
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,220
this email let's back up Oh God he's got

660
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,280
his hands on some of my art from the

661
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,920
dank team you guys I read genetics seeds

662
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,139
are available at the dank team.com you

663
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,789
can get a few things there they had a

664
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,050
deal for a little while if you spent so

665
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,940
much money you would get some freebies

666
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,680
of cookies and creams cross to arise

667
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,830
which has been named to the cream I'm

668
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,039
not sure that they have that anymore I

669
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:04,769
can announce that I am in talks with a

670
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,230
new vendor and I will soon announce that

671
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:09,930
vendor on the podcast and if you are

672

region that exceeds I have a new vendor

674
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,890
we're working on it they'll get a shout

675
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:18,509
out in the next episode or the next two

676
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,800
episodes depends on how things go I want

677
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,750
to make any promises we're gonna get

678
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,299
that worked out we should have another

679
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,339
avenue for you to get those beans and

680
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,379
they will have the cream available they

681
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,029
will have a rise they will have cascade

682
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,440
they'll have morning dew there'll be

683
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,509
several great things there if we can

684
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,170
work that out you're down there in New

685
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:39,900
Mexico where organic ax is shout out to

686
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,759
my friends Tim and Charlie Charlie jr.

687
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,930
and everybody over at organic oh there's

688
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,099
a bunch of great folks over there I

689
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,259
don't want to miss anybody so I'm just

690
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,209
gonna stop with those three they've got

691
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:50,009
the 30% arise and you're hoping it comes

692
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,180
through on the cookie cross it will it

693
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,589
will come through on the cookie cross

694
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,960
I've got some cream growing in another

695
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:57,209
room and it is frosty as hell

696
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,700
also you may be able to pick up some

697
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,920
seeds and organic ax in the very near

698
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,930
future and they will have a rise and

699
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,279
they will have the cream and they will

700
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,009
have morning dew and they will have

701
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,500
Firefly ah so keep your eyes out for

702
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:12,599
that coming up at organic ax also

703
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,740
sometimes organic uh sells clones so you

704
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,349
may be able to go down there and get a

705
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,870
clone of the arise that is testing at

706
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:20,969
over 30 percent THC it's tested at 35

707
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:23,129
percent THC before the last couple tests

708
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,289
have been closer to 32 they test every

709
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,810
batch and they're getting it dialed and

710
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:29,190
they'll get those 35 s consistently but

711
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:30,149
go down there and check for a clone or

712
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,330
call them maybe they've

713
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,769
a clone for you down at org antica if

714
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,929
you're going to get clones at org antica

715
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:39,569
try to get yourself a Zack Hayes clone

716
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,370
that plant was bred in honor of our

717
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:43,649
friend Zack who passed away from cystic

718
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,659
fibrosis and that plant grows like a

719
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,850
champ smokes like a champ and the

720
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,380
medicine that he creates is potent and

721
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,849
amazing anyway I want to keep moving

722
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,620
with the email sorry I'm rambling today

723
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,109
you said everything really does happen

724
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,729
for a reason yes you're right it truly

725
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,649
does everything does happen for a reason

726
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,960
then you kind of asked me to talk a

727
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,490
little bit about my breeding which is

728
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,140
perfect timing everything does happen

729
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,019
for a reason I got this at just the

730
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,990
right time because I'm on Father's Day I

731
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:13,710
will be doing a little pollination in a

732
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,329
room right now I have got to arise males

733
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,650
that's the same plant I've got two

734
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,439
clones of it because I want to make sure

735
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,060
to have enough pollen I want to sprinkle

736
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,650
a ton of pollen in that room and I also

737
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,240
want to collect a little bit of pollen

738
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,610
to keep in a jar which we will talk

739
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,779
about in a future episode but I've got a

740
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:32,549
rise a male in flower he is dumping

741
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,430
pollen right now he is dripping

742
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:38,159
also I have got let's count there are

743
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,320
approximately 20 females in in the

744
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,480
flowering room they will be ready to

745
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,480
receive pollen on the 18th of this month

746
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,160
around the 18th would be ideal a couple

747
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,809
days before a couple days after would

748
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,250
not hurt but I think the 18th was the

749
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,929
day that I chose I wanted to do it and

750
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,660
that is Father's Day so it's going to

751
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,310
work out very well the girls that will

752
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,840
be in that room the female plants that

753
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:59,490
are in there there's grateful dog in

754
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,679
there the arised a grateful dog makes

755
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:05,309
morning dew there's lemon skunk in there

756
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,680
arise - lemon skunk makes Firefly then

757
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:10,440
stuff I've never done there is a Kalonji

758
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,630
cush so we will have Kalonji cush cross

759
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,150
to arise there's Capleton so you'll have

760
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,750
Capleton cross to arise let me tell you

761
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,300
what those are Kalonji cush is tahoe OG

762
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,400
cross to the grateful dog the Capleton

763
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,769
is white widow cross to the grateful dog

764
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,750
so I'm gonna cross those to the arize I

765
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:30,079
see a lot of great things happening

766
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,460
there they'll put out some really cushy

767
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,529
stinky phenotypes I'm hoping that the

768
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,789
arize male puts a little more weight on

769
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,649
both of them

770
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:40,349
the Kabletown already puts out huge buds

771
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,570
I'm curious to see how big those buds

772
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,219
are gonna get and what that might do

773
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:46,888
also in that same

774
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,899
there's a redheaded stranger I like the

775
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:50,369
way the redheaded stranger grows it

776
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,839
branches out a little more than they

777
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:54,408
arise which I like it would kind of

778
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,480
improve the structure of your eyes so

779
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:59,970
arise and red headed stranger I plan to

780
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,409
call that red rocket there's a flow

781
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,298
plant in there that will take pollen

782
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,039
there's also a platinum tangi a very

783
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,509
small platinum tangi plant I just want

784
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,628
to make a few seeds to play with it see

785
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,679
if I can find a very orange phenotype

786
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:12,538
there are a lot of great plants in there

787
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,850
so I do have a breeding project

788
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:17,788
happening right now the pollination

789
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:18,449
should happen around the 18th you know

790
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:19,970
what I could do

791
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:24,899
I've been trying to think of a good name

792
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:26,730
for flow crossed to the arize I would

793
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:29,219
like to think of a word that means like

794
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,110
the upward flow of energy or uprising

795
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,769
energy I know I just said the word

796
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:36,628
uprising that may work um something so

797
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,990
you guys if you have any suggestions to

798
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:42,928
help me name flow to arise flows the

799
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,909
girl arises the male ah send me your

800
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,559
suggestions you can tweet me at G fyh

801
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,879
podcasts you can send me an e mail it to

802
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,819
grow from your heart at hotmail.com

803
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:52,769
or on Facebook it is the girl from your

804
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:55,048
heart podcast I kind of want to hear

805
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,909
your opinion since I'm talking about it

806
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,440
white widow times the rise needs a name

807
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,778
also there's a white widow girl in that

808
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,389
room so white widow to arise needs a

809
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:04,648
name I've already done that before I've

810
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,240
got seeds of that I've just never

811
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:07,979
bothered to name it I haven't grown the

812
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,599
seeds because I haven't had room there

813
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,548
are only a few of them sometimes I just

814
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,048
run little tiny plants for my first

815
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,038
breeding project then I'll grow them and

816
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,528
see if they're worth a [ __ ] then I'll

817
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,750
make a whole bunch more in the same room

818
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:21,210
for the breeding there is a female Pro

819
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,128
dad Jim is how I think you say it that

820
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,090
was bred by Colin Gordon of the ethos

821
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:29,939
collective uh it is a very orange e it's

822
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:31,740
got like a like an orange cleaner kind

823
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,350
of a smell to it with a little bit of

824
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,700
you know how a car tire shop or any

825
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:37,469
where you get your car worked on has

826
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,569
like a hint of like an oil sort of a

827
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,269
smell it's got that smell to it it's

828
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:44,308
oranges and oil I like it in a sick way

829
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,169
it's got a really great aroma to it so

830
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:48,329
there's a proton geom in there there's a

831
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,269
Jeff Shoji in there so we're gonna need

832
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:53,819
a name for Jeff Shoji to arise and also

833
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,500
there's a hell's og in there so there

834
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,079
will be hell's og cross to arise and I

835
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,059
think I have a name for that

836
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,960
not certain yet but I want to grow it

837
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,220
and see what it looks like but I'm

838
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,500
pretty sure I've got a cool name for

839
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,750
that so those will take pollen on the

840
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,539
18th ish I like to hit the plants with

841
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,849
pollen sometime around day 25 there's a

842
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,829
little window between like the 23 and a

843
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,599
32 ish that they can take pollen it's

844
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:16,819
usually about day 25 that most of them

845
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:19,549
really like it I like to do it when the

846
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:21,319
pistols are nice and fat some people

847
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:22,730
will put the females different females

848
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,259
in the room at different times to time

849
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,059
them some people just throw them all in

850
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:27,980
there at the same time these plants are

851
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,450
kind of small they are not huge plants

852
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,250
I'm not trying to make a whole bunch of

853
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,380
seed I just want to see what some new

854
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,839
crosses do and while I'm at it I'm just

855
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,650
repeating some old crosses to make it a

856
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,879
little bit more seed stock for myself um

857
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,450
so I'm gonna hit all the plants at the

858
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,920
same time on the 18th and then I'll let

859
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,750
them grow for about five or six weeks

860
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,430
and I'll start pulling out one seed from

861
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,710
the bottom of each plant seeing how hard

862
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,180
it is how dark it is looking to see if

863
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,920
it's getting tiger-striped if it's still

864
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,630
white and soft it's obviously not done

865
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,640
when they start getting hard that's when

866
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,470
they're done I'll flush them cut down

867
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,350
the plants let them dry pull the seeds

868
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,150
out and then I will test most of them

869
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:08,059
myself is how I usually do the first

870
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,830
batch I just run them myself it takes me

871
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,569
a little while but then I find what I

872
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:13,789
like and I make more and more and more

873
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:15,619
of those and as I make more I usually

874
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,089
throw a couple of new things in the room

875
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,699
so say I'm trying to make a whole bunch

876
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:22,069
of Firefly I'll do a whole light of

877
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,470
lemon skunk females but then I'll put

878
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:26,359
one of something new in there that's

879
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,160
never been pollinated by the arize just

880
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:29,899
so that I can treat something new while

881
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,450
I'm at it that way I make production

882
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,580
plus a new personal cross to play with

883
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,830
just try to keep things new as a breeder

884
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,299
as a grower you gotta keep it new keeps

885
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:40,730
your mind excited keeps your heart into

886
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,930
it keeps it passionate so that's what

887
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,069
I'm doing with my breeding project I

888
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,019
hope I answered your question their

889
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:48,200
Godfather cush that was a lot of

890
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:50,480
rambling year long email was met with

891
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,009
their long reply I really appreciate it

892
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,259
alright I feel like I've got time for

893
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,910
one more email this one is gonna set me

894
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,769
off on a long rant so I'm gonna press

895
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,080
pause I'm gonna take a drink I'm gonna

896
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,019
take a DAB and then I will be back with

897
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,639
an email about traumatic brain injuries

898
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:06,639
and cannabis use hang tight

899
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:13,179
all right podcast world I am back I I

900
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,109
took way too big of a dab I'm all sweaty

901
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,029
I feel like I am red and uh I am

902
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,709
sweating behind my knees I've never

903
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:24,129
split felt this sweat behind my knee

904
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,750
before but right now I can notice that I

905
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,070
don't know if I have never done that or

906
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,509
if I've just never noticed it or if I'm

907
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:31,269
finally just high enough to notice that

908
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,500
but uh yeah there's sweat back there

909
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,410
I've never done that before I'm wearing

910
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,019
shorts I'm still sweating on my legs

911
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:39,490
that's a good dab anyway before the

912
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,529
break I promised that I would read an

913
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,720
email about traumatic brain injuries

914
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:46,119
because if you've been a longtime

915
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,480
podcast listener you know that in April

916
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:52,719
of 2015 I experienced a traumatic brain

917
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,490
injury I simply hit my head I hit my

918
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,529
head real hard I hit him just the right

919
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,109
spot and I knocked myself clean the [ __ ]

920
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:01,420
out I gave myself a subdural hematoma

921
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:05,979
which is just a big word for I had a

922
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,360
bruise on my brain there is pot there's

923
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,220
your brain and there's a pocket of fluid

924
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,659
and then there's your skull and then

925
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,440
there's your skin and I had like a

926
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,330
bubble between the brain and that layer

927
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,590
of fluid it was kind of acting funny and

928
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:19,960
was putting pressure on parts of my

929
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:23,619
brain that were making me say and think

930
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,720
weird [ __ ] I really [ __ ] me up I am

931
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:28,659
NOT suicidal at this time I've never

932
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,210
really wanted to kill myself but during

933
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,040
that brain injury there were times when

934
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,860
my brain was telling me that I should

935
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,509
hurt myself and I knew better but it was

936
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:40,599
all related to a brain injury

937
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:41,829
I was I was slowed I couldn't speak as

938
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,689
well as normal if you listen to the

939
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:45,129
podcast from that time period April of

940
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,809
2015

941
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:52,020
May of 2015 June 2015 I was goofy I

942
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,309
smacked the [ __ ] out of myself I

943
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,990
couldn't do math properly I couldn't

944
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,569
drive right I couldn't write podcasts

945
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:01,089
properly I was [ __ ] up

946
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:03,179
and it was making my attitude bad and

947
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:05,289
not being able to perform properly and

948
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,330
remember a sentence and remember what

949
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,099
was happening was making me have weird

950
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:12,099
thoughts of doing weird [ __ ] to myself

951
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:15,399
so a traumatic brain injury can [ __ ]

952
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:18,849
your life up um I felt like [ __ ] for

953
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,240
days it felt like so at first I didn't I

954
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,678
couldn't

955
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,599
even tell what was wrong with me I was

956
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,190
so [ __ ] up I was just broken I didn't

957
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:26,619
know which way was up which way was down

958
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,590
I wasn't hungry I wasn't thirsty I

959
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,699
wasn't hot I wasn't cold my friends

960
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:33,099
would have to tell me to drink water

961
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,360
because my my gums would just be stuck

962
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,889
to my teeth like fire marshal bill

963
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,539
remember fire marshal bill had that dumb

964
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,190
expression where his teeth were just

965
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,990
paste it or his gums were pasted to his

966
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,289
teeth I looked like that and didn't even

967
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,609
know it because of a brain injury my my

968
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,710
little signals in my brain that would

969
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:50,349
say hey dude you're thirsty that signal

970
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,660
never went off my net my my would sound

971
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:55,000

972
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,650
be my mouth so dry then my lips and

973
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,359
teeth and my tongue were just all stuck

974
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,880
is one piece I couldn't even tell

975
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:02,678
because I was broken in my brain ah I

976
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,270
would go outside and it was cold as [ __ ]

977
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,950
and I wouldn't even have shoes on

978
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:08,440
everybody else would be shivering and

979
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,850
cold with a jacket oh that's fine out

980
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,160
here they'd like you're [ __ ] crazy

981
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,730
and I didn't get a cold I didn't get

982
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,170
sick from it that was tremendous ahh

983
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,970
there would be times I would just be

984
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,130
sitting here at this table and I would

985
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,480
forget where the [ __ ] I was at what I

986
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,280
was saying better been points on the

987
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,950
podcast when I was recording at that

988
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,389
time were had to stop and rewind and

989
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,009
listen to what I was saying and tried to

990
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,020
figure out what the hell I was even

991
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,359
talking about so I was broken from the

992
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:36,460
traumatic brain injury you guys I have

993
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,409
recovered quite well there are still

994
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,990
problems in my body from that there are

995
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,580
still problems in my brain from it I get

996
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,220
the normal forgetful [ __ ] that people

997
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:46,539
get I get the normal problems that

998
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,058
people have but her like what was that

999
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:50,710
but but I also have other things that I

1000
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:52,359
can tell are from the brain injury

1001
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,970
because they're new and they didn't

1002
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,519
happen before that I went through weird

1003
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,190
attitude changes I was very impulsive

1004
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,450
for a little while I was quite angry for

1005
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,799
a little while I was I was honoring is

1006
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,150
the only word that I could use to

1007
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,800
describe it I was just [ __ ] with

1008
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,119
people and just being a smartass and

1009
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,100
it's trolling people and it was all just

1010
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,200
from a brain injury just triggering me

1011
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,699
to do weird [ __ ] and I read books and

1012
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,559
talked to doctors and I did all the

1013
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,230
right things and the books and the

1014
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,820
internet experiences told me that there

1015
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,260
are phases you go through from a brain

1016
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,869
injury and I was going through them

1017
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,580
properly if I didn't have support from

1018
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,809
my friends and the internet telling me

1019
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:31,168
that [ __ ] was gone right I would have

1020
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:32,289
been really scared because not knowing

1021
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:33,489
there

1022
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:36,610
parts of my life that are missing

1023
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,589
there's from from the month after that I

1024
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,840
probably only know I can put together

1025
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:44,950
one full week of [ __ ] and I don't know

1026
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,440
the rest of it and that is I I may be

1027
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,109
slightly a control freak I'm the boss at

1028
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,789
my job I own my own business I host my

1029
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,070
own show I've got some control freak

1030
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:56,230
[ __ ] going on I did not have that after

1031
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,150
my brain injury and it really [ __ ] me

1032
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,039
up so I want to get to this person's

1033
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,720
email I was just trying to to let

1034
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,250
everybody know I did have a serious

1035
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,989
brain injury so when I talk about this

1036
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,280
I'm not talking out my ass what I was

1037
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,869
getting to it just loop back around I

1038
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,450
know I started saying something it felt

1039
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,219
like somebody had put I first I couldn't

1040
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:14,679
it [ __ ] sucked that was cloudy I

1041
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:16,389
couldn't think then the pain set in on

1042
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,739
day two when I hit my head it didn't

1043
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:20,409
hurt it was just like what the [ __ ]

1044
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:22,359
happened I was out I was confused my

1045
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:25,389
body and my brain weren't connecting the

1046
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,099
next day it [ __ ] hurt it literally

1047
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:31,809
felt like I smacked my head on the wall

1048
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:33,730
and I did and I took a couple dabs and

1049
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:35,259
it made it hurt worse because it

1050
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,670
increased my blood pressure and with

1051
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,910
that increased blood pressure I could

1052
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,190
just feel the head wound just going and

1053
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:43,719
I could [ __ ] hear it one thing I did

1054
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,309
not mention about my brain injury and I

1055
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,739
don't like to talk about it it kind of

1056
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,029
bothers me and it embarrasses me but I

1057
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,479
love you guys and I think you love me

1058
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,860
back

1059
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,019
so if you hear my voice get weird it's

1060
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,780
cuz I'm nervous about this I hear noise

1061
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:57,250
in my head I'm not crazy doctors say

1062
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,690
it's okay they know it's their

1063
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,489
psychologist notes there

1064
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm not [ __ ] hiding it there is noise

1065
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:04,659
in my head it sounds like when you go to

1066
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,550
Guitar Center and that kid doesn't know

1067
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:08,579
how to play the guitars and he plugs it

1068
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,750
in and turns on the app and it goes Kane

1069
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,809
that's what it sounds like in my head

1070
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,550
sometimes not always but sometimes

1071
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:17,049
sometimes it sounds like you know the

1072
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,220
air conditioners just real loud and

1073
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,490
you're trying to hear your friend talk

1074
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:22,899
but the air conditioners just going too

1075
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:24,569
loud or maybe the torch in the

1076
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,460
background like this

1077
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,370
I just hear sound like that let's just

1078
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,260
do my head just like that just

1079
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,119
constantly in my head and it comes and

1080
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,980
goes it's not constant but when it

1081
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,750
starts it could last for days

1082
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,860
so there's [ __ ] like that there are

1083
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,599
effects like that that are still

1084
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,030
happening in my head I'm dealing with it

1085
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,920
and I'm getting a lot better it gets

1086
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,470
better every day I think

1087
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,360
but sometimes [ __ ] pops up so sativa

1088
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:50,519
dads were making my head throb and it

1089
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,620
was making that noise really loud

1090
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,809
Spencer garden of Weeden Spencer and

1091
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,440
Maddy shout out to Spence and Maddy I

1092
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:00,150
went to their house and they're like bro

1093
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,769

1094
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,450
like give me CBD if that's what you

1095
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:05,820
think I need I will do it and they gave

1096
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,039
me a couple dabs of CBD and with the

1097
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,620
first dab so I described the pain it

1098
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,449
felt like I had a belt around my head or

1099
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,849
a vise around my head right around my

1100
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:19,139
temple region and when I took the dabs

1101
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:22,889
of CBD it felt like the belt loosened up

1102
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:26,519
a little it just like ah it just felt so

1103
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:28,019
the CBD was slowly making it loosen up

1104
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,909

1128
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,030
podcast Eminem thanks for the great

1129
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:19,969
email thanks for the opportunity to talk

1130
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,560
about something close to my heart

1131
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:25,079
through my traumatic brain injury

1132
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:29,009
recovery things changed frequently and

1133
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,779
without warning um when I first had the

1134
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,890
injury CBD was what I needed

1135
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:37,530
CBD got me through the recovery and back

1136
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:38,819
to my normal self it made it made the

1137
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,620
swelling in my brain

1138
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,900
calm down and if the swelling didn't go

1139
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,309
down organically there was going to have

1140
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,930
to be a medical procedure done they

1141
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:47,219
would have changed my life they would

1142
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,869
have [ __ ] me up forever that I would

1143
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,029
have been angry about I would not be the

1144
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,799
same person right now had that had to

1145
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,350
happen to me it would have pissed me off

1146
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,920
so much it would I would I I don't want

1147
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:59,309
to talk about it

1148
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,170
but so it really reduced the swelling it

1149
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:04,049
reduced the inflammation in my brain the

1150
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,900
CBD did that for me um once that went

1151
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:09,840
away also let me add that while I was

1152
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,150
doing this CB a-- the CBD I was smoking

1153
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,910
CBD dabs that's how it was working for

1154
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,889
me also let me make a disclaimer just to

1155
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:20,190
cover my ass I'm not a doctor I have no

1156
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:22,409
medical training this is what I have

1157
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,070
done myself and it worked

1158
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:28,500
please don't take me as a doctor consult

1159
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:30,690
a doctor if your friend has a traumatic

1160
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,039
brain injury go to all of the

1161
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,950
neurologist appointments that are

1162
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,989
required share with your doctor that you

1163
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:39,210
were using cannabis along with whatever

1164
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:42,059
medicines they give you I am NOT a

1165
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,949
doctor please be responsible with your

1166
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,960
medical treatment especially with the

1167
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:48,929
brain injury there's not a lot that can

1168
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,789
be done but go get checked out because

1169
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,559
you can have a stroke from [ __ ] there's

1170
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,789
other things that can lead that can come

1171
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,639
from this and you need to be paid

1172
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:58,199
attention to by somebody that knows the

1173
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,789
long term side effects of a brain injury

1174
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,139
so there's one I want to put that out

1175
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:03,119
there I'm not a doctor that's probably

1176
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:06,420
[ __ ] obvious but I have to say that

1177
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,579
please be completely respectful to the

1178
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,110
medical professionals that are treating

1179
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,519
you for this brain injury if you're

1180
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,500
gonna do that I just have to say that I

1181
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,139
believe it and also I have to say it to

1182
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,840
cover my ass so what worked for me to

1183
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:20,909
start with CBD I also added a product

1184
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,100
and I don't work for this company I'm

1185
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:25,980
not pitching them I was taking a product

1186
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,599
called alpha brain from on it which Joe

1187
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,610
Rogan pitches all the time Joe Rogan

1188
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,639
eats alpha brain like their candy

1189
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,840
I was having problems recalling

1190
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,719
information I was having

1191
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,530
word-association problems

1192
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,719
I was with my mom and there was a banana

1193
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,420
on the counter and I wanted the banana

1194
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,099
but I kept calling it a burrito and I

1195
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,530
said mom will you pass me that burrito

1196
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:52,230
and she looked on the counter and there

1197
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,960
was no burrito so she told me there's no

1198
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,460
burrito there and I was like offended I

1199
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,869
was like I can [ __ ] see the burrito

1200
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,730
why are you doing that

1201
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:01,559
give me that burrito and I pointed to it

1202
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,179
and then she looked at me a little bit

1203
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,019
concerned and she said Jeff do you mean

1204
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:09,539
this banana and I was like [ __ ] I do

1205
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,730
mean banana and I was seriously saying

1206
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,529
burrito like I meant it like I was mad

1207
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,170
at my mom for like treating me like a

1208
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,510
fool and that's when she realized you're

1209
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,159
broken like you're not kidding cuz she

1210
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,660
she thought I was exaggerating she I

1211
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,460
told her I hit my head like knocked

1212
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,379
myself clean out I don't remember [ __ ]

1213
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,980
and she's like whatever boys will be

1214
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,300
boys and she I she didn't she didn't

1215
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,650
take it as seriously she should have

1216
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,060
until that moment and then she turned a

1217
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,039
little pale and she realized like my

1218
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,239
kids [ __ ] broken that's when people

1219
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,710
kind of started taking me a little more

1220
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,329
seriously about my broken [ __ ] but I was

1221
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,190
having word-association problems I

1222
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,889
started taking alpha brain they

1223
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,220
recommend two a day I was taking four a

1224
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:48,449
day

1225
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:49,949
because I'm like that first of all if

1226
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:52,109
you say take two it'll fix it I'll take

1227
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:55,230
[ __ ] four I'll be way better that's

1228
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:56,880
just the school I'm from I've won one

1229
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,409
rapid duct tape to fix it the whole damn

1230
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,079
roll ought to fix it real good is the

1231
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:03,750
way I think so I was taking for alpha

1232
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,389
brain and honestly I don't work for that

1233
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,219
company this is serious testimony I feel

1234
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:10,170
like it sped me up because of the time

1235
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:12,299
without it and the time with it when I

1236
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,450
started taking it [ __ ] started coming

1237
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,330
back like routines and patterns and my

1238
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:20,339
daily what I do like I've got dreadlocks

1239
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:22,079
that hang to my butt and I tie them in a

1240
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,180
knot on my head in a very particular way

1241
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,009
that I've been doing for I've had these

1242
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,329
dreads for 13 years I've been tying them

1243
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,610
like that since they could reach I

1244
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:32,639
couldn't figure out how to do it after I

1245
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,800
hit my head imagine that imagine not

1246
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,449
knowing how did whatever basically

1247
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,090
something you do every day probably tie

1248
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,649
your shoes a lot of us kind of our shoes

1249
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,329
[ __ ] lazy tied all mine or lazy

1250
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,349
tights or I could slip them on now I'm

1251
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,000
trying to think of [ __ ] that you do

1252
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:46,619
every day brush your teeth imagine if

1253
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,760
you woke up tomorrow morning and you

1254
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,309
just looked at your toothbrush in your

1255
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,620
toothpaste and you're like

1256
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,909
but sort of it and you're stuck in your

1257
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,259
mouth and poked your cheek a couple

1258
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:56,000
times you're like nope that's not what I

1259
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,560
do with this you got to think about it

1260
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,019
and figure it out I couldn't figure out

1261
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,360
how to tie up my own dreadlocks and I've

1262
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:03,829
been doing it twice a day for the past

1263
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,620
ten years I couldn't figure out how to

1264
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:08,509
[ __ ] do it the Alpha brain made stuff

1265
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:11,529
like that sort of flowing back into my

1266
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:14,030
brain like I missed an appointment uh

1267
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,320
burned from the gross store called me

1268
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,360
she's like hey there's somebody here

1269
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,730
that says you promised you would meet

1270
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,019
them here what's going on I was like

1271
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,960
dude I hit my head I don't even remember

1272
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:25,639
making an appointment and then once I

1273
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,050
started taking the Alpha brain that

1274
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,639
phone call where I made that appointment

1275
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,930
and booked that that came back I was

1276
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,449
like oh I remember that

1277
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:34,539
so CBD and alpha brain are what put me

1278
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:37,429
on the path to recovery

1279
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:41,179
eventually the CBD stopped working and

1280
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:42,079
it made me lethargic and lazy and I know

1281
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:44,869
that sounds weird

1282
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,029
but I'm an energetic peppy guy you could

1283
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:49,819
tell by how much I [ __ ] talk I'm not

1284
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:52,220
lazy I'm usually up first and I'm up

1285
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,950
last also I go to bed last and I wake up

1286
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:56,869
first and I've smoked more dabs and I

1287
00:43:54,949 --> 00:44:00,529
crush I do a lot of [ __ ] work in a

1288
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:04,009
day but the CBD was making me lazy

1289
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:06,830
so I started shifting myself to high THC

1290
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,560
dabs and then the distillate started

1291
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:12,980
coming around this is when like the 98

1292
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,599
and 97 and 99 percent THC distillates

1293
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,139
started coming around so I started

1294
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:22,009
dabbing that and I found that super high

1295
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:24,859
doses of THC through a DAB would make

1296
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:27,530
the noise in my head stop and it would

1297
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,620
make the the uncomfortable out-of-focus

1298
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,360
feeling it would make that go away and I

1299
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:33,500
would be able to and I know this sounds

1300
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,599
really weird but I would be able to

1301
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,380
focus and function a little better when

1302
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,909
I smoked a super high THC dad now I can

1303
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:44,570
tell that my brain is getting much

1304
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:46,250
better and much more healthy my thought

1305
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,220
patterns are much longer they're like

1306
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:50,869
they used to be again my paragraphs when

1307
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,549
I write a podcast or when I write an

1308
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:55,130
email my paragraphs are actually [ __ ]

1309
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,480
paragraphs again I have a beginning a

1310
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,710
middle and an end when I'm telling a

1311
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,380
story now back in the day I would just

1312
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:02,579
ramble but what I'm noticing is now that

1313
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,130
my brain is not injured so much I'm gay

1314
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:07,409
really high when I smoke good THC hash

1315
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,300
there are days when I can tell my brain

1316
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:10,889
is a little funky and I think you guys

1317
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,600
can tell when I record also when I have

1318
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:14,309
a funky brain day people around me can

1319
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:15,900
tell but the people that know me they

1320
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:17,250
know and they know that I'm staying away

1321
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,519
from them because I'm having a funky

1322
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:25,940
brain day but on the funky brain days if

1323
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:29,880
I dip high THC shatter into really

1324
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:33,030
limonene dominant Terps my head troubles

1325
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,010
just chill the [ __ ] out and I'm really

1326
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,480
lucky that I figured that out and it

1327
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,730
took talking to a few people with head

1328
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,440
injuries and it took a lot of buying and

1329
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:43,380
smoking of a lot of [ __ ] to figure it

1330
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,470
out but that's what works for me so I

1331
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:49,110
don't know exactly what's gonna work for

1332
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:50,699
your friend CBD should work in the

1333
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,680
beginning to help reduce the

1334
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,529
inflammation and sometimes when you've

1335
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,419
got a brain injury or any kind of

1336
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,190
swelling on the body too much THC will

1337
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,460
make your heart race and that'll just

1338
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:04,200
make that bruised area that injured area

1339
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,610
it'll just make it throb and swell a

1340
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:07,799
little bit more and it'll make it hurt

1341
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,809
make it uncomfortable and that just that

1342
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,250
then that gets to your head and then it

1343
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,389
makes it hurt more and then it gets to

1344
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,650
your head again and it makes it hurt

1345
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:15,599
more and it's a [ __ ] up hour and a

1346
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,750
half of being high and an unnecessary

1347
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,969
pain so if you're gonna smoke CBD if he

1348
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,670
is gonna smoke CBD I would recommend go

1349
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:25,709
really our THC let me restart that whole

1350
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,360
[ __ ] statement if your friend with a

1351
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,490
traumatic brain injury is going to

1352
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,410
choose to smoke THC go light in the

1353
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:33,689
beginning because it may increase the

1354
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:36,599
pain I highly recommend starting off

1355
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,369
with CBD if he's been smoking if he's

1356
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,279
already a cannabis user if he's already

1357
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:43,079
a medical patient a pothead whatever go

1358
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,410
heavy with the CBD treatments and he'll

1359
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,039
be just fine see how that does if it's

1360
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:50,969
working

1361
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,469
do it go harder if you want to I don't

1362
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:54,089
know how he feels about edibles the

1363
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,369
edibles are gonna come on a lot stronger

1364
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,800
they're gonna last a lot longer so smoke

1365
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:59,489
a little CBD see how you like it then if

1366
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,250
it's working

1367
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:04,109
start doing edibles Oh like I'm saying

1368
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,630
eventually maybe that CBD is gonna wear

1369
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,300
off as the brain injury progresses this

1370
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,849
is what worked for me then shifted THC

1371
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,860
when that THC isn't working smoke CBD

1372
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,360
again just balance it out you're gonna

1373
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,829
have to experiment he's gonna be a

1374
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,539
guinea pig because

1375
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:21,429
his motherboard is broken you know what

1376
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:22,929
I mean like he so the computer doesn't

1377
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:24,489
work the way it should anymore so maybe

1378
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:26,679
the things that should work for him

1379
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,000
aren't going to and the things that you

1380
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,859
would never think would work might

1381
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,139
because the computer has been a little

1382
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,059
bit reprogrammed so be patient with him

1383
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:35,949
as a friend just be there for him he's

1384
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,619
gonna say some weird [ __ ] uh

1385
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:40,509
just listen and just don't scare him

1386
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,710
don't point it out cuz it used to [ __ ]

1387
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,450
with me when my friends would be like

1388
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,269
dude you're actin [ __ ] it would make

1389
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:49,299
me feel weird so just treat him right

1390
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:51,369
make sure the dude is not suicidal is

1391
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,010
after a brain injury suicidal thoughts

1392
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,719
creep into your head because you have I

1393
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,970
try to fight is this the appropriate

1394
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,469
word of [ __ ] you feel [ __ ]

1395
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,569
because you are [ __ ] your thought

1396
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,879
process has been [ __ ] so you feel

1397
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,110
[ __ ] and you lose confidence in

1398
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,849
yourself and your life isn't what it

1399
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,920
used to be and it's hard to deal with

1400
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,659
so it puts the thought on the back of

1401
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,280
your head if I'm gonna feel like this

1402
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:14,109
every day and be [ __ ] I might just

1403
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,519
not have to do this anymore so make sure

1404
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,490
your friend doesn't get in that space

1405
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm lucky that I've got great friends my

1406
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:21,219
friends love me my mom loves me

1407
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,500
everybody kept a good eye on me so that

1408
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:25,569
was not even a [ __ ] option for me but

1409
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,210
it does happen with a lot of people we

1410
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,309
see it in football players uh sports

1411
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,409
folks athletes who get traumatic brain

1412
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:34,420
injuries they kill themselves a lot and

1413
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,949
it's because your brain is so [ __ ] up

1414
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,079
you can't think right the motherboard is

1415
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:39,639
[ __ ] up the CD is skipping you got to

1416
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,710
find a way to stop the CD from skipping

1417
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:43,719
and unfortunately some suicide is a way

1418
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:47,440
to do it so that's something you could

1419
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:48,839
really do is just be there for him uh he

1420
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,639
said he was in a motorcycle accident

1421
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,920
there's probably going to be some PTSD

1422
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,869
involved in an accident involved in a

1423
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,809
motorcycle involved in the sounds of a

1424
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:00,969
motorcycle so be gentle with that my

1425
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:03,880
traumatic brain injury was caused by a

1426
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:06,699
[ __ ] doorway I was I'm six and a half

1427
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,190
feet tall and this old part of town it

1428
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:12,099
was built by old people from different

1429
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,900
descent I only know the we have a

1430
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:15,369
derogatory word for them that everybody

1431
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,980
just uses here like it's [ __ ] normal

1432
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,199
even them they made it up I think people

1433
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,019
of slavic descent built small houses in

1434
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:24,879
this old part of town so the doorways

1435
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,769
are low and i tried to go through a

1436
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,990
slovenian doorway and I'm a german boy

1437
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:30,739
and it didn't [ __ ] fit kapow was

1438
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:33,289
knocked out now when I am at

1439
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:35,118
work in the grow and I'm standing up if

1440
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:37,639
I kneel down to pick something up when I

1441
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,980
stand up I stand up really slowly and

1442
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,269
after about my fourth day there one of

1443
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,349
my co-workers is like bro why do you

1444
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,940
stand up like that when you kneel down

1445
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:45,710
and I was like I have a traumatic brain

1446
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,690
injury and I'm afraid and he's like oh

1447
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,550
[ __ ] yeah it only takes one and they all

1448
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,400
realized why now they watch me like they

1449
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,350
notice that I'm keeping my head safe cuz

1450
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,539
after one I don't I don't want to do it

1451
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:58,909
again and I don't know if my brain could

1452
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:01,670
take it again I might not survive that

1453
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:03,529

1466

00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,820

00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:05,289

1485

yeah protect your head you guys [ __ ]

1487
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,489
reading this about the traumatic brain

1488
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:14,789
injury really got me riled up and got me

1489
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:16,318
ranting but uh you say you want to grow

1490
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:18,869
some cannabis for him if you need

1491
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:21,239
something with high CBD I can probably

1492
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:24,778
recommend Tora Bora from DNA genetics

1493
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,759
Pennywise from TGA sub cool seeds there

1494
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:29,338
are probably tons of other high CBD

1495
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,130
strains out there you may be able to

1496
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:33,210
reach out to somebody on the Facebook

1497
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,660
community and the Instagram community

1498
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:38,250
and you may be able to find free seeds

1499
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:40,440
that are high in CBD if that's your goal

1500
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:42,150
it may be possible reach out to me if

1501
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,940
you can't do it maybe I'll help you out

1502
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,099
I'll do it we can also you said what

1503
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,139
strains are beneficial and what method

1504
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,940
of ingestion is best I would start with

1505
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:53,750
smoking if your friend has been a smoker

1506
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,639
before roll in the joint load i'ma ball

1507
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,380
if they are if he's been a heavy smoker

1508
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,298
before I keep saying he it could be a

1509
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,700
sheet let's see a friend of mine was in

1510
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:03,809
an accident and had you said he all

1511
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:05,250
right I just want to make sure I don't

1512
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:07,769
wanna be sexist on accident I'm trying

1513
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,659
to be more sensitive ah if they've been

1514
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:11,939
if he's a smoker before give him a DAB

1515
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,578
because I think a DAB is good because

1516
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,679
you see immediate results like there's

1517
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,660
so much it's concentrated so when you

1518
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,278
take a dab of it you're gonna get the

1519
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:22,078
results immediately you'll know if it

1520
00:52:20,278 --> 00:52:24,119
works you'll know if it doesn't and then

1521
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,619
you can go from there quickly with

1522
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,970
flowers it's gonna take a few more

1523
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,730
inhales depending on the person's

1524
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:31,949
tolerance but I would start with flowers

1525
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,490
find out how those work find out what

1526
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:36,899
you need excuse me I've been switch to

1527
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:38,429
concentrates or edibles just to be able

1528
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,309
to deliver the medicine more properly

1529
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:42,929
they do make a patch if you are in a

1530
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:45,119
medicinal state it's not you said

1531
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:47,788
treated at a Craig Hospital possibly

1532
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,460
Craig Colorado the patches are great the

1533
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:53,309
transdermal patches the CBD patches you

1534
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,869
can put those wherever it hurts so that

1535
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:56,579
is very useful I don't know if you could

1536
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:58,559
put them on your head if you've got hair

1537
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:01,470
but maybe on your lower neck something

1538
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,509
like that would work for you but you got

1539
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:06,149
to start out with smoking smoking works

1540
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:07,679
right away and also it's the easiest to

1541
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,240
shake off if you eat edibles it's gonna

1542
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,949
last a long time if you get it if you

1543
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,568
take a DAB it's gonna last a while if

1544
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:14,308
you take one or two puffs off a pipe and

1545
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,750
it goes the wrong way it's not gonna

1546
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:16,950
take a long time to get that out of you

1547
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,108
a couple of peanut butter and jelly

1548
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:19,500
sandwiches maybe something to drink you

1549
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:21,000
should be

1550
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,190
fine pretty soon wouldn't be too

1551
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,349
uncomfortable for most people all right

1552
