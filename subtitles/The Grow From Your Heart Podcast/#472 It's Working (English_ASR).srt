feminized or Auto flower seeds in your

and you can find them at

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:38,700
www.cdxzipstream.com the label the

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,590
flavor is described as sour fruit and

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,780
fuel I would definitely agree with the

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,300
fruity fuel part I'm not sure I get the

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,250
sour still a delicious and impressive

14
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,479
concentrate I'm gonna bust it open so I

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,600
can talk about the appearance and

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,429
consistency there are three perfect dab

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,379
size diamonds in here there were four or

18
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,939
five diamonds in here I am NOT going to

19
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,829
crush them up I'm going to take them as

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,079
individual tabs that means that this

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,549
gram will be five dabs there's just

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,739
enough Terp sauce in here to make it

23
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,950
delicious on the back of the container

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,530
it says that this product does contain

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,960
60.9 5 percent THC non detectable

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,450
amounts of CBD I am sure that the

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,389
remainder of that percentage is mostly

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,879
terpenes this product smells delicious

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,978

be spam and spiteful so we are standing

81
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:16,680

82
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,840

86
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,139
show I'm going to jump right into the

87
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,029
first Apple podcast customer

88
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,468
view of this episode I may have read

89
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,538
this one already honestly I don't

90
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:35,180
remember the last review I read this one

91
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:37,639
came in on August 6th from a person who

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,098
calls themselves Irie army six one nine

93
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,050
they gave us a five-star rating

94
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,610
I cannot read the full headline of the

95
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,759
review it starts off with great show

96
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,110
listen and learn then the thing gets cut

97
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,629
off here but then it continues there is

98
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,729
a full review it says Rasta Jeff is the

99
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,830
man his love for the plant and cannabis

100
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:56,688
community are very evident in every

101
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,430
episode and that means a lot to me

102
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,400
already this is a great review the whole

103
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,560
podcast uses passion and knowledge I

104
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,658
appreciate that both new growers and

105
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,550
experienced growers can learn something

106
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:09,438
from Rasta Jeff and they grow from your

107
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,090
heart pod cast man that is my exact goal

108
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,919
I'm trying to teach the new growers I'm

109
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,299

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,189
review goes a lot like this I love your

168
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:18,319
podcast super helpful when I listen to

169
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,639
the grow lessons I take notes oh I have

170
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,860
to refresh the page because the review

171
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,949
just disappeared there we go it keeps on

172
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,230
going it says I take notes lots of info

173
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,029
don't stop making podcasts you're full

174
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,340
of knowledge and it's always great to

175
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,779
hear someone new and don't give up I

176
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,168
want to be listening till you get to

177
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,969
Episode one thousand while one thousand

178
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:39,649
episodes would be cool I'm almost up to

179
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,790
five hundred I think I'm about twenty

180
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,189
five away I don't remember what number

181
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,800
we're on here twenty five I'm 28

182
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:47,899
episodes away from being at 500 I think

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,060
a thousand is a reasonable goal I do not

184
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,889
see a reason to stop recording or making

185
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,360
podcasts as long as people keep

186
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,189
listening as long as the service is

187
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,020
still available as long as they don't

188
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,430
make some weird legal thing or some

189
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,259
changes to podcasts where they have to

190
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,000
be paid for or I have to pay to do it

191
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:04,099
then we should keep the go the show

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
going forever I don't see a reason to

193
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,030
stop and even if they do make me pay to

194
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,469
produce podcast I will still do it

195
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,299
because you guys support me quite well

196
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,130
and you've supported me for so long but

197
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,199
I would still continue to do it even if

198
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,459
it did cost me a little bit it does cost

199
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,370
me a little of course to host the

200
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:21,379
website to have all the equipment and

201
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,910
all that but patreon covers that so

202
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,560
thank you I want to keep going with this

203
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,560
review let's get back into it it says I

204
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,899
hope you don't give up and keep it up I

205
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,149
do not plan on giving it up there is no

206
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,009
reason to give up podcasting this is fun

207
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,799
I've got a lot of passion for this and

208
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:39,439
then every episode I put out I get at

209
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,478
least 12 or 15 replies on YouTube from

210
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,190
people saying great job thanks for all

211
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,810
of the help then I get a bunch of emails

212
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,550
from people saying wow you really solved

213
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,709
my problem in my grow it is very

214
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:51,229
rewarding so there is no reason to stop

215
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,459
doing the show I am [ __ ] rambly let's

216
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,659
keep going we've got some more reviews

217
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,719
to get through this one was left

218
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:00,539
on September 16th of 2019 by a person

219
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,850
who calls themselves Dean two to one the

220
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,649
headline is great I like that because it

221
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,540
fits in a little short spot they give

222
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,639
you now but our new friend gave us a

223
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,379
five-star rating I am opening the review

224
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,669
I have to refresh the screen again

225
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,319
because for some reason the reviews

226
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,878
disappear once you click on them you got

227
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,318
to unclick and click something else and

228
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,300
then go back to it that review is still

229
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:19,620
not there there's a blank space where

230
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,208
the review used to be there we go it

231
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,589
just popped back up I know I sound crazy

232
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,539
but if you're playing with the Apple

233
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,009
podcast application you'll see what I'm

234
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,139
talking about the new update is a little

235
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,959
weird that's why we're doing a test run

236
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,060
with this episode so it says most

237
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,679
informative and entertaining crow show

238
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,778
ever I appreciate that

239
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,068
rhasta Jeff is my hero that's [ __ ]

240
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:39,750
cool thank you I appreciate that

241
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:41,818
ah that's kind of scary but I do

242
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,039
appreciate it it also says I'm brand new

243
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:47,490
to stealth growing personal medicine and

244
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,188
I listen constantly I'm 63 and I feel

245
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:53,159
born again thanks Ross to Jeff man that

246
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:55,019
is kind of cool ah 63 and feels born

247
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,179
again thanks to this podcast and to

248
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,438
being able to grow personal cannabis

249
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,629
that is [ __ ] cool I appreciate that

250
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:02,849
that's my favorite review of the day it

251
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,429
goes on to say I want to reiterate Jeff

252
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,159
is so interesting just checking to see

253
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:11,578
if I can get Jeff another good review he

254
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,899
is a fascinating listen best ever man

255
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,359
that is really cool I appreciate that

256
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,039
not only am i delivering quality content

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,990
but this person feels that I am

258
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,028
interesting I didn't realize that was an

259
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,438
interesting person I do know that I've

260
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,000
got some cannabis knowledge I do know

261
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:25,588
that I talk too much but I did not

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,750
realize that other people found me

263
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,089
interesting outside of that so that is

264
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,318
really refreshing reassuring or

265
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,790
something like that I don't know what it

266
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:34,229
is but it feels good and it gives me

267
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:36,028
confidence so I want to thank you for

268
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,649
the great review and thanks again for

269
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:39,419
saying that I am an interesting person I

270
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,068
don't think I realized that people find

271
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,479
me interesting so thank you I appreciate

272
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,938
that big shout out to our new friend

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,759
Dean two-two-one who of course left a

274
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:49,469
five-star review I've got a couple of

275
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,028
more reviews left here on the screen I

276
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,620
know I'm talking really quickly I'm

277
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:55,019
going to blame that on a little bit of

278
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,539
caffeine and a whole lot of dogfighter

279
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,250
dabs from our friends at Green Dot let's

280
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,818

September 28th of 2019 by a person who

282
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:07,049
calls themselves I can't tell if that's

283

292
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,129
want to get the new growers I want to

293

00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,189
say I love the girl episodes and the

300
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,620
push for activism to free the plant I am

301
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,630
a veteran who prefers organic medicine

302
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,690
thank you so much for what you have done

303

yourself

307
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,329
with my guidance I know I don't talk a

308
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,490
lot about or a lot about organic growing

309
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,770
I'm more of a a bottled nutrient of

310

unless it's cannabis related I really

326
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:37,289
avoid talking about politics on this

327
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,970
show I don't share my political views or

328
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,219
ideals on this podcast because that is

to me that I'm hitting my goal you guys

391
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,970
when you set out to do something and

392
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,890
you're not sure if you're getting it

393
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,620
right or not and a bunch of people say

394
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,120
best for beginners and experts and your

395
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,409
whole goal was to get for beginners and

396
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720

397

my chair right now I'm just doing a

399
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,669
little boogie don't even try to

400
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,409
visualize it it's [ __ ] goofy the

401
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,870
review goes I've learned so much and

402
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:19,379
laughed along the way again

403
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,750
that is my goal I was a bad student in

404
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,309
school I've got a TD like you would not

405
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,320
believe I'm sure you can tell just by

406
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,169
listening to me speak that my attention

407
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,640
goes crazy but I love to learn I love

408
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,620
filling my brain with knowledge and

409
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,629
useful facts I just don't want to learn

410
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,070
the dumb useless crap that we keep

411
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,610
repeating in school and I had to learn

412
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,290
over

413
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,810
/ I already know that teach me something

414
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:42,990
new let me learn expand my mind so I

415
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:45,389
hated school I had a few teachers that

416
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,159
made an effort to actually teach us they

417
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,990
weren't just reciting [ __ ] out of a

418
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,730
workbook and making us [ __ ] do

419
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,490
assignments they were making an effort

420
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,100
to be teachers to shape us as people for

421
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,740
the future those teachers I remember

422
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,930
them a lot of them were funny a lot of

423
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,759
them had a personality with which I

424
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:04,319
could connect that was harder to say

425
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,909
than it should have been but those

426
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,160
teachers are the teachers that made an

427
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:09,778
impact on me not the teachers that stood

428
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,370
in front of the class and droned on and

429
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,320
bored the [ __ ] out of me I don't

430
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,700
remember any of those teachers or their

431
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,220
classes there are a few teachers I

432
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,870
remember vividly because we connect it I

433
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,250
feel like if you connect with me a

434
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,528
little bit if I connect with you a

435
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,389
little bit I can teach you a lot and a

436
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,889
little bit of laughter makes you put

437
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,600
your guard down you get comfortable with

438
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,730
me and then you want to learn you put

439
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,230
down that a school you forget that

440
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,940
you're learning you're laughing and

441
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,800
you're absorbing information so I think

442
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,200
that a little bit of laughter and a lot

443
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,669
of Education is a perfect mix and I am

444
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,740

episode but I've gotten a couple of

emails that these episodes are not

484
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,150
people's favorites they would rather me

485
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:04,980
focus in on gross stuff which does make

486
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,960
sense this is the growth from your heart

487
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,480
podcasts not the review from your heart

488
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,490
podcast this is a Thursday episode and

489
