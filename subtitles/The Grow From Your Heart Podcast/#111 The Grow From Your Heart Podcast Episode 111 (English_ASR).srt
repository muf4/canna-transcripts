166
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,038
room

167
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,329
let's tell us a little bit about what

168
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,560
happens when you have consumed the

169
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:21,479
mother's milk how do you like this stuff

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,360
is a from the teat it is a smokeless

171
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:27,730
immediate type of effect we're like

172
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,620
literally after like three or four sips

173
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,410
or like a couple straws worth you can

174
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,918
feel it and if the drink is potent

175
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,620
enough within five to ten minutes you're

176
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,349
at you know pretty much euphoria and it

177
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,180
also can pounds itself are some sort of

178
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,090
like multiplier where it's like if

179
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,400
there's 60 milligrams in the cup it

180
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:53,529
really feels like 200 milligrams when

181
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:55,509
you drink it and some batches in the R&amp;D

182
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:58,269
phase were extremely chirpy and

183
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:01,959
unpleasant and other batches have been

184
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,250
refined into perfection very nice very

185
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,839

jiu-jitsu don't work on dear bro I can I

223
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,278
even ask you about the clear am I

224
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,420
allowed to ask what can you tell me

225
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,610
about the clear a lot of my listeners

226
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:12,769
this is listen to people have listened

227
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,659
to by people from all over the world not

228
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,578
just people in Colorado or Kali's it's

229
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,969
up a lot of the people listening have a

230
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:21,049
hard time finding pot so the clear if

231
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,850
you just want to tell them kind of

232
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,500
basically they know if they probably

233
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,970
know about shatter and basic hashes from

234
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,649
listening gonna give them an update on

235
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,160
what the clear actually is that'd be

236
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,269
awesome

237
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:37,278
so clear is is a brand of product that

238
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:42,519
we in California and it was sort of the

239
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:48,649
first like I guess popularized a

240
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:51,759
purified cannabis oil that it was always

241
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:54,589
a nice high clarity and like low color

242
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:59,088
and you know kind of we're one of the

243
00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:02,480
first quote solvent-free companies so

244
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,880
people have their own ways of making

245
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,199
these activated cannabinoids decolorized

246
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,938
and stuff and so we don't really speak

247
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:10,009
to how we do it just keep it always a

248
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:12,289
secret much respect so other people do

249
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,240
it and tell you how they do it but as

250
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,899
far as us we we kind of stick to just a

251
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,370
purification method and we have our own

252
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,110
particulars as to what machines we use

253
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,429
we build a lot of our own machines and

254
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,949
have our own processes and things like

255
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:27,258
that so it's kind of just particulars

256
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:29,389
and we have our own like unique flavors

257
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,870
that we then blend back in all natural

258
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,459
flavors that can range from cannabis

259
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,129
type flavors that have high doping

260
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:39,169
content to like you know your standard

261
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,480
your grape and you know we have sort of

262
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:43,459
a flavor department that we we know pump

263
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,350
out just flavors and try to keep our

264
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,030
those flavors derived from cannabis or

265
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,590
other products so they're all derived

266
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:50,149
from other products okay everything's

267
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,470
natural and none of them are like

268
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,000
everything you know for instance the

269
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,250
terpenes that we use are steam distilled

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,830
and all the flavors we use are you know

271
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:02,559
high grade and are all you know based

272
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,560
off of like a lot of essential oils and

273
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,850
we try to make sure things I've talked

274
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,799
to you for a couple hours and I trust

275
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,759
you I trust your judgment on that kind

276
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,259
of product so far there's a lot of you

277
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,759
know great uses for products like this

278
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,189
we can use them for topicals and edibles

279
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,679
and vapor cartridge isn't anything you

280
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,210
can really want to you know formulate so

281
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,349
it's kind of cool right I hear a lot of

282
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,870
good things about the clear we'll have

283
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,220
to get our hands on some I think that's

284
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,360

328
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,360
out there and help create their brand

329
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,780
which is you know one of the first you

330
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,789
know they'll have some of the first

331
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,379
infused products available in the

332
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,519
Illinois medical cannabis market and

333
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,950

334
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,980
legal butane extractions to be dies in

335
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,830

341
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,900

of that and if I'm out of line just let

374
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,870
me know and I won't ask the question how

375
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,450
much of that product will actually be

376
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,129
sold as smokeable Earl and how much is

377
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,259
it will be sold to a vendor and turned

378
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,610
into something like a topical or an

379
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,080
edible or something I would say a

380
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,669
hundred percent of that will be sold as

381
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:23,060
smokeable oil you know it's we you know

382
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,769
we take pretty we take pretty good steps

383
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:27,799
in the grow to make sure that you know

384
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,389
we have really high quality we were able

385
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,759
to let people you know experience the

386
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,740
flowers but the fact that we can take

387
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,950
all that high quality flower product and

388
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,720
turn it into extract you know we want to

389
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,050
get as much of that branded tur PEX

390
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,060
awesome dog run flavor on the market as

391
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,039
possible so I would say most of that

392
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,019
product will be sold as smokeable oil if

393
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,549
we start delving into other products and

394
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:53,449
find that you know it's more beneficial

395
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,859
to do things that way you know maybe

396
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,528
we're working to that now but right now

397
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,500
the plan is to just make grandma dad or

398
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:01,879
wax live resin maybe some bubble 5 resin

399
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,200
you want to talk about wive resin for a

400
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,199
minute I heard you say something to a

401
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,578
client earlier the bottom line bro what

402
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,900
makes it live resin and what doesn't

403
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,399
just I've said this on the show and

404
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,400
people call me a hater well it makes it

405
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,500
live resin the fact that it's a live

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,380
plant that's cut down and then frozen

407
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,720
before it is dried then what machine do

408
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,870
you run it through we personally use an

409
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,588
emo tech at our Colorado operations as

410
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,558
well as the ones that we'll use and

411
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:31,418
and Illinois see guys I didn't even say

412
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,428
I didn't bait him we just let him say

413
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:37,120
his thing and he backed up everything I

414
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,528
have said nice thank you bro so what the

415
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,908
question really comes down to there are

416
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:41,500
some like little small distinctions and

417
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,350
like live resin some people will dry

418
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,000
like a slight bit and then freeze versus

419
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:48,158
like a full dry how do you feel do you

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,990
consider that any drawing it's the

421
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:53,640
immediate cut and freeze because some

422
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,640
people complain about like tubes o'clock

423
00:17:55,528 --> 00:18:01,990
for two you know the live resin process

424
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,490
I'll just you know because because of

425
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,690
the way everything gets clogged and

426
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,159
everything like that I just would never

427
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:13,450
recommend doing it fresh frozen ice

428
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,490
water instead alright so if I do it

429
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,259
through like a sweet leaf am I still

430
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,500
making live resin is it gonna come out

431
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,500
the same

432
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:36,669
you know what machine you just gotta

433
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,190
compensate for to try to get the end

434
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,720
product that you're looking for you know

435
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:46,870
if the machine operates a little bit

436
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:49,960
differently just try to compensate make

437
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:53,829
you know it's a process you know I don't

438
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,569
really think you know live resin is what

439
00:18:53,829 --> 00:19:01,240
do you guys prefers where's like type of

440
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:03,220
now grown here fresh dried yes there's

441
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,048
certain strains that come out amazing as

442
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,470
live resin that you know really tastes

443
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:12,908
awesome but I think those are looks like

444
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:15,220
the tangi tan geez yeah all those ones

445
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,720
taste amazing I was live resin but all

446
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,269
of those taste amazing

447
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,630
dry I think the main reason why people

448
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:24,069
like live resin so much is because the

449
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,990
color yeah totally

450
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:30,490
coming brings out a lot of flavor but

451
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:34,769
certain types of certain flavors get get

452
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,769
muted down by like this kind of watery

453
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,250
but certain strains in live resin the

454
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:43,500
Terps are amplified and other strains I

455
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,140
feel like it yeah others I feel like it

456
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,700
takes like a nice like dry and cure to

457
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:56,640
really bring out the chirps - they're

458
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:59,100
like maximum true aesthetically pleasing

459
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,130
as if it's cut down early frozen and

460
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:06,298
extracted true in the form you know it's

461
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,710
gonna look yellow yeah so yeah I've

462
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:09,329
learned to take the plants a little bit

463
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,409
early if I know they're gonna be oil the

464
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:13,379
actor looks so much better

465
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:16,020
it's definitely a definitely a tactic

466
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,270
that a lot of growers use all right

467
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,710
these days I just want to go around the

468
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:22,230
room what's your favorite train to smoke

469
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,519
as a flower and favorite to dab that's

470
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,490
funny I was just talking to Chris about

471
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,500
this my favorite was always the SF vog

472
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,829
and I haven't had it in quite some time

473
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,808
but uh that's my that's the ultimate in

474
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,470
flower and dad from the San Fernando

475
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:36,990
Valley

476
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,519
Oh G cush it's gonna I'm gonna if I ask

477
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,620
a lot of people if I asked 100 people I

478
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,058
bet 50 of them would say the SF vog it's

479
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:48,359
awesome and probably 40 of them didn't

480
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:51,678
smoke the real one Oh Chris is speaking

481
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,288
about it already you want us to skip you

482
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,240
all right Brian favorite strains I

483
00:20:54,288 --> 00:21:02,009
really like smoking Jack Herer flower

484
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:13,589
okay and really any any African sativa

485
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:17,038
just love okay I think it's 10 lean is

486
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:19,619
the common terpene there's I really like

487
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:25,919
those get up and do things during your

488
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:28,109
day when it's done right it's done it

489
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,559
can be done so well I want to assume

490
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,709
that Turpin alene is a terpenoid it is

491
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,509
correct

492
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,759
Chris I want to hear about one of the

493
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:42,609
isomers of Terp Terp anine I can't

494
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,719
remember ed believe it's gamma and

495
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:47,538
[Music]

496
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:50,179
has a very distinct smell and is

497
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:52,190
attributed to like the jack and XJ type

498
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:53,989
smells and a lot of times can be a very

499
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,330
like overpowering note in like a lemon

500
00:21:53,989 --> 00:22:00,440
haze or silver haze or something like

501
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:07,878
that very fairly common in like

502
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:08,960
hybridized definitely yeah Dutch treat

503
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:11,388
in there as well

504
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,399
you can really that's I think like if

505
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:14,538
you're gonna get into turbans that's

506
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:25,008
when you're gonna be able to pick up

507
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:36,460
more than a little different okay what's

508
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:39,139
your favorite stream yeah

509
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:43,308
and is that flower that's gonna flour

510
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:46,788
and lemon strain we got that we call

511
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:48,019
Lemongrab and we got apparently you know

512
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:52,249
just passed down through a number of

513
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:54,079
people through arm farms up in Seattle

514
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:56,149
and it was apparently some 20 year old

515
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,308
lemon from soma and it is just a killer

516
00:22:56,148 --> 00:23:01,728
strain it just makes this like just

517
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:04,069
intense lemon and has no no no lean

518
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:06,200
taste and it's a lot different than you

519
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:07,878
know the common lemons I think we talked

520
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:25,879
about yesterday a much different than

521
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:30,759
that yeah lemon strain we had a nice

522
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:43,488

538
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:49,940
a unique thing yeah if there's no

539
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:52,509
cookies distinct break it up and you get

540
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,110
a little something different you know

541
00:24:52,509 --> 00:25:05,299
you guys compared the number fours with

542
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:07,459
s ones we got from the Prophet out in

543
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,509
California we have not popped those just

544
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,190
yet now that we've got this new

545
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,529
warehouse far enough I think we're gonna

546
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:21,740
check them out and we have the cut of

547
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:23,149
the GG for so I've grown a ton of GG for

548
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,589
so I'll be able to recognize it a little

549
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,940
bit so we were talking about the

550
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,649
granddaddy purple and I said it's not my

551
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,269
favorite I'm gonna kind of diss your

552
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,440
strain here but then I've got the two

553
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:32,089
guys in the room that are gonna be able

554
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,460
to explain to me why I don't like it

555
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:36,470
when I smoke granddaddy purp snow matter

556
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,450
and it's a lot of purple buds do this to

557
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,759
me when they're dried and cured they

558
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,110
taste like they are still wet is that

559
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,759
have you experienced adders that make

560
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,289
sense to you that it's taste like

561
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,970
there's moisture in the bud or I don't

562
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:53,409
like the flavor of granddaddy perps the

563
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:56,240
moisture content shouldn't be affected

564
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,340
directly I don't think it's actually

565
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,339
moisture it just tastes like wetness or

566
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,250
perps and my floral these are just

567
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:08,379
different sort of like floral top notes

568
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,180
terpenoids things that are like a little

569
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,890
bit less like elucidated I would think

570
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,600
you like the Cannabis sort of spectrum

571
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,660
relative to like the symbol turban so

572
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,169
you've got like a situation where like

573
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,970
how they age and how they oxidize is

574
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,890
kind of dependent so you may get that

575
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:29,200
effect but some people might identify

576
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:30,820
that physical frog [ __ ] every time even

577
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,279
when it's dried and cured properly you

578
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:38,109
know Grandaddy perps a fickle fickle

579
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:41,769
lady you know what I mean the purple

580
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:44,500
Oracle there's different fee knows and

581
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:46,089
cuts I feel like there's definitely one

582
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,619
that's like a little bit heavier I'm

583
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:51,849
like the cardboard which may be kind of

584
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,889
what you're talking about a little bit

585
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:57,359
it kind of swell you know it kind of

586
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,360
smells like maybe it was cured in a way

587
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,880
that being said though I don't know

588
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:09,299
where you're getting a lot of your GDP

589
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,100
from but what I said true dat but yeah

590
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,299
GDP you were growing or was this GD you

591
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,139
know I've never grown it because I'm not

592
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:19,389
if I've never been a fan GDP was hugely

593
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,970
mass produced rain out of California for

594
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:30,400
quite some period of time and was one of

595
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:32,259
the you know massive commercial-style

596
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:46,810
grow warehouses where they're sending it

597
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:55,509

the butthole song is there such a thing

652
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:27,649
as the butthole song that happens

653
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:29,659
between you two what would it take to

654
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,398
get you boys to riff a little bit of the

655
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:40,519
butthole riff here on the show for me I

656
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:41,989
think you would probably take those we

657
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,819
might have to pause real quick and come

658
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,179
back once we get the whole yeah that's

659
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:46,178
not gonna happen

660
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,719
whole riff and we'll see if we can tempt

661
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:53,298
this young man to sing some butthole

662
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,569

your life is less important than the Sun

have you ever seen a cute little

670
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:19,099
butthole

671
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:27,490
it's highly inappropriate that you just

672
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:33,849
wanted to maybe paint a picture of it

673
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:37,349
and maybe do some other things as well

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,558
of butthole

679
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:11,878
it tastes so good it tastes so sweet

680
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:17,418
tastes kind of like a coconut meat hey

681
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:22,378
Jeff when was the last time you ate but

682
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:25,989
more recently than I care to admit its

683
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:29,819
what a lucky guy

684
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:39,029
to have those bottled Terps for dinner

685
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:39,030
every night I'm sure she won't fight

done cause it's so damn clean making but

689
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:00,399
is serene

00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,110
if I don't like it for a while I get

691
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,378

yeah here first the butthole song segue

711
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:45,610
into a little bit of a movie I haven't

712
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:49,839
heard that performed in at least as long

713
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:55,710
as he's been a part I heard Jimmy played

714
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:58,900
that back [ __ ] Jimmy [ __ ] kills it

715

man yeah he's better than tre way better

716
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,309
man all right so we've got we've gone a

717
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,630
long time and I want to reward my

718
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:05,949
listeners everyone that's made it

719
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,990
through the butthole song that's made it

720
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:09,909
all the shenanigans let's talk about

721
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:11,619
hash we've got some amazing hash artists

722
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:13,269
here in the in the room everyone's nice

723
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:16,119
relaxed are all comfortable we're all

724
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:17,739
friends now what's coming up with hash

725
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,369
what's gonna be next we've got clear

726
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:22,209
Hersh

727
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:23,889
we've got dissolvable dr. pepper Terps

728
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,780
that's the truth everyone's talking

729
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:27,369
Terps everyone talks Terps they don't

730
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,660
even know it herbs means yeah most

731
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,400
people don't know what a team flavor

732
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:31,889
gonna call the flavor components and the

733
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,369
flavor is

734
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:38,199
terpenes and flavours turps and I think

735
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:40,630
you know got some people out there doing

736
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:43,419
some little terpene isolettes stuff like

737
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,980
that but I think the game's gonna be you

738
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,869
know sort of just keeping the essence of

739
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,490
cannabis so that everyone can experience

740
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:50,319
it and all the different formulations

741
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,849
you know it's like a kind of more of an

742
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,490
art and cannabinoids they're a little

743
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,679
bit more stable and flavors are kind of

744
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:58,449
like our you know perfumers and people

745
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,899
who do that sort of extraction but you

746
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:05,559
know doing it for their own methods and

747
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,329
I think cannabis hasn't quite matured to

748
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,699
that level of science and it's kind of

749
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,639
getting there just now been given the

750
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,239
freedom we were a little we were

751
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,039
prohibited from doing that

752
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,299
experimentation all right so you feel

753
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,630
like Terps are next do you look like you

754
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:24,880
got something important to say good me

755
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:26,289
we definitely have not been okay and so

756
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,470
some people have been doing some

757
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:33,820
research on unter beans for a while I

758
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:36,509
mean aromatherapy that's a lot of people

759
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,510
on that but it's

760
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,030
that's real because it's one of the

761
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:46,639
things that gets us I the way that we

762
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:49,849
want to use it for people using lavender

763
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:52,068
oil and stuff like that just in there is

764
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:56,000
it bedside steamers and stuff like that

765
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:57,920
or whatever the essential essence so if

766
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,300
I mean it's definitely real and so

767
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,849
incorporating that in the cannabis is

768
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,289
pretty cool yeah keeping keeping that

769
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,730
original essence and so coming up with

770
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:09,050
the different extractions and trying to

771
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,579
get just the terpenes and then get

772
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,609
plants that produce a lot of terpenes

773
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:15,170
and there's there's pretty neat

774
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:17,480
information out there in theories on how

775
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,909
you can influence the terpene levels by

776
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,789
soil management and like environmental

777
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:24,139
controls and stuff like that you know

778
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:25,880
this isn't the only industry where

779
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:30,889
turbines are prevalent or where people

780
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:39,230
want the turbines from what they're

781
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:43,608
about different things they want to be

782
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:59,240
able to extract those these other

783
00:39:43,608 --> 00:40:01,400
industries and follow their lead you

784
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,379
said that environmental factors play a

785
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,630
lot into my terpenoids and my soil I

786
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,950
know you're not you're more on the hash

787
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,780
side than you are the grow game from

788
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:11,358
what I understand about you could you

789
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,490
give myself and my listeners one hint on

790
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,929
how we could improve our Terps in our

791
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:17,059
garden one thing that we could just stop

792
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:25,848
doing or start doing that would correct

793
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:26,960
our Terps I've got that all right sounds

794
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,599
good to me you guys you heard it here

795
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,849
he's gonna read that and find it look

796
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,550
like you got some to say Jordan rosin

797
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:36,190
breath slowly rosin bro Triple Threat a

798
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,230
lot of my friends listen to this podcast

799
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,450
I've tasted one person's rosin that I

800
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,550
liked everything else tastes like burnt

801
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:45,828
popcorn I get a lot of the burnt popcorn

802
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,119
yeah I had one guy my buddy Tim came

803
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:48,740
through and he had some properly made

804
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,970
rosin I think he made it himself he was

805
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:52,969
the only one who had rosin

806
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:59,719
I liked about that low temp high

807
00:40:52,969 --> 00:41:01,159
pressure rosin from salt you don't want

808
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:06,559
that [ __ ] you don't want the cuticle

809
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:09,289
waxes all the stuff even if you did like

810
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,349
half a fish and rice if for any kind of

811
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:13,730
gets you away from that bulk of the

812
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:16,519
plant material and that's going to

813
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:19,490
increase your resin quality you're gonna

814
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,800
get a lot less of the the resin stuff in

815
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:22,909
the plant material and overall just

816
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,530
gonna be more of a pleasant experience

817
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:28,339
just kind of come up with a reasonable

818
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:30,500
sipped dry I sift or you know if you can

819
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,050
keep the moisture away you know people

820
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,940
are building out cold rooms doing do go

821
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,530
in the fold the full-length and so if

822
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,470
you can break that material down get

823
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:41,810
away from all that leaf there it is okay

824
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:43,459
so oh man that's a lot of work for a

825
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,869
home grower sometimes what's your what's

826
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,670
the most recommended way of getting some

827
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,640
dry sift out of that to work it into

828
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,289
rosin I mean I think you can just kind

829
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,139
of promptly break down

830
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:56,630
you know they got wrote at Machine okay

831
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:58,159
they've got ways of sniffing material

832
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:02,390
that can that are pretty efficient if

833
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:06,049
you just can I rosin my Keefe yes oh

834
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:07,730
yeah I see a bunch of head not come out

835
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,050
it tastes like burnt popcorn or since we

836
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,740
didn't use plant matter did it taste

837
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,900
right I mean it definitely tastes better

838
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,969
than what comes out of the flower you

839
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,970
know she didn't [ __ ] out as a classic

840
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:24,259
and always when it comes to any process

841
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:33,199
true that if it's key for not like

842
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:35,480
bubble like oxidation and plants been

843
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,309
through what should I be doing with my

844
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,559
reclaim I've got a drop down that's

845
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:53,059
probably got thrown it away just throw

846
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:54,829
it away CBN okay make sleepy time

847
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:56,539
sleepy time CBN heat it up make it in

848
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,420
and then just dab it again or be edibles

849
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:01,269
with it

850
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,099
it alright dabbing it'll have very

851
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:05,349
little psycho activity but you probably

852
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,910
find a calming sleepytime effect from it

853
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,349
we've got I've got a video going they

854
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:11,889
said can we season our nails with

855
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:14,859
reclaim yeah yeah why couldn't you bro

856
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:16,420
yeah you totally could buddy if you're

857
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,219
kind of like upset with your buddy you

858
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,180
know take some of his like oil and just

859
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:29,379
kind of use cleaning it brings the flame

860
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:34,328
in one thing one thing I've seen

861
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:36,309
recently I saw a picture on the internet

862
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:39,010
the other day of someone who had smashed

863
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:45,069
their fingers it was a girl because

864
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:47,799
there's girl fingers super you know low

865
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:50,108
temp high pressure situations and didn't

866
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:53,559
get their fingers out of the way and it

867
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:56,078
was not a pretty sight it looks like you

868
00:43:53,559 --> 00:44:03,369
ran over a banana yeah yeah it was

869
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:04,568
terrible yeah most of you guys are you

870
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:05,650
stole your girlfriend's hair

871
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:07,509
straightener they're not using a

872
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:17,260
hydraulic press or anything be fair that

873
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:19,450
as goofy and stupid as it works actually

874
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,369
flower and a hair straightener is the

875
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:26,379
first time we tried it what was that

876
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:27,940
from the gorilla glue I remember I don't

877
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,410
remember your rosin virginity

878
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,760
unfortunately I think we're gonna run

879
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:33,399
into just like any of these other

880
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,380
extracts is that with some plants will

881
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,420
be better suited for PHS absolutely for

882
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,338
rosin you get certain heats intention

883
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,530
with certain turbines no bueno and

884
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:47,440
certain ones are fine so I think it's a

885
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:49,450
matter of like where do these if it's

886
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,068
all going towards oil then there's five

887
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:52,838
or six ways to make oil and that's gonna

888
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:55,869
leave different spectrums of which

889
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:58,088
plants get turn in the GDP maybe he gets

890
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:59,829
pressed and doesn't taste like so right

891
00:44:58,088 --> 00:45:01,539
so whatever or maybe it's like you

892
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:05,380
really taste better when you get it

893
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:07,269
first I like the way you think my friend

894
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,338
yeah we got to get some Jesus key and

895
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:10,568
press it and then blast it and then make

896
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:12,250
bubble out of it and see if we can

897
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:14,409
convince me that I like that flavor

898
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,449

899
