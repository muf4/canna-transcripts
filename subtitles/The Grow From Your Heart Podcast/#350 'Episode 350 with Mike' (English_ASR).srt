joining us ladies and gentlemen I know

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,599
intro music I keep saying it messes up

8
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:18,210
my rhythm and also it messes up YouTube

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,039
I'm get myself in trouble using music

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,519
bit I am allowed to use on YouTube it

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,720
says use this music it's free like I get

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,858
it from a website that they're all about

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,149
it but then YouTube is like you can't

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,740
use that music it's because somebody

15
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,419
else has probably used that free music

16
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,308
in their video instead of YouTube's just

17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,160
like first-come first-serve [ __ ]

165
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,480
walked in and tried to steal the samurai

166
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,439
sword at a little samurai sword holder

167
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,509
does that make any sense it might have

168
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,399
been a Steven Seagal movie I don't

169
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,550
remember a little boy stealing one but

170
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,649
yeah if you're gonna display samurai

171
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,300
swords this is the little stand for sure

172
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:12,199
yes just yeah so this is a little tiny

173
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,569
it would basically be it's a sword

174
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,120
display stand but it's a tiny version so

175
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,800
imagine if you had or maybe baseball

176
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,180
bats or billiards cues I don't know if

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,980
you put billiard excusing there's a bow

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,900
probably but yeah you don't what you

179
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,150
don't want to use lanlan maybe baseball

180
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,739
bats but anyway this one is tiny it is

181
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,439
tiny it is probably two and a half

182
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,199
inches wide and then it's got three

183
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,509
tiers on it and it's basically a shelf

184
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,969
for your dabbers so that you don't have

185
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,688
to set your sticky dabber on the table

186
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,449
this thing is

187
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:44,669
some it was 3d printed in a 3d printer

188
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,619
it is a sweet baby blue color it's got

189
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:48,269
the davon granny logo right in the

190
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,619
middle here then on the bottom it looks

191
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,959
like it's got the name of the company

192
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:54,689
who printed it it says ee7 10.com

193
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,728
printed in detroit this was gifted to me

194
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,679
by the beautiful davon granny this has

195
00:06:56,728 --> 00:07:01,048
already gotten so much use right in the

196
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:03,078
past I noticed it when I walked in I'm

197
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:05,368
like yeah you don't have to hunt for the

198
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,769
it's got a little spot it's not gonna be

199
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:09,419
on the table getting sticky also along

200
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:13,009
with that a little accessory pack came a

201
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,209
DAB and granny carb cap holder it's uh

202
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,649
I'm gonna say it's a golf tee for your

203
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,418
carb cap that's the easiest way to

204
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,678
explain it your carb cap sits on that it

205
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,938
goes on the Riggin and gets sticky then

206
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:23,518
you set it down right on the table the

207
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,989
table get sticky this basically goes

208
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,329
between the two and it holds the carb

209
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:28,468
cap upright works beautifully I love it

210
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,059

granny once again shout out to della

220
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:51,360
Luna glass it was a good time hanging

221
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:55,819
out those ladies I got all the time

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,968
davin granny gave me some medicated

223
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:02,300
it's cannabis syrup and it's 1000

224
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:05,728
milligrams in this little bottle and

225
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,739
it's uh it's called nano infused and I'm

226
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:09,178
not exactly sure how they nano infuse it

227
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:11,278
they did not write that on the bottle

228
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:12,778
I'm going to research that I was told

229
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:14,488
there are two methods used for nano

230
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:17,728
infusing and one is unhealthy and the

231
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:22,978
other is healthy I did it once and I got

232
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:26,338
lit as dude just a little bit it says to

233
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,808
drink a cap fool I drink a lot fool I

234
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:33,870
would probably drink 3 ounces of that

235
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:35,759
stuff yeah and immediately as the drink

236
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,500
went into my body I could feel it hit my

237
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,860
stomach and then I can feel it spread

238
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,360

239

240
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,860
arms and there it goes through my

241
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,778
fingertips to my brain I was like oh my

242

get slow-motion and melt a little bit I

244
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:55,328

245
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,479

00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:56,740
dabber if you're not a heavy consumer if

273

events and festivals it could have come

280
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:10,240
from Michigan it could have come from

281
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:12,458
Seattle I think could have been from

282
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,769

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,459
onstage doing an event and when she said

289
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,009
so

290
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:32,500
Seattle made up for it and then some

291
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:34,360
town here you go and make it yeah every

292
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,009

00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,930
that happens yep yes we're gonna have

326
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,220
fun here in Colorado let's get back to

327
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,919
what we were smoking on obviously it's

328
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,210
[ __ ] working I've been smoking on the

329
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,589
coffee nectar we've talked about the

330
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,690
coffee nectar several times on the

331
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,100
podcast mics coughing so hard he took

332
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,990
off his headphones you guys if that

333
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,909
tells you anything talked about the

334
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,940
coffee nectar it's the dark roast coffee

335
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:19,309
and watermelon candy flavored just

336
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,680
trying to get further from the mic I

337
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,839
really like this gunslinger nectar this

338
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,209
is star fighter and star dog it's

339
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,850
described as watermelon gummy slices and

340
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:32,480
fresh white ripe watermelon I've

341
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,310
described it as those candies that old

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,779
people have in a candy dish on the table

343
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,169
that are wrapped in a strawberry lookin

344
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,909
wrapper

345
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,139
I think this tastes just like that when

346
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,439
he died but if you wanted a bit I go far

347
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,980
bro

348
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,330
I really like the coffee it was uh

349
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,490
imagine taking a sip of coffee while the

350
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,350
you're at a small space with somebody

351
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,730
over vaping something watermelon

352
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,070
flavored that's a really good

353
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,170
description yep because you you right

354
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,580
off the bat you get a nice light coffee

355
00:12:54,169 --> 00:13:00,919
flavor but almost immediately that

356
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,330
dissolves and it's a light watermelon

357
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,229
candy so it's like being in the car with

358
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:10,160
Brian a little bit coffee and watermelon

359
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,480
Vegas listen to this one day bro and

360
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,819
then Mike was kind enough to bring over

361
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,409
some New York City diesel batter from

362
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,390
apothecary

363
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:19,819
the texture on that is really nice I

364
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,399
like these matters and that flavor it

365
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,410
left up I don't know what turf that is

366
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,629
but that I've been in love everybody

367
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:28,579

368
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,899

371
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,889
smile on my face that's why I brought

372
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,620

373
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:44,019

big milestone I haven't missed a Monday

380
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:01,789
in close to five years if I've done my

381
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:03,169
math one time I got to give you a

382
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,549
shout-out because one time I was

383
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,529
actually sick it was probably this time

384
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:10,849
of the [ __ ] year and I sent you and a

385
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:12,919

387
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:21,199

388
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:25,069
record here so much yep that's pretty

389
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,480
much how I turned these knobs over here

390
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:34,040
that make the podcast happen and hit

391
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:36,590
record but in my book that's a [ __ ]

392
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,980
podcast it came out so yeah I think it's

393
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,230
been close to five years if I did my

394
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,399
math correctly every time you and I try

395
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,769
to figure out how long it's been on

396
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,289
while we're recording the show it gets

397
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,470
ridiculous yeah that somebody out there

398
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,879
will let us know and then if I time it

399
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,470
right bro I don't want to make any

400
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,509
promises I have to record a couple of

401
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,700
bonus episodes and put them out like

402
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,289

404
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:06,559

405
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:08,720
episode 420 on 4/20 bro oh man I don't

406
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,699
know if it'll happen I'm trying we can

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,879
try to make that happen we can try it

408
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,450
but that's that's so MIT that's we're

409
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,450
gonna need coffee

410
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,979
let's move forwards I forgot what the

411
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,440
[ __ ] I was gonna say anyway

412
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,680
maybe we'll do that episode about 420

413
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,860
well do EPS

414
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:38,159
for three seconds worth of about uses

415
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:40,019
[ __ ] content Mike just smacked his head

416
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,850
directly top of the microphone no this

417
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,230
show is for people who are curious about

418
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,278
the current state of cannabis so I

419
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,089
suppose it would be an inappropriate

420
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:52,528
topic but man I've read that [ __ ]

421
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:53,820
[ __ ] post so many times yeah yeah we'll

422
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,049
talk about what it means to us and how

423
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:06,480
we got introduced to it or something

424
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:09,829
right 4:26 Center was back and this is

425
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,830
gonna be a rambling episode you guys

426
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,959
every time Mike is a [ __ ] train wreck

427
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,519
of a podcast and I love it it makes it

428
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:22,649
so much thanks for not saying train

429
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:26,689
wreck of a human life most of your life

430
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,690
that you reveal seems to be pretty

431
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:33,240
skeleton curious gotta bear the

432
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:37,399
skeletons deep that's how people don't

433
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,399
find them no no Mike seems to be a

434
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,650
[ __ ] train wreck I'm trying to find

435
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,899
some rails I've got a couple of iTunes

436
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,189
comments I want to read and then since

437
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,419
its episode 350 I feel like it's

438
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,529
appropriate to read iTunes comments I'm

439
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,729
not sure why that felt like appropriate

440
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:55,799
but it is we've got three new comments

441
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,080
two of them are good one of them just

442
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,159
we'll talk about it yeah we finally got

443
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,900
a negative comment you guys which

444
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,189
[ __ ] I've expected it and that's cool

445
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,799
because when you get a negative comment

446
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,420
on iTunes it actually puts you in the

447
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,578
algorithm for your comments to be seen

448
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,929
by other viewers it'll put you up in the

449
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,938
advertising and stuff and it allows more

450
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,679
people to leave reviews because now it

451
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,600
believes that not all of my 5 star

452
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
reviews are Russian trolls or some sort

453
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,789
of bots or something it's like oh look

454
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,259
somebody actually cousin Steve exactly

455
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,088
he just went made a hundred and fifty

456
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,709
email accounts it made reviews under all

457
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:27,000
of those but no now they believe it

458
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,590
because somebody gave a bad review and

459
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,549
if I was trolling myself I wouldn't put

460
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,349
a bad review in there so now they

461
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,269
believe it's real so I've seen it pop up

462
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,549
in more places which is cool let's get

463
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,558
to the first to positive reviews this

464
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,259
one was left on August 29th

465
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,730
um this person I'm trying to read their

466
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,000
name oh and I just hit the wrong

467
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,940
but an iPad their name is Oh H si n 666

468
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,048
maybe it's Ohio's n 666 I'm done with

469
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
wherever you're from and whoever you are

470
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:53,009
thanks for the great review because it

471
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,290
goes like this great podcast probably

472
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,849
one of the best out there originally I

473
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,039
was hooked on the Joe Rogan experience

474
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,199
but as soon as I found podcast he

475
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,460
spelled it with a pea pod casts I got

476
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,830
hooked on the growth from your heart

477
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,690
podcast I've been hooked ever since and

478
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:09,418
I listen to it daily I've learned a lot

479
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,340
and I've been reminded of a lot of stuff

480
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,540
I had forgotten that's great because I

481
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,699
like to go back and remind you of the

482
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,470
stuff that we forget because we get so

483
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,940
advanced that you forget you become a

484
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,069
black belt you forget that white belt

485
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,210

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,210

be awesome so I hope that you guys have

574
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,750
noticed I kind of went back into the

575
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,369
drying and curing again because I'm

576
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,019
trying to get back to the basics while

577
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:32,939
also teaching the advanced techniques I

578
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,190
did drying and curing I did harvesting

579
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,450
excuse me then I also did carbohydrates

580
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,640
and enzymes you know which are a little

581
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,319
more advanced learning I liked the redo

582
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,570
of some of those old episodes was like

583
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,039
specifically with dragon carrying we've

584
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,349
learned more about environments that

585
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,970
aren't ours since that first killer

586
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:50,609
drying cure episode have probably been

587
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,579
through three large-scale growth and a

588
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:55,229
hundred medium scale grows and 27 small

589
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,759
grow since then yeah I'm exaggerating

590
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,829
with twenty thousand but you have been

591
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,450
do a lot of grows big and small because

592
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,369
that first strike here was like what

593
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,110
episode 36 I've told so many people go

594
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,529
find it I'm

595
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:09,659
72 or something like that yeah we're at

596
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:13,230
350 now we've learned a lot so much

597
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,519
episodes so much oh my goodness yeah and

598
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,589
I'm not afraid to go back and say hey I

599
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,029
was doing it wrong back in the day we

600
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:20,069
were doing it right back in the day and

601

we've learned 10 important things sensei

602
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:23,879

603
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,920

00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:11,640
insulting velcro shoe wearing people the

648
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,220
only female guests I can recall having

649
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,259
in a long time as granny see here's the

650
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,269
thing I just scrolled back

651
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,710
I mean stitches been messing with me a

652
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:26,069
lot so I didn't really want to reference

653
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:29,340
the platform but we're so 300 and I'm

654
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:33,308
99% sure there's not a female guest from

655
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:35,859
309 the wonderful miss davon granny and

656
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:37,509
uh if there were any inappropriate

657
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:38,798
comments made while granny was on ready

658
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:42,519
was probably making them yeah it was

659
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,079
probably yeah and I don't even need to

660
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,399
defend any inappropriate comments that

661
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,028
may have been made when granny was on

662
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:50,918
like it's just a really weird criticism

663
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:53,200
it's like making fun of my dreads like

664
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,480
go ahead now yourself out I don't have

665
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,919
any yeah it's like my dress like her how

666
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,110
can you be inappropriate with female

667
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,509
guests if if I don't have criticized him

668
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,099
for not having enough female guests

669
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,990
that's fair maybe they're talking about

670
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:06,308
the Instagram live feeds they just

671
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,138
dawned on me I don't know if this is

672
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:09,398
even relative to the podcast but we'll

673
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,449
leave this in here maybe they're talking

674
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:12,699
about the Instagram life he thought

675
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,149
Instagram live feeds we do uh we do joke

676
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,700
a lot

677
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:18,369
and maybe since some of my friends my

678
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,860
personal friends are in there that do

679
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,239
press the boundaries maybe there is some

680
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:23,819
shenanigans in there that people

681
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,829
wouldn't approve of but that is not a

682
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,629
specific separate platform the commenter

683
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:30,129
would have referenced the platform well

684
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,990
if we read further into the comment will

685
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,028
realize that that may not be accurate

686
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,000
that makes me think that what you just

687
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:38,190
said may not be true so ah I don't

688
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,269
recall an appropriate on the podcast

689
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,220
apologize if I hurt your little feelers

690
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,048
but if it was with granny

691
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,980
that's all in fun so we're having fun I

692
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:46,690
don't think I said anything

693
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,210
inappropriate with a female guest

694
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,429
I had Lindsay I had Shannon from CGC

695
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,590
long times ago I don't really hang out

696
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:56,860
Lindsay anymore Shannon hasn't been on a

697
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:59,379
long time ah maybe it was when Angela

698
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:02,528
was here I was like a hundred episodes

699
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,740
ago but or more yeah I don't even know

700
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:06,788
what number that was I we're putting way

701
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,028
too much [ __ ] thought into that

702
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:13,000
moving forward if somebody had little

703
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:14,470
feelers hurt I apologize but uh making

704
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,759
fun of velcro shoe wearing guess I'm

705
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,710
really thinking that this is somebody

706
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,480
watching the Instagram live feeds which

707
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,250
are not the podcast but still if you're

708
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,319
bothered by something I'm saying that's

709
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,819
cool ah there's another podcast you can

710
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,678
listen to check out the dude grow show

711
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,730
it's also free they're probably still

712
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,690
listening to the show so they're gonna

713
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,149
hear this review but anyway

714
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,288
inappropriate guess or inappropriate

715
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:33,908
with the guests not too worried about

716
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:35,408
that nobody else complained they're the

717
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,059
only one saying anything about it the

718
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:38,349
velcro shoe part don't recall but if you

719
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:40,329
want to point it out go for it I'll

720
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:43,358
listen then he said the podcast has also

721
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:45,218
not been reliable lately you can't hear

722
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:47,288
half the podcast sometimes even though

723
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:49,450
he always talks about how he found the

724
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:50,319
issue and fixed it now see that's what

725
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,139
makes me think that there are

726
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:56,829
complaining about the wrong platform

727
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:58,838
because the issue is on stitcher that

728
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,368
issue is definitely a stitcher issue and

729
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:02,950
this is most definitely an iTunes

730
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:05,678
comment yeah that issue is happening on

731
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,629
stitcher and he's talking about multiple

732
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,239
platforms yeah yeah and this comments

733
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:11,618
happening here on iTunes and there's

734
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:13,088
obviously not a problem on iTunes

735
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:14,168
because nobody else on iTunes has said

736
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:15,338
hey there's not a problem and I actually

737
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:17,139
go back and listen away own show on

738
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:19,269
iTunes occasionally just to make sure I

739
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:20,829
can listen to my own show on stitcher as

740
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,569
well because it the problem doesn't

741
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:24,278
happen for me which is why I didn't know

742
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:26,348
about it happens to people with Android

743
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,429
devices so I have no way of knowing if

744
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,960
it's happening or not I have to call

745
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,489
Mike or get a message from somebody else

746
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,489
and they say stitcher phone soon as I

747
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:35,829
notice it cuz I'm an Android stitcher

748
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:40,058
user so I was shoot him a text as soon

749
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:41,439
as I noticed but but he says I talked

750
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,418
about how I found the issue and fixed it

751
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,849
and he says I'm disappointed in you Jeff

752
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:49,509
like I said used to be great so this

753
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:52,989
person's disappointed in me um I'll be

754
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:55,210
okay I'm doing alright but let's address

755
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:57,879
this stitcher issue I've been working

756
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,200
with text from stitcher I've Richard and

757
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:01,178
somebody else I think are their names

758
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,489
I'm emailing with two guys I'm not

759
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,798
calling them out we can't figure it out

760
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:07,179
it happened when happened to three

761
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,829
episodes into after having the new

762
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,969
MacBook is when the issues started so

763
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:12,668
we're wondering if there's something

764
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:14,048
with the conversion here but then we

765
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:16,210
corrected that I did all of the things

766
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:18,908
that they asked I uploaded a new file it

767
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,588
worked the next time the same exact

768
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,119
thing it's hit-and-miss it didn't work

769
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:23,648
it's not something that's happening

770
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,908
there scrolling through my there

771
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:26,378
listening to my episodes and like

772
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,879
looking at my files and [ __ ] to see

773
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:30,699
what's going on neither one of us can

774
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:32,019
find an issue ah I've got the stitcher

775
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,219
team working on it the people that made

776
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,569
stitcher the people that built that

777
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:36,669
machine they don't know why it's [ __ ]

778
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:39,968
up so if they can't figure it out I know

779
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:41,739
I can't write I know it's not an issue

780
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:43,838
with what you're uploading because it

781
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,590
uploads smooth smoothly to other

782
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,210
platforms

783
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,308
every other platform it works it's just

784
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,528
stitcher that's havin issues it all goes

785
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:52,418
to the same RSS feed honestly I loaded

786
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,470
up one time and it goes to like

787
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:57,190
Feedburner

788
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,259
cast box iTunes stitcher wherever else

789
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,850
it goes it goes through the one RSS feed

790
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,259
that's how an RSS feed works you just go

791
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:03,459
to a place you register your RSS feed

792
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:05,499
and every time you put something else in

793
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,419
it that place picks it up and puts it

794
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:08,829
into your device somehow it or not all

795
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:10,990
that technology works but you just have

796
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:12,278
one RSS feed other than YouTube YouTube

797
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,558
I have to make a separate video for it

798
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:17,109
because it's a video not audio so it

799
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,628
works on everything but stitcher so if

800
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:21,158
you can't you're obviously found it

801
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:22,449
because you're listening on iTunes so

802
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,769
quit complaining dude you're still

803
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,389
listening to the show you just want to

804
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:29,349
leave a negative [ __ ] review and be a

805
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:30,969
troll America anyway he said like I said

806
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,778
it used to be great don't worry bro if

807
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,460
you're not happy with what you're

808
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:35,759

should I think we should it was very

873
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:51,398
it's a moral imperative serious on me

874
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:54,278
you're gonna need to take a DAB just

875
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:58,858

882
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:14,739
super informative episodes this is one

883
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:17,409
of the more education and conversation

884
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:19,088
sort of episodes mike's nodding his head

885
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:23,739
that doesn't work on a podcast well i

886
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:27,038
know put some rocks in your mouth a

887
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:29,919
while back a few people have asked me

888
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,419
not a while back over time several

889
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,839
people have asked me what my favorite

890
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:35,919
strain is and being a breeder and having

891
00:32:34,838 --> 00:32:38,558
grown for so long

892
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,629
selecting one strain to be my favourite

893
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:45,509
is like asking mike to pick which of his

894
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:45,509
two kids is his favorite oh he knows

895

wanna see you guys but I have bread I'm

897
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:02,619
not trying to I don't want to boast this

898
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:04,538
isn't a brightful thing I have worked

899
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:05,888
with and it's easiest to keep track of

900
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:09,249
how many strains I've read by thinking

901
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:11,048
of the males I have used I used grateful

902
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:11,690
dog for commercial production I use the

903
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:13,278
King Kim

904
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,750
stopper Oh Gmail for commercial

905
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,548
production I used the Daybreaker mail

906
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,220
for commercial production I've used the

907
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:20,898
arize mail for commercial production

908
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,730
plus there was a reversed golden goat

909
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,528
that didn't do a lot of projects but it

910
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,778
did make the golden goat feminized seeds

911
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:29,960
and it made the lemon Jeffrey

912
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:32,419
there was a strawberry dizzle project a

913
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,538
long time ago that didn't go anywhere

914
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:37,669
other than a couple of people there was

915
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:43,908
a lemon cush room the lemon cush that I

916
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:46,190
read custom job for that one person yeah

917
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:49,269
yeah it was I never knew the strain that

918
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,919
went into it oh yeah yes because even my

919
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,628
stuff yeah and then those seeds got sent

920
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,519
to somebody in another state and then

921
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:57,109
they got raided with those plants

922
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,669
growing and the DEA said that those were

923
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:00,168
the best plants they've ever seen he's

924
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,399
like this is the most amazing cannabis

925
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:03,740
plants we've ever seen is what the dude

926
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:11,868
told me that the DEA said but I don't

927
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:13,338
know anyway a lot of stuff yeah yeah

928
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:13,730
I've read a lot of stuff is what I'm

929
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:14,898
saying

930
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,358
and so I've got a lot of things to

931
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:18,980
choose from ah the lemon sorbet is

932
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,480
amazing which somebody's taken the name

933
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,068
of it because I never released it I bred

934
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,358
it and I gave a few seeds out to a few

935
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:25,159
friends mind I never really released it

936
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,049
I called it the lemon sorbet it wasn't

937
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,940
official somebody took that name they

938
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,980
put it to market that's cool that one

939
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,260
what I was calling lemon sorbet was the

940
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,990
Grateful dog and lemon Jeffrey that was

941
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,429
[ __ ] tremendous that'll probably never

942
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,719
be released because that's a pain in the

943
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,720
ass to make it doesn't make enough seeds

944
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,098
when you breed with it it made a lot of

945
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,709
great things

946
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:47,450
black cherry Kim scarlet begonias arise

947
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,800
there's a lot of great stuff to choose

948
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:53,358
from Kabletown Kalonji Burning Spear the

949
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,919
one that I called coffee cake for a

950
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,348
while that nobody got to see which is

951
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,699
day breaker and forum cookies like there

952
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:59,838
was a lot of private stuff that stayed

953
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,789
around here that didn't go anywhere

954
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,949
there was some CEM crosses that didn't

955
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:05,809
go anywhere there were a bunch of

956
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,568
grateful dog crosses that we just got to

957
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:10,099
try and house there are there's chem

958
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:12,679
floor to arise that's never been grown

959
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,818
I've got chem for to arise that has

960
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:17,328
never even happened

961
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:21,409
yeah so what am i pointing a favorites a

962
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:23,210
[ __ ] pick a favorite at all of those

963
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:25,699
that's what your favorite Wednesday

964
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,710
yeah so hard I know

965
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:29,179
down to three favorites just because I

966
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,338
kind of put him into categories and I

967
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:32,838
chose three that I bred just because it

968
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,608
made it a little easier for me if I want

969
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:36,710
to step out and mention something of

970
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:38,598
other breeders of stuff that I did not

971
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,659
breed I would have to go with DNA

972
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,869
genetics is Holy Grail cush a lot of the

973
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:46,819
DNA genetics cush is I love all of those

974
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:49,579
I know a lot of people are haters but

975
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,869
back in the day I had a clone or I grew

976
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:53,750
from seed

977
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:56,838
I had a plant of vortex that was [ __ ]

978
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:00,679
awesome there are several other breeders

979
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:02,269
that put out great stuff I had a some

980
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:07,190
Callie connection stuff that was [ __ ]

981
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:09,440
rad that's our og but anyway so the Holy

982
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,789
Grail cush the sour OG and that vortex a

983
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,039
long time ago are probably some of the

984
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:14,389
best that I've grown on the p90 one is

985
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,358
some of the best food I've ever smoked

986
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:19,190
but anyway my three favorites that I

987
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,429
have bread I keep building up the hype

988
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:24,050
just good I'm gonna go with the Grateful

989
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:25,489
dog and we'll talk about the Grateful

990
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,599
dog for a minute Mike I should ask you

991
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:30,979
your three favorites first that would

992
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,359
have been more fair I know so let's talk

993
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,559
about your three favorites this is I'm

994
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,519
just building it up even better and

995
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,809
better and better so let's talk about

996
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,159
your three favorites and we'll get into

997
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,980
Mike's I've got them written on so the

998
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,940
Grateful dog is definitely on my list

999
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,990
it's just an absolutely phenomenal

1000
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:48,619
stream wonderful stone and it almost

1001
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:52,179
instantly takes my back pain away almost

1002
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:55,550
instantly it's it's wonderful

1003
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:58,549
my original favorite was Sour Diesel ER

1004
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:00,380
in New York City Sour Diesel there's a

1005
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,289
lot of imitations now it's hard to find

1006
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,568
yeah but that one that we used to go

1007
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:07,670
around here you could put in a baggie in

1008
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:09,259
a jar in your backpack in the back of

1009
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,300
the car and the car next to you would go

1010
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,940
bro you have that diesel in there yep

1011
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,800
yeah yeah there are a couple of

1012
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,700
different spots around Colorado where

1013
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,650
you get that I think I still that's what

1014
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:23,539
I still when I say Sour Diesel that's

1015
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,190
what I'm picturing the cut that you're

1016
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:27,619
familiar with around here is also known

1017
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,559
as the gardener diesel and it smells

1018
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,930
amazing if I if you're in an illegal

1019
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,699
area that is not the strain to grow nope

1020
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:36,169
if you're in an illegal place that is

1021
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:37,639
not the strain to smoke it is

1022
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,010
troublesome

1023
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,779
so we got the Grateful dog which I'm

1024
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,820
gonna talk about why that's a good

1025
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,590
strain the Sour Diesel that original

1026
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,480
sour and I know why you love that one

1027
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,450
when I smoked that one it makes my eyes

1028
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,610
squint and itch and like all kinds of

1029
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:53,929
weird [ __ ] and it makes my body tingle

1030
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,670
it makes me too high

1031
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:57,789
it gets me right in the eyes every time

1032
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:00,650
yeah the ice glint is definitely

1033
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:03,980
dominant in that one and then for number

1034
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,930
three it's it's a tough choice but I

1035
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,389
have to go with something lemony like a

1036
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:11,710
super sour lemon or a super Lemon Haze

1037
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:14,900
okay you've all been lemony stuff yep

1038
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,429
lemon candy flavor I mean even if it's a

1039
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,410
real light back flavor in the herb

1040
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:22,759
that's in my wheelhouse for sure all

1041
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:25,519
right I like that so we got the Grateful

1042
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,630
dog for that pungent miss and the effect

1043
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:32,119
that's our breakfast herb yeah you got

1044
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,990
the sour D which is that face or before

1045
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:35,089
you I know what you mean by that

1046
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:36,500
and then something lemony which is

1047
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,720
probably more for your uplifting

1048
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,710
breakfast tea sort of a thing all right

1049
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,000
what are you smoking when you're trying

1050
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,500
to calm down and chill out it sounds

1051
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,530
like everything you talked about dog

1052
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,150
okay that's end of the day relax calm

1053
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,590
down put your feet up and that's cuz

1054
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,700
it's God will talk about grateful dog

1055
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,309
here in a second it's because it's got

1056
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:54,949
the SSV og it's got San Fernando Valley

1057
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,059
oh gee cush in there I've been doing a

1058
00:38:54,949 --> 00:39:03,710
lot of what is it the Colin og the white

1059

and city or their name or the screen

1061
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,019
name right now but a lot of the heavier

1062
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,420
isn't even okay it seems to be working

1063
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:18,289
some people to know G to it I've got

1064
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,809
some Kim D I 95 flowers and they seem to

1065
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,329
make me like drowsy yeah that's not

1066
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:25,039
productive or some of that as well yeah

1067
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,420
that's good they're good herb even

1068
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,420
though it's not good or forgetting [ __ ]

1069
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,309
thank you I people down the street I

1070
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:38,089
mean the people that own the legal

1071
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:39,440
dispensary down the road yes good work

1072
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,090
guys good work they know who they are

1073
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,710
they're listening yeah I figured they

1074
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:47,150
would be so the reason that I switched

1075
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,409
over to Mike is because I knew that we

1076
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,610
would agree with a grateful dog the

1077
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:50,899
grateful dog is one of my top three

1078
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,260
favorites i bred the grateful dog that

1079
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,800
is

1080
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:58,930
ah so the Grateful dog is the it's sfv

1081
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,269
its chem 91 the skunk V a cut cross to

1082
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:05,358
San Fernando Valley og cush f4 to make

1083
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:08,780
deadhead OG I selected my favorite cut

1084
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,730
out of that that was number nine that

1085
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,910
one got reversed and made seeds out of

1086
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:17,059
are we gonna say the pheno huh for this

1087
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,949
is one of my most enjoyable projects I

1088
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:21,019
ever done with Jeff that wasn't through

1089
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:23,858
I mean there were like 20 different jars

1090
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:26,780
he set up there a bunch of us that got

1091
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:29,449
if you ever did like water cuddle colors

1092
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,519
in like third grade you get these little

1093
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:33,319
plastic cups of paint and you popped a

1094
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,108
little plastic lid off each one we got

1095
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,880
those with like a quarter gram of every

1096
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:40,039
different strain and then you got a

1097
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,079
narrow it down from there then we all

1098
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,769
got together with our own selection

1099
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,608
lists

1100
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:49,730
went through each one again like we were

1101
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:52,549
incredibly thorough that was so much fun

1102
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:55,760
as so many of those were good and then

1103
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:58,160
going back after I made the s1 seeds to

1104
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,830
go find more of those it was even more

1105
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,799
fun it's just it was like a year and a

1106
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:06,170
half worth of work picking just the

1107
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,150
winners out of that first run yeah yeah

1108
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,619
well because Kevin was involved pops was

1109
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,660
involved you were involved there were a

1110
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:14,329
lot of yeah at least a half dozen of us

1111
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:15,829
guests and fee knows and yep testing all

1112
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:18,099
the difference which one do you like the

1113
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:18,099
best

1114
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:24,109
yeah that was the fun part yeah I was

1115
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:29,089
gonna talk about what they all got named

1116
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:32,869
but it was number nine was solved which

1117
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,789
made see this is where the brain injury

1118
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,309
messes with me but I don't remember if I

1119
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:39,320
called that one GD 77 or just GD because

1120
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:40,699
there was a GD 77 and a GD now they've

1121
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,410
all just become the Grateful dog because

1122
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:44,239
if there's only one left in there

1123
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:46,849
they've all been cold other than the

1124
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,759
keeper so there was number nine was

1125
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:51,469
self-tan it made the grateful dog 77 and

1126
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,940
then no it made the grateful dog because

1127
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:55,730
I didn't need the number 77 on the end

1128
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,070
of it yet to identify anything so I took

1129
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,740
number nine I self dit and that made the

1130
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,200
grateful dog and I took the pollen from

1131
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:05,058
number nine and I put that on the

1132
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,949
grateful dog and that's what

1133
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,319
77 and that's the one I'm working with

1134
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:11,509
now and nobody's not a lot of people

1135
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,670
have heard the 77 part but when there

1136
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,150
were 77 is my favorite year of the

1137
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:19,880
Grateful Dead there were 72 77 few other

1138
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,380
years or that's that's why it got 77 so

1139
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,309
that's why I do you noted this specific

1140
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:27,318
plant as GD 77 I remember right after we

1141
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,510
finished this project this project

1142
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:32,929
somebody was like it's just the pheno of

1143
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:35,000
deadhead I was like and like two years

1144
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:37,009
worth of a bunch of people's lives and a

1145
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,909
lot of dedication and work that's kind

1146
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:44,559
of why I don't even bring it up

1147
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:47,179
sometimes it's crap I've passed that

1148
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,710
insecure crap I guess I just read a

1149
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,318
[ __ ] negative comment and laughed my

1150
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,150
way through it so I think I'm having fun

1151
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,380

1190
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:12,409

care to tell me it's good weed but

1194

I got something special here like I

1197
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:24,650
already knew but maybe for me but I

1198
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:28,220
didn't know other people are gonna love

1199
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,750

Grateful dog harvests now you've got me

1201
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:35,059
[ __ ] saying yeah because you get home

1202
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,840
and you'd have to shower like head to

1203
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:42,849
toe four times just to get some of the

1204
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,849
smell out of your skin it's like dirty

1205
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:49,099
skunks and yeah it was so disgustingly

1206
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:51,949
good so we'll move forward we've talked

1207
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:52,849
about great one lemon Geoffrey is the

1208
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:55,159
next one on my list

1209
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:57,769
lemon Geoffrey is a cross of a it's

1210
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,420
lemon skunk from greenhouse seeds that

1211
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:00,590
lemon skunk is a fun plant to grow but

1212
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,180
it doesn't we've talked about it on the

1213
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:04,730
show it doesn't put out enough weight it

1214
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:08,419
puts out long skinny buds that smell

1215
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,829
like [ __ ] lemony soft candy and ice

1216
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,619
cream it's so good it's got a really

1217
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,029
sweet candy smell I just don't I'm not a

1218
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:16,869
huge fan of the way it grows so I

1219
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,460
reversed golden goat and I put the

1220
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:21,800
reversed golden goat pollen on the lemon

1221
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:26,059
skunk to make lemon Geoffrey and it

1222
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,650
makes these big beefy arm size bugs huge

1223
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:31,849
buds you can beat someone with them

1224
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:33,619

1227
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,180
so sticky and the hi is exactly what I

1228

1244
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:12,618
opposite of the grateful dog the

1245

grateful dog makes me go and I'm like by

1246
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:15,710
myself once I smoke the grateful dog I

1247
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:17,269
get like you know those things they put

1248
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,338
on horses at parades so the horses can't

1249
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:21,259
see the blinders I get those when I

1250
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:23,509
you're gonna lean in his employees yeah

1251
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,010
he started making the I guess would be

1252
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,450
the hand motion for blinders that

1253
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,040
covering the sides of his eyes and I

1254
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:29,219
leaned into the mic to say blinders when

1255
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:31,079
we finally got it it was yeah

1256
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,579
pick another word but I feel like I got

1257
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,019
those on when I spoke the Grateful dog I

1258
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,519
just get into this little puddle I'm

1259
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:37,710
just like by myself you can't mess with

1260
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,090
me want to write a podcast to write

1261
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,829
music or something that's the stuff to

1262
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,599

1263
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:45,210

1264
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,559
lemon Jeffrey [ __ ] take off the

1265
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,389
sunglasses and want to talk to everybody

1266
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,670
look what's up guys I'm ready to go like

1267
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:52,920
that's like if you were a medical

1268
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:56,130
patient and you needed a boost for work

1269
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,840
maybe in your employment [ __ ] funeral

1270
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,880
waken Baken go to work stone to lemon

1271
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,858
Jeffries the [ __ ] to smoke that's the

1272
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,930
way to say it not gonna disagree

1273
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:05,340
so then we'll move forward to my number

1274
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:06,779
three choice you guys are probably

1275
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,550
wondering why I haven't said this one

1276
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,480
yet it's one of my proudest creations

1277
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:14,340
because it has the potency the flavor it

1278
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,829
grows like a [ __ ] champ it breeds

1279
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,869
like a goddamn soldier and it to the

1280
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:20,759
best of my knowledge for quite a while

1281
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:23,309
if not still it held the record for

1282
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,010
highest THC potency lab test with steep

1283
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:27,960
hill labs uh it was at thirty four point

1284
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,220
eight percent is what I think I read

1285
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,358
correctly I don't want to be wrong but I

1286
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:33,179
think it's thirty four point eight

1287
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:36,630
percent THC a and that is my strain

1288
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:38,819
arise that is a golden goat female that

1289
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,588
was pollinated by a Daybreaker male I've

1290
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,900
done an entire episode about her rise if

1291
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:45,900
you want to hear a lot of details listen

1292
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,000
to the arize episode also go to Leafly

1293
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,619
and leave a review on her rise Leafly

1294
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,119
doesn't have a rise posted yet but if

1295
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,530
enough of us leave a review on the

1296
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,480
product they will post it up there so

1297
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,530
let's get a rise up on Leafly but lemon

1298
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,820
Jeffries already up there the grateful

1299
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,780
dog no need to get it there seeds aren't

1300
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,349
available that would just make people

1301
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,530
hangry

1302
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:03,260
but rise we need to get that up there

1303
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:06,240
butter rises one of my favorites because

1304
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,540
being a breeder I saw two plants that

1305
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,618
were so far apart that I was like ooh

1306
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:12,509
like that's what you kind of look for as

1307
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,829
a breeder what's the point of mixing

1308
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,540
chocolate and chocolate you're gonna get

1309
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:18,989
chocolaty chocolate and that I never

1310
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:20,608
understood that so I took is vanilla

1311
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:21,838
vanilla as I could get which is I'm

1312
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:23,989
gonna say that's the golden go that's

1313
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,789
that tropical it almost tastes like

1314
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:28,469
juicy fruit Dom with a Hawaiian

1315
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:31,019
pineapple sort of a flavor and some

1316
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:32,699
oranges and some citrus and then I cross

1317
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,039
that one too we'll call it the chocolate

1318
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:38,098
version the dark dark chocolate would be

1319
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,199
my day breaker mail which was fede and

1320
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:42,510
fuelie and to smell like dirt and it was

1321
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,899
the exact opposite the golden goat's got

1322
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,490
these

1323
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,680
any leaves and it's tall and skinny and

1324
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:49,318
that Daybreaker had those fat leaves and

1325
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:51,058
grew that cushy stretchy structure and I

1326
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,519
was like that right there is how you

1327
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:55,170
make a nice swirl you know what I mean

1328
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,969
you don't just get dark chocolate or

1329
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,920
just bright white vanilla I'm gonna get

1330
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:00,358
I'm gonna see but I'll be able to mix in

1331
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,710
that chocolate and vanilla mixture right

1332
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:04,318
there and I'm gonna see traits of both

1333
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:06,358
and I nailed it like a rise gave me

1334
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,889
exactly one for ya

1335
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,960
the leaves are the shape I thought they

1336
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:12,000
were gonna be the plants grow the way I

1337
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,829
had totally anticipated the aromas were

1338
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,599
what I expected it was like a chef going

1339
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,890
on if you put in this too much of this

1340
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,869
on this much of this you'll make the

1341
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:23,548
best dye and it came out the best it was

1342
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:25,380
beautiful whatever [ __ ] emerald that

1343
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:28,199
[ __ ] to death and I did a [ __ ] good

1344
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,880
job yeah watch the Food Network in a

1345
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,308
long time what was that one girl it was

1346
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,858
really beautiful I picture her head with

1347
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:42,869
her mom a joke guy with the four arms

1348
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:48,659
just now what plants crave all right you

1349
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:52,260
guys but the the world is becoming

1350
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:54,420
idiocracy it's closed it's closed it's

1351
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,309
sad when I don't don't get me started

1352
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,990
we're gonna do another two hours on why

1353
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:02,640
everything's [ __ ] now let's talk about

1354
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:04,889
cannabis more arise arise yeah it's high

1355
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,328
potency good flavor good aroma it's a

1356
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:08,608
great breeder I breed with Ann arise

1357
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:11,160
mail and everything I've got a very

1358
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:13,679
unique arise mail it took me a lot of

1359
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,000
seeds to find that mail I'm not saying

1360
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,318
that you won't find a good one if you

1361
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,818
try and go for it if you want to breed

1362
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,190
with my stuff I encourage you but the

1363
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:21,750
one I found I went through a lot of

1364
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,548
packs of seeds to find I went through a

1365
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,528
jar of [ __ ] seeds to find this one and

1366
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:27,750
the way I would do it I was red I'd run

1367
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:29,190
ten and I'd be like pull all the girls

1368
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,719
and I probably got five boys like that

1369
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:33,000
boy right there is the stud

1370
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,108
let's run ten more seeds and pull all

1371
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
the girls out

1372
00:50:34,108 --> 00:50:37,949
keep those other five boys gone and I

1373
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,900
got those five boys that one right there

1374
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:41,548
is a stud so now I have to standing next

1375
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,528
to each other and I filled up the tent

1376
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:45,710
until I had the whole tent filled with

1377
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:48,269
people that were running a second time

1378
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,730
yeah check those out and then I was just

1379
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:52,259
no not yet not yet and then finally I

1380
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:54,630
found that one and I was like dude look

1381
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,610
at this [ __ ] does and he had a top his

1382
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,019
top Cola was the whole plank

1383
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,730
it was like six feet long and it was

1384
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:01,110
just all coated in big chunky blood

1385
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,199
sites and I was like that's that's a

1386
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:05,880
breeder mail right there bro so he's

1387
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,659
done some work arise the one I've got

1388
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,840
King Solomon is a stud everything I put

1389
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,369
that pollen on just it wins it becomes a

1390
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,440
great [ __ ] plant it makes great

1391
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,079
progeny and it doesn't dominate too so

1392
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,750
much to where it's all arise it puts it

1393
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:24,299
puts the potency the vigor the growth

1394
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:26,250
and the resistance in there that p.m.

1395
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,450
resistance it puts that in there but

1396
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,340
then you get the flavors and the aromas

1397
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:32,009
from the mom still so it's pretty nice

1398
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,510
great breeders so grateful dog lemon

1399
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:35,220
Geoffrey and arise those are my three

1400
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:38,790
favorites Mike went with the Grateful

1401
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:40,469
dog the Sour Diesel and something lemony

1402
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:42,389
probably super Lemon Haze I think that

1403
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:42,599
maybe because you trimmed a super Lemon

1404
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:45,420
Haze

1405
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:49,170
for so long four more years Associates

1406
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,930
like hundreds of different comfortable

1407
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:54,630
it's like going home but that that

1408
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:56,519
flavor it's it's like a smell from

1409
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:00,269
childhood or something it's just I like

1410
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:01,469
it when it's in my life so scientists

1411
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:04,889
have done research and the most

1412
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:06,329
addictive terpene it's a tobacco company

1413
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,859
cigarette companies have done the

1414
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:09,480
research and the most addictive terpene

1415
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,099
is limonene and that's that lemon flavor

1416
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,809
that's one with there were most our

1417
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:17,299
bodies desire most and we get easily

1418
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:20,610
addicted to that's why I that they call

1419
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,170
some dad kids tree bases because we just

1420
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,940
keep coming back for another dad because

1421
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:27,599
sometimes you just can't do there's a

1422
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,760
jar over here labeled sweeties if you

1423
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,789
want to smell bats fighting the urge to

1424
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,680
take it I don't think it's because I'm

1425
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:38,250
addicted to the hash but it's just so

1426
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,659
wonderful I I've got fifteen jars in

1427
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,099
front of me I think it's hard not to

1428
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,449
fiddle with a little own breast I've got

1429
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,829
a DAB sitting on a dabber here I've been

1430
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:48,569
hoping to get you on a rant long enough

1431
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:50,969
reckon it's just but that sweeties bro

1432
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,990
something about that sweet easy when you

1433
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:54,599
hit it you blow it out and you go

1434
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:55,859
probably go for another dab of that it's

1435
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,069
it's not about getting high or anything

1436
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,720
it's just the flavor of that you can't

1437
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:02,850
people say well if you want that flavor

1438
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,799
just eat that candy it's different

1439
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,480
there's something about that's why

1440
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,310
people vape I kind of get it I don't

1441
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,139
totally get it but I get it because you

1442
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:10,529
just want that sweet ease coating all

1443
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:13,049
over your

1444
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:15,810
you can't get that in a way from eating

1445
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:18,769
it's only maybe vaping and dabbing or

1446
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:18,769
the only way that that's gonna happen

1447
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,170
yeah you gotta add nicotine to the hole

1448
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,940
why people vape thing now like as

1449
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,349
someone who's hooked on nicotine that

1450
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,150
feels powerful it's [ __ ] so when I

1451
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:31,980
smell those guys blowing [ __ ]

1452
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,740
blueberry cupcake clouds how much of

1453
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,219
that has nicotine in it I have no idea

1454
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:39,209
okay

1455
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:40,889
enough so that this is a device to help

1456
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,409
people quit smoking as a primary sales

1457
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:45,659
method I didn't realize that all of them

1458
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:47,699
had nicotine I thought it was that fully

1459
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,989
could be the like this is the little kid

1460
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:51,509
with the incredible seizure disorder

1461
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:53,069
thing that we get with our registry it's

1462
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,380
a smaller percentage of the consuming

1463
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,690
population than you might guess from the

1464
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,250
TV coverage the guys are trying to blow

1465
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,420
a ring through a ring and then dance

1466
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,889
through the middle of it and then blow

1467
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,309
dragon through that do you think there's

1468
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:08,639
nicotine and all of that said probably

1469
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:15,299
no I know that the first and only time I

1470
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:17,789
bought vape juice which Lewis blacks

1471
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,100
rant on soy juice I just kind of went

1472
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:22,139
through the same thing but I saw the

1473
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:23,969
mouth vomit what I bought vape juice

1474
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,849
they had three or four different

1475
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:29,250
potencies of nicotine and my dumb ass

1476
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,480
was like give me the big one cuz like

1477
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,219
the whole point is like I'm trying to

1478
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,039
quit smoking I don't want to have to sit

1479
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:36,569
there and hit this continuously yeah I

1480
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,340
want a puff on it three or four to five

1481
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:43,559
times go back inside for two hours and I

1482
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:46,230
chose poorly it was way too [ __ ] much

1483
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:48,719
oh [ __ ] the closest I've ever been to OD

1484
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,190
on nicotine was twice within that

1485
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,750
week-long period where I was playing

1486
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:55,619
with a baby I think I've heard your

1487
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:58,590
story about that actually vomit yeah I'm

1488
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:00,719
driving over this fairly busy hill on a

1489
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,730
fairly busy street just puffing on this

1490
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,649
little nicotine vape not thinking about

1491
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,409
it and all of a sudden the whole world

1492
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,000
starts to [ __ ] vibrate I'm trying not

1493
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:11,460
to throw up and I'm sweating like mad

1494
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,110
and I'm confused because it feels like

1495
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,670
I'm having an adverse reaction to an

1496
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,130
intoxicant but I'm not consuming

1497
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,840
intoxicants and then you realize yep

1498
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,880
if the truck stopped at the light like

1499
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,559
think about it for a second oh [ __ ] I'm

1500
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,849
puffing on this little vaporizer stick

1501
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:31,509
what

1502
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:33,319
straight up dabbing nicotine that's I

1503
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,340
burped but I'm gonna burp

1504
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,320
let me just burp here I'm gonna move

1505
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:39,769
Mike I'm actually surprised more people

1506
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:43,039
haven't gotten sick from vape fluid

1507
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:44,690
because there's a lot of nicotine linked

1508
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,789
in that little bottle oh yeah I'm sure

1509
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,720
they do they just just pass out and let

1510
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:50,880
it pass or whatever

1511
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,879
[Music]

1512
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:58,579
yeah with when you're taking those big

1513
00:55:55,489 --> 00:56:00,769
clouds and yeah and who knows what where

1514
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:02,599
that stuff's from like China people or

1515
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:08,360
Chinese companies don't care what

1516
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:12,650
they're sending there was a famous

1517
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:15,620
comedian told the story about he was in

1518
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:17,570
China and he discovered what they use

1519
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:19,940
for cooking oil if you go to the street

1520
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:22,039
carts to get your noodle bowl that

1521
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,630
cooking oil they lift up the manhole

1522
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,909
cover and reach into the sewer and pull

1523
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,190
out a ladle of sewer juice sewer water

1524
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:29,629
sewer whatever is passing by and they

1525
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:31,309
pour that into the little pot and that's

1526
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:34,700
what they used to cook up your noodles

1527
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:36,139
in the wok yeah bro yeah so they're

1528
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:37,519
doing that to their own people on the

1529
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:38,779
street that are watching him do it

1530
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,460
imagine what they're [ __ ] sitting to

1531
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,830
you telling you it's a vape juice or CBD

1532
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,059
it's every five years there's another

1533
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:46,369
scandal where they're like this big

1534
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:49,009
product I remember one point it was like

1535
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:52,480
lead paint on kids toys toothpaste for a

1536
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:54,800
while yeah it's dog toys all the time

1537
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,969
take the time to research what you're

1538
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,650
buying you can get it from a reliable

1539
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:59,569
source like it doesn't matter if it's

1540
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,280
weed or water or cell phones

1541
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:03,170
yeah and that's probably why I feel

1542
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,050
weird when I smoke a blunt is I'm

1543
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,099
getting that tobacco hi I'm not together

1544
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,570
that's why sometimes you guys when you

1545
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:10,489
pass me a blunt I'll take one good hit

1546
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,110
off of it and pass it back I smoked with

1547
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:14,239
you we're cool that that's why it'll

1548
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,950
take it again that tobacco high gets to

1549
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,939
me I got it look like four dads just to

1550
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:21,589
get that to go away it it's definitely

1551
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,970
the second drug when you throw it in

1552
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,829
there and I don't know why so many

1553
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:26,599
people pretend like it's not know I I

1554
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:28,099
can see you start fidgeting when it's

1555
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,980
cigarette time like I can see your body

1556
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:33,170
change my brain shifts gears and if you

1557
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,940
don't address it like it's that's a real

1558
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:36,289
addiction that's why I laugh people like

1559
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,990
weed addictive I'm like

1560
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm addicted to a couple of things we

1561
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:42,619
day one of them yeah yeah I'm not saying

1562
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,329
it's not possible to get addicted to

1563
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:46,519
cannabis I'm saying it's really [ __ ]

1564
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:48,679
hard yeah the cigarettes are the devil

1565
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:52,009
though but yeah there's several commonly

1566
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:53,629
sold products like Mountain Dew nicotine

1567
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,820
if you take either of those away from me

1568
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:59,780
I'm gonna [ __ ] you up in like six hours

1569

1570
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,660

1571
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:04,599
two things and Mike's not a little guy

1572
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:08,929

international flights gets scary yeah

1574
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:13,639
I've been teaching the podcast listeners

1575
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,929
that if you're in law in an interaction

1576
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:16,400
though it's much harder to say than it

1577
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:18,139
should have been if you are in an

1578
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,720
interaction with law enforcement and

1579
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:22,969
you're a large male like us just sit

1580
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,889
down like because some little cops

1581
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:26,209
smaller average-sized cops will look at

1582
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:27,379
us like [ __ ] I hope he doesn't do

1583
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,960
anything squirrelly and they're gonna

1584
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,820
act a little skittish so my size your

1585
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,199
size just sit on the curb and cross your

1586
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,289
legs and chill out you'll be okay

1587
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:38,449
they're gonna feel more comfortable I'm

1588
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:44,320
gonna move forward with the show Mike's

1589
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:44,319

1590
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:52,670

committee everybody it's episode 350

1593
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,220
do much bro talk we talked about our

1594
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,470
favorite strains we rambled quite a bit

1595

we had a good time I want to read one

1596
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:05,059
Facebook comment because this was really

1597
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:07,639
cool and I figured was a monumental

1598
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:09,829
moment this guy said hey RJ which is for

1599

new show and I'm always rewarded with

1615
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:42,529
plain sensible advice that follows

1616
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:45,170
Einstein's idiom if you can explain it

1617
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,150
sorry I'm gonna back up if you can't

1618
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:50,059
explain it simply then you do not

1619
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:52,220
understand the subject well enough

1620
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:54,679
for the new generation of growers you

1621

1622

01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:13,940
this guy just sued I'm the next I'm one

1628
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:17,239
of the next Ed's or Jorge's I've never

1629
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,730
thought of the show in those terms but I

1630
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:22,489
don't disagree at all I don't know that

1631
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:26,539
I realized that but that is yeah they

1632
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:28,219
are people are the generation [ __ ] my

1633
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,079
generation the generation after me my

1634
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:32,049
daughter's generation they want their

1635
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,069
information now if it's in a book

1636
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,450
they'll never find it if it's on the

1637
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,370
internet there's a good chance they'll

1638
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:39,619
find it if it's delivered audio while

1639
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:42,139
they're driving they might might get it

1640
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:43,759
there's there's a much more opportune

1641
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,949
chance of them finding that info so

1642
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,930
podcasting is going to be one of the

1643
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:49,939
major learning sources YouTube is gonna

1644
01:00:47,929 --> 01:00:51,889
be one of the major learning sources so

1645
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:54,260
I do agree with that and thank you

1646
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:58,069
that's really cool I hope I hope that

1647
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:59,360
doesn't make me nervous but I do

1648
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,039

1649

say names or point fingers but yeah

1701
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:58,848
there's a lot of yeah that Mike comes

1702
01:02:56,869 --> 01:03:00,349
over and hangs out and does this show he

1703

gets dabbed out he gets to hang out

1704
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:06,289
there's no funding for Mike in this I

1705
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:07,699
apologize that Mike knows it's I you

1706
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:09,549
know it would be really [ __ ] cool if

1707
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:12,199
we both got a paycheck for doing this

1708
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:14,838
but that's not what either of us do it

1709
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:16,938
no I do get some patreon contributions

1710
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:20,389
it's a generous amount of funding every

1711
01:03:16,938 --> 01:03:24,379
month it's not like [ __ ] paycheck

1712
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:26,239
style but it is it's a computer and the

1713
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,528
internet obviously covers the car this

1714
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,588
computer was purchased on a Best Buy

1715
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:32,568
card so appreciate this Mike does not

1716
01:03:30,588 --> 01:03:33,949
smell like someone's foot yes and I buy

1717
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:35,989
these little mic covers and I buy these

1718
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:37,938
bottles of water but the payment goes

1719
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:40,188
this computer payment is covered with

1720
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:41,658
that and the Wi-Fi and the cable

1721
01:03:40,188 --> 01:03:43,938
internet here is super expensive so it

1722
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:45,769
covers that stuff so that is definitely

1723
01:03:43,938 --> 01:03:47,598
noticed that keeps the podcast doesn't

1724
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:50,478
cost me anything to produce so it's

1725
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,859
going to be free for you and as long as

1726
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:53,058
I can keep it free until they do some

1727
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:54,708
weird [ __ ] to the internet to where I

1728
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:56,659
have to pay to podcast or something it's

1729
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:58,818
gonna be free it's that's what I'm

1730
01:03:56,659 --> 01:04:01,009
wanting to do I want I'm here to make

1731
01:03:58,818 --> 01:04:03,168
cannabis better not get rich off of

1732
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:05,239
cannabis I want you guys to grow the

1733

01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:09,019
medicate yourself or your loved ones the

1735
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,699
best that they could be medicated so

times of prohibition when I was doing

1760
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:08,760
this sort of thing and I did quite well

1761
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:10,829
during Prohibition times that's not to

1762
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,400
be but when Prohibition was here things

1763
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:13,679
were different

1764
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,480
we were never hungry I'm not hungry now

1765
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,699
but we were spoiled when Prohibition was

1766
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,500
here uh and they never got myself in

1767
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:21,689
trouble I always I always took care of

1768
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,670
other people in those times too if you

1769
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:25,200
came by and you just didn't have any

1770
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:28,289
funds it could you as I could possibly

1771
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:30,059
[ __ ] get you here's a drink yeah

1772
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,650
there's a sit on my couch play some

1773
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,269
video games it's always been me and get

1774
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:35,130
your stone and feed you that's how we've

1775
01:05:33,269 --> 01:05:36,780
always been so I feel like since I

1776
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,460
didn't get in trouble back in the day

1777
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,410
and I've been blessed enough to be in

1778
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,300
something that I just love like cannabis

1779
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:43,619
is awesome to me I wake up thinking

1780
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,200
about it I'm like what are we gonna grow

1781
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:47,789
today so doing this I feel like this is

1782
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:49,679
my give back for not getting in trouble

1783
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:52,019
and this is my gift back for kind of

1784
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,429
being allowed to do what I love to do if

1785
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:54,690
you love what you do you don't work a

1786
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:56,759
day in your life so come in here and

1787
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,889
doing a podcast sometimes there are some

1788
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,530
evenings when I try to say the word

1789
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:03,599
cannabis and I say cab if [ __ ] 17

1790
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:05,400
times in a row and I want to throw the

1791
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,929
microphone through the [ __ ] computer

1792
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,490
screen but by the end of the night when

1793
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:10,230
I'm done recording it all feels great

1794
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:13,079
I've got me to say I like the Grateful

1795
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,849
Dead earlier yeah yeah when you talk

1796
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,019
about your tongue goes weird sometimes I

1797
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:18,989
think to accept it

1798
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:20,659
there's been times when people have

1799
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:23,339
wanted me to do things I've had to miss

1800
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:25,739
shows and parties and social

1801
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:27,480
interactions I've had to minimize social

1802
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:28,859
interaction times sometimes because

1803
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,429
we're trying to do the podcast and I'm

1804
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,019
okay with that

1805
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:32,868
it is

1806
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:36,920
it's well worth it it's well worth it we

1807
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:39,410
put in about three hours from when I

1808
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,450
show up to when I leave to put together

1809
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:43,818
like a 45-minute hour and ten minutes

1810
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:46,159
show it's different when you're not here

1811
01:06:43,818 --> 01:06:48,949
no it goes much smoother when you're

1812
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,179
solo but like that's not worked for me

1813
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:53,750
it doesn't feel like I put in three

1814
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:55,190
hours City job right like no it's it's

1815
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:57,409
very different when you really enjoy

1816
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,630
what you do and I feel privileged to be

1817
01:06:57,409 --> 01:07:02,509
able to do it you guys see the shade all

1818
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:05,780
the listeners set in feedback and not

1819
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:07,579
hate mail I see these upcoming episodes

1820
