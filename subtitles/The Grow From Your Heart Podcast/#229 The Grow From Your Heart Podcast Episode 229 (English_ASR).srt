evening I hope you are as dabbed out as

22
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:01,750
I am right now I am smoking on some what

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,009
am i smoke and let me grab the labels to

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,769
keep messing this up this is called

25
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,879
screamin tangerines and it is delicious

26
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,170
I've been smoking the screamin

27
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,750
tangerines for the past couple of days

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,849
alright so I got a really nice orange

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,129
candy sort of a flavor and a really nice

30
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:16,989
sativa head buzz every time I open the

31
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:18,969
container it just smells like like an

32
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:20,618
orange candy or orange creamsicle or

33
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,349
something like that really diggin the

34
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:27,189
flavor of the screaming tangerines also

35
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:29,589
I usually prefer candy flavored dabs

36
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,539
like tangi or tangerines or of course

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,100
the lemon Jeffrey or maybe the

38
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,530
strawberry I see I had a couple of weeks

39
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:37,839
ago the Clementine is always delicious

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,159
I prefer that candy flavored sort of dab

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,140
thing and I've also noticed that the

42
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,118
candy flavors are quite often the

43
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,500
sativas they give me that nice head buzz

44
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,500
that I'm looking for so when I go for a

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,409
dab I usually prefer the tangi the

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,700
screamin tangerine lemon Jeffrey

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,469
anything with that candy sort of flavor

48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,140
that's usually my favorite sort of dabs

49
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:58,420
to go for but I was at the dispensary a

50
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,269
few days ago and they had some gorilla

51
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,069
glue live batter and something about the

52
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:06,250
smell of it I'm smelling it right now

53
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:09,039
just really drew me in I prefer my

54
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,959
flowers to be the cushy diesel II kind

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,549
of smell and my dabs of course to be the

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,229
candy but when I smelled this gorilla

57
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,569
glue something to my nose was like dude

58
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,250
buy a gram of that so I got a gram of it

59
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:21,219
and I've been dabbing on it and when I

60
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,719
smoke this I get so high like it just

61
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,250
does something to me it makes me like I

62
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,598
just sit down for a minute I forget what

63
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,789
I'm doing I forget what I was trying to

64
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,889
do this gorilla glue has been [ __ ] me

65
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,689
up so this nice nice change has been a

66
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:33,759
great treat so I'm glad I thought I

67
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,680
smelled that episode a few weeks ago

68
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,489
called follow your nose and I'm glad I

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,719
took my own advice and followed my nose

70
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,230
alright before I get too far to ramble

71
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,180
II let me make one apology last week my

72
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:47,738
episode did not load to stitcher if you

73
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,319
listen to the podcast on stitcher I

74
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,030
apologize I posted the episode it was

75
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,589
there Monday morning on iTunes everybody

76
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,719
listened on iTunes they all saw it on my

77
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,300
website but for some reason stitcher

78
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,669
failed to grab the episode I contacted

79
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,980
stitcher several times they basically

80
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:04,718
ignored my emails usually they were able

81
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,608
to get my show up within 24 hours if

82
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,609
there's an issue this time they just

83
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:10,760
basically ignored me

84
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,650
so on Friday I relaunched the episode I

85
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,269
was able to make it go I blocked it from

86
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,099
iTunes so it's not repeated in iTunes

87
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,050
but if you're listening on like pod bay

88
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,299

89
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,460

me and reply and fix it and I didn't

102

can't you I am going super fast today

127
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,699
let's take a quick second sinner the

128
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,520
self and I would like to read an article

129
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,568
from the westward that talks about

130
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,788
cannabis recalls

131
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,830
all right miss articles from the

132
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:43,538
westward it was written Friday July 28th

133
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:45,699
it was actually published Friday July

134
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:48,009
28th the article is by Thomas Mitchell

135
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,080
and the start of the article there's

136
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,179
just a picture the headline is denver

137
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,128
issues first recall for might infested

138
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:56,228
moldy marijuana now let's get to this

139
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,569
picture there's a picture of a plant a

140
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,918
cannabis plant that is in full bloom I

141
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,360
would guess this is seven or eight weeks

142
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,118
in a flower this plant is close to being

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
harvested and this plant is [ __ ]

144
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:10,419
covered in disgusting spider mites just

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,419
riddled with mites the spider mites have

146
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:15,490
built a teepee on top of this bud there

147
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:17,588
is a web that goes from the top cola of

148
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,959
this bud out to every single leaf and it

149
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:21,639
forms like a circus tent it looks like a

150
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,639
circus tent of spider mites but it's all

151
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,379
just a big web and inside that web I can

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,788
see hundreds if not thousands of little

153
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,979
spider mites they're crawling all over

154
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:32,168
the plant every leaf every section of

155
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:34,418
this plant is crispy and crunchy every

156
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:36,128
plant behind it looks like [ __ ] this is

157
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,378
the worst case of spider mites I have

158
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,658
ever seen a photo of and it was in a

159
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,249
grow in Denver where we are allowed to

160
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,868
grow illegally where we are given

161
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:46,389
guidelines on pesticides we can and

162
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:48,550
cannot use and somehow this [ __ ] still

163
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,329
happened so let's read the article it

164
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,669
goes like this

165
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,408
buddies wellness LLC is having a tough

166
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,299
week the Medical Marijuana cultivator

167
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:57,908
which sells its products through the la

168
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,680
bodega dispensary voluntary Reval antara

169
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:02,228
lee recalled its concentrates on July

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,598
25th because of a possible pesticide

171
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,109
contamination but the problem didn't end

172
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,728
there

173
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,259
two days later the city of Denver

174
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,329
announced that buddy's wellness was the

175
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,389
first Denver marijuana grower recalling

176
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:15,819
marijuana for mold and mites that's

177
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,278
right you guys they do test our cannabis

178
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,218
for pesticides we're not allowed to use

179
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:23,558
a lot of pesticides they are banned when

180
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:25,149
they when you grow and a commercial grow

181
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:27,490
before you can sell anything you have to

182
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:30,038
take a sample bud from that grow and

183
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,408
send it to a lab is then tested for mold

184
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,658
its tested for yeast its tested for

185
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:36,248
pesticides the results are sent back and

186
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,658
then once they are sent back the product

187
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,639
is what's called released and we're

188
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:42,308
allowed to move it from the grow

189
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,319
location to retail locations until then

190
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:46,329
it sits in a safe room and it cannot be

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,399
touched by anybody there have been

192
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:51,090
several cases of crops being destroyed

193
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,189
because of pesticides being found in

194
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,469
the product this is the first case of

195
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,750
them destroying and recalling products

196
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,729
for spider mites I think it's ridiculous

197
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,019
that they had spider mites that bad so I

198
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,699
want to continue with the article before

199
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,560
my iPad reloads the page again it throws

200
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,840
me off it goes like this and the second

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,860
recall notice issued Thursday July 27th

202
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,539
by the Denver Department of

203
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,979
Environmental Health any Medical

204
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,110
Marijuana consumers who purchased

205
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,149
medical marijuana barring the optional

206
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,490
premise cultivation code so let me

207
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,138
explain that on every cannabis product d

208
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,819
by I'm just gonna pick up something here

209
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,990
this one this jar right here I've got a

210
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,029
jar from a dispensary in Colorado

211
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,199
Springs it's got their label on it I can

212
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:30,179
find their OPC number this is okay this

213
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,819
came from MMC number medical marijuana

214
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,900
cultivation Center number 402 - and I'm

215
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,040
not gonna read you the numbers from my

216
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,239
product cuz it's not important I don't

217
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,160
want implement their numbers in this

218
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,418
article but I can tell where this came

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,050
from I can tell where this was grown

220
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:46,019
this was grown in MMC number 402 - and

221
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,370
it was extracted by another one that I

222
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,109
can't find the number on here but oh

223
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,329
it's all the same Center this is grown

224
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,310
and extracted by the same people so I

225
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,870
know where that came from if that

226
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,129
product was tainted they would issue a

227
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,689
recall with the number on it

228
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,129
then I would take it back and they would

229
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,538
give me a full refund it probably

230
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,829
exchanged out for a different product it

231
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:04,949
wasn't contaminated to tell you the

232
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:06,779
truth but so everything does have an

233
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,519
optional premise cultivation code on

234
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,989
every container that you buy so they

235
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,918
know where that came from

236
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,689
um let's see anything with the optional

237
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,490
I don't read out the number for you guys

238
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,519
right here anything with the OPC code of

239
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,030
four zero three - zero zero three six

240
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,579
four from la bodega prior to July 27th

241
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,529
you were urged to return or destroy your

242
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,519
product you guys if it's already if you

243
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,138
bought a gram and it's already half a

244
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,949
gram take it back [ __ ] it see what

245
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,120
they'll give you another one see if

246
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,620
they'll return it just because of this

247
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,908
recall take this article with you and be

248
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,810
like no they said to bring it back I

249
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,668
want my money back

250
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,019
if you've already smoked it don't worry

251
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,399
you'll be okay hopefully you're not

252
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,598
gonna get sick from smoking a little bit

253
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,639
of powdery mildew and spider mites

254
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,160
chances are you've smoked a shit-ton

255
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,360
before just didn't know it so just just

256
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,669
act like you didn't know this time also

257
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,870
you'll be ok if you do feel sick from it

258
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,939
if you think you've got some problems

259
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,429
from it go to the doctor and get

260
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,260
yourself checked out powdery mildew and

261
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:59,939
it can make you sick on its own but what

262
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,009
it will do is if you've already got a

263
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,600
compromised immune system powdery mildew

264
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,149
can definitely exacerbate whatever

265
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
problems

266
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,079
you've already got especially if there's

267
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,049
sinus related respiratory related immune

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,639
related any kind of mildew added to that

269
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,769
will definitely [ __ ] you up a little

270
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,259
extra so if you've got product from

271
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,210
there return it I or just throw it away

272
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,100
your choice so I'm gonna continue the

273
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,330
article that goes the deh recall notice

274
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,920
said there have been no reports of

275
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,030
illness from buddies products but noted

276
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,639
that samples of dried marijuana

277
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,919
contained potentially unsafe levels of

278
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,529
yeast and mold while live plants were

279
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,299
found contaminated with mildew and mites

280
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:39,039
let me talk about the yeast and mold um

281
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:40,779
it is very easy to fail a yeast test for

282
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,789
cannabis in Colorado just a little bit

283
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,669
too much moisture for a little bit too

284
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:48,159
long and yeast develops on everything so

285
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,439
you can lose entire crops to just a

286
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,029
little bit of yeast in your post

287
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,950
harvested product a lot of times it

288
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,659
happens after the plants are cut down or

289
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,759
cut down the hang dry they're harvested

290
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,649
they're trimmed they are put in a

291
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,120
container and then somebody closes that

292
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,579
container for too long there's moisture

293
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,470
in there I walks up the moisture the air

294
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,360
they put it in the dark it starts making

295
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,879
a little bit of yeast and then they test

296
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,560
it and the growers think they're curing

297
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,179
the product perfectly but that little

298
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,250
bit of excess moisture creates yeast and

299
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,929
then they fail a microbial test so

300
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,970
that's not a hard test to fail that one

301
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,229
is really easy though with all the other

302
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,320
[ __ ] going on I'm just gonna assume that

303
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,750
these guys are [ __ ] that up to unsafe

304
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,700
levels of yeast and mold so mold is

305
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,169
powdery mildew yeast mold could be bud

306
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,640
rot mold could be a lot of different

307
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:33,429
things we're gonna assume it was a

308
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,019
powdery mildew while live plants oh no

309
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,429
it says they differentiate between

310
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,439
powdery mildew and mites so they had

311
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:40,479
straight bud mold they had moldy bud

312
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,400
in their products while live plants were

313
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,649
found contaminated with mildew and

314
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,079
spider mites they show a picture at the

315
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,759
bottom of the page here this plant has

316
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,259
got enough powdery mildew on it to where

317
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,090
it just looks like a powdered donut it

318
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,889
looks like you just threw powdered donut

319
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,780
sugar all over these plants it is

320
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,379
disgusting I don't know how somebody

321
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,549
worked in there and didn't get sick they

322
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,230
had to have been wearing a respirator

323
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,059
just to walk in there how do they know

324
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,750
not to do something about that that is

325
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,369
so crazy

326
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm gonna continue with the article here

327
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,870
it says the mold recall stems from a deh

328
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,240
investigation to residual levels of mic

329
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,590
let me try to say this right I've never

330
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,850
I've always read this word and I've

331
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,870
never tried to say it out loud I don't

332
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,590
think unless it was on the podcast

333
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,620
Michael

334
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,610
butanol that was easier than it looked

335
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,899
investigation into residual levels of

336
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,909
Michael Oh boots and all found in

337
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,709
buddies trim and concentrates by state

338
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,569
approved cannabis testing labs according

339
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,430
to Department of Health investigation

340
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,290
reports received through a Colorado Open

341
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,659
Records Act requested from West worth

342
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:36,669
that's a really long sentence Mike low

343
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,379
butanol is used to fight powdery mildew

344
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,629
and marijuana as cotton is commonly

345
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,490
found in Eagle 20 a fungicide applied to

346
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:45,939
grapes and other agricultural products

347
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,830
it is banned as a marijuana pesticide by

348
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,240
the Colorado Department of Agriculture

349
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,370
that's right you guys we cannot use that

350
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,019
Eagle 20 in a commercial grow you should

351
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,389
not be using Eagle 20 in your private

352
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,439
grow I try to follow the Colorado

353
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,539
marijuana Enforcement Division

354
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,160
guidelines on any grow that I am in if

355
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:02,889
it is a marijuana Enforcement Division

356
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,539
regulated grow or not if it's a private

357
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,549
girl if it's a commercial growth it's a

358
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:07,990
caregiver grow whatever it is I try to

359
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,669
follow those guidelines because I feel

360
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,840
like they have done their research and

361
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,209
they know what we should and should not

362
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,620
be using and why not just learn how to

363
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,940
do everything based on their rules

364
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,929
because that's the way everything is

365
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,790
heading anyway

366
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,529
if you just learned to play by the rules

367
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,029
you don't have to adjust so strongly

368
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,110
when they start enforcing the rules on

369
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,329
you just follow the rules from the

370
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,470
beginning all right so let's keep moving

371
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,389
in the article that goes like this

372
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,040
buddy's owner and operator Gabriel

373
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,600
Sandoval's says the Mike lo butanol

374
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,639
levels on his trim it concentrates

375
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,070
resulted from a residue left in his

376
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,049
pesticide applicators years ago the

377
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,760
moldy and my infested plants cited by

378
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,409
the DEA CH were plant to put on hold for

379
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,230
pesticide testing that he'd been waiting

380
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:47,500
to destroy so he's saying that the

381
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,879
pesticide was a residual that was left

382
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,529
in the paint sprayer because a lot of

383
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,809
these guys use a paint sprayer as an

384
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,970
applicator I was left in the pesticide

385
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:57,309
applicators years ago so he didn't clean

386
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,240
out his paint sprayer for years is that

387
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,979
what he's trying to say that it's just

388
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,210
been in there for years because you're

389
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,470
supposed to clean those out when you get

390
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,060
done using another what kind of sprayer

391
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,470
you're using you're supposed to triple a

392
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08,199
wrench that rinse that [ __ ] before he

393
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,639
put anything else in it so that sounds

394
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,110
fishy did he just let it sit for a

395
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,580
couple of years did he not clean it has

396
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,100
he not sprayed anything else through it

397
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,810
that doesn't sound right to me but he

398
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,639
also says that the plants that were

399
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,289
moldy were plants that were put on hold

400
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,669
for pesticide testing that he'd been

401
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:23,589
waiting to destroy so he wasn't even

402
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:25,479
taking care of the plants that were

403
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,040
going to be tested to see if they were

404
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,960
contaminated with pesticides because he

405
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,610
knew he had to destroy him he goes on to

406
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,450
say they told us not to spray anything

407
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,370
before

408
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,170
we took the initial test so we left it

409
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,060
alone they said this stuff was going to

410
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:38,500
get destroyed he says I didn't want to

411
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,969
waste money on lights and water to

412
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,669
maintain them because I knew they

413
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,350
weren't going to make it so he saw on

414
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:46,809
him that he was told not to spray

415
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,460
anything which doesn't make sense

416
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,629
because you're allowed to spray even if

417
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,710
they're coming they want to know what

418
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,879
you're spraying that's why you're

419
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,379
spraying that's why they're coming to

420
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,509
check they're making sure you're doing

421
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,620
[ __ ] right and he didn't want to keep

422
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,519
feeding the plants and taking care of

423
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,440
the plants because he knew they were

424
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,730
going to get destroyed how did he know

425
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,410
they were gonna get destroyed did he

426
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,610
know they were not going to pass test

427
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,289
because if they would have passed test

428
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,850
it would not have there would have been

429
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:08,769
no need to destroy them they were only

430
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,690
going to be destroyed if they failed the

431
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,029
test so he knew they were not going to

432
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,560
pass these tests he quit feeding him he

433
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:16,809
just quit taking care of them so let's

434
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,459
continue with the article sand of all

435
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,929
should have maintained the plants well

436
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,720
enough to keep fungus and pests at bay

437
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:24,759
according to a de H investigation report

438
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,340
filed right before the July 27th recall

439
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,189
was ordered based upon visual evidence

440
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,870
of insects and mold on live flowering

441
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,880
plants in the facility statements from

442
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,200
staff regarding pervasiveness of insects

443
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,269
and mold within the facility and

444
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,950
laboratory reports listing high levels

445
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:40,600
of yeast and mold and dried plant

446
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,250
material the Denver Department of

447
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Environmental Health find sufficient

448
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,090
evidence that plant material is

449
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,550
potentially unsafe for human consumption

450
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,170
the report reads God I'm glad I've never

451
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,269
had cannabis with that label on it

452
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,649
unsafe for human consumption that's a

453
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,299
[ __ ] up stamp to put on your product

454
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,919
it keeps going it says despite

455
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,990
Sandoval's claims that he was ordered to

456
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,500
not spray or clean the plants for 72

457
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,350
hours

458
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,629
deah food a deh food safety and

459
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,610
marijuana program supervisor carolyn

460
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,529
Lavo says that any marijuana plant put

461
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,360
on hold by the DEA CH can be fully

462
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,039
maintained and that includes allowing

463
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,289
the application of Colorado Department

464
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,439
of Agriculture approved fungicide and

465
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,969
pesticides yes that is a pretty sure

466
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,010
that that's a clear thing anybody that

467
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,600
works in the and an Emmy deregulated

468
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,069
facility should know that anybody with

469
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,779
any worker protection safety training

470
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,610
should know that anybody with any

471
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,929
Department of Ag training should know

472
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,120
that and if you work in these facilities

473
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,189
as a master grower that is your

474
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,210
responsibility to know that [ __ ] and if

475
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,500
you don't know that [ __ ] you got to call

476
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,820
the lawyer you got to call the owner you

477
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,019
got to call the compliance officer you

478
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,120
got to call somebody and figure it out

479
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,259
quit [ __ ] it up so if you're in

480
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,269
charge of a girl find out what you are

481
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,769
and are not allowed to do because this

482
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,688
is serious right now you guys

483
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,188
I'm gonna continue with the article but

484
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:50,469
first let's talk about this picture

485
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:53,259
buddy's wellness destroyed every plant

486
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,928
in its Cedar Avenue grow on July 27th

487
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,489
there's a picture of a warehouse with

488
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:58,988
some five-gallon buckets with some

489
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,670
shitty looking dirt in there

490
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:03,129
it looks like cocoa with not enough

491
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,419
perlite and they've got tomato cages on

492
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:08,079
it but all the plants are just chopped

493
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:11,458
down on the floor they have got 5 gallon

494
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,778
buckets of cocoa on a concrete floor

495
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,979
that's not a professional set up get the

496
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:17,889
plants up off the [ __ ] floor you guys

497
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,420
come on so anyway it says the July 27th

498
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,999
recall came on the same day that the

499
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:24,428
that buddy's voluntarily destroyed every

500
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:27,519
plant in its growth throwing away 72

501
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:29,649
flowering plants 119 vegging plants and

502
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,448
nearly 20 pounds of dried flower

503
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,548
according to a Department of Health

504
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,019
investigation report I feel like they're

505
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:37,088
trying to shut us down Sandoval says

506
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,379
we're a small family-run business so

507
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,749
this is a nightmare

508
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,808
yes this may sound like some [ __ ] to

509
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:45,610
you but as a small family-run business

510
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:47,860
this should never happen if it's a small

511
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,720
family-run business those very few

512
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,519
plants I've got more plants than that in

513
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,079
one room at the grow I run at Three

514
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,078
Rivers I've got more plants than that in

515
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,849
one small space I can take care of that

516
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,859
I could have taken care of this girl by

517
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,379
myself and not have gotten as many

518
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,449
problems with two pesticide applications

519
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,490
per week and then a release of predator

520
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,288
mites just a couple of weeks into flower

521
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,578
they never would have had this problem

522
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,750
but they were not paying attention they

523
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,119
were trying to be cheap they're trying

524
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,099
to cut corners I I can assume I don't

525
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,168
know what happened but they were failing

526
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,338
this is a very small grow this guy is

527
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,439
trying to say we're a small mom-and-pop

528
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,759
business if you're that small this

529
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,720
should not have been a problem he should

530
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,859
have been able to get in there and

531
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,199
[ __ ] take care of these pests by

532
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,178
yourself I can tell that these plants

533
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,558
are not be foliated they're mites all

534
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,700
over every leaf if you would have pulled

535
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,500
off some of the leaves you'd have taken

536
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,759
off a lot of the opportunity for powdery

537
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,380
mildew to grow you would have taken off

538
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,470
a lot of opportunity for spider mites to

539
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,539
hang out these guys don't seem to have

540
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,798
done anything to prevent bugs or powdery

541
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,028
mildew they don't seem to know what they

542
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:44,408
needed to do by the looks of the

543
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,269
pictures I'm gonna continue with the

544
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,100
article the de-age pictures below show a

545
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,288
cultivation riddled with powdery mildew

546
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,119
and spider mites Sandoval says he's

547
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:53,740
destroyed it decided to destroy those

548
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,808
plants weeks before the photos were

549
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,638
taken but wasn't allowed to do so until

550
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,059
Department of Health and marijuana and

551
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,709
for

552
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,019
and division agents were present per

553
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,460
state regulations he says the plants

554
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,589
pictured below were destroyed the same

555
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,230
days the photos were taken on July 5th

556
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:10,359
and July 21st and deh investigator

557
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,710
Richard prep ler confirms that sand of

558
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,229
all destroyed the plants after the

559
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,329
pictures were snapped so in a case like

560
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,160
this you guys normally on a normal day

561
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,289
if I've got a plant in the grow and I

562
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,930
decide hey I don't need this plant I can

563
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,789
destroy it I cut it down it goes through

564
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,289
a wood chipper it's considered green

565
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,210
waste it has to be destroyed towards

566
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:29,799
unrecognizable it goes through a wood

567
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,140
chipper it gets mixed into a bag with

568
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,849
kitty litter and leftover soil so now it

569
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,440
is mulch you can't get to it then it is

570
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,839
put into a trash can that is locked and

571
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,789
it's removed by a trash service the only

572
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,429
thing I have to do is go to my computer

573
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:44,319
and mark that plant number that it's

574
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,640
killed and that plant no longer exists I

575
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,200
have to cut the plant tag in half and

576
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,570
throw that away now that plant is dead

577
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,309
it does not exist in my system in a case

578
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:53,439
like this when they've got contaminated

579
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,990
plants they have to be destroyed under

580
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,670
supervision people from the meed and the

581
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,349
Department of Ag and the Department of

582
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,910
Health come and watch you destroy these

583
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,709
plants to make sure they are not snuck

584
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,330
out the back door to make sure that you

585
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,430
don't do anything fishy with them I hope

586
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,689
they watch them destroy the 20 pounds of

587
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,490
herb that they said they had to get rid

588
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,470
of also because I don't want that [ __ ]

589
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,880
to make it to the black market you guys

590
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,829
that's why black market cannabis is

591
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,540
dangerous because there's all kinds of

592
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,619
[ __ ] sprayed in it there's no regulation

593
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,240
there are no rules

594
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:20,439
there could be East there could be mold

595
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,359
there could be mites they could be

596
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,529
having fungus in there and they don't

597
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,329
give a [ __ ] because they need to make

598
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,519
their money and nobody's ever gonna come

599
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:29,349
look so I would recommend that you go

600
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,240
through a dispensary if you were in

601
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:33,490
Colorado and get your cannabis through a

602
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,190
dispensary it's been tested it is safe

603
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,079
if it's not tested it gets destroyed so

604
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,299
I'm gonna keep going we don't enjoy

605
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,009
doing this deh investigator Kelsey

606
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,259
Hanley says commenting on the city

607
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,640
destroying plants and issuing recalls we

608
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,480
try our best to work with them but

609
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,490
mistakes happen

610
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,529
Gabriel's doing his best to correct them

611
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,450
the DEA CH has issued nearly a hundred

612
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,980
public recalls for marijuana products

613
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,170
but virtually all of them were recalled

614
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,269
because of pesticides Laveau says

615
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,880
buddy's recall is the first ever issued

616
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,220
for mold or mites buddies now has until

617
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,320
Sunday July 31st to contact business and

618
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,850
medical patients with available contact

619
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,649
information who purchased la bodega

620
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:11,349
products in the last three months to

621
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,990
advise them of the recall and then there

622
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,959
are some photo

623
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,690
and it says here are the pictures your

624
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,450
deh photos of the now destroyed plants

625
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:23,058
this plant I cannot see through the

626
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,380
webbing to find where the plant is this

627
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:26,509
one just looks like they put a plastic

628
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,190
bag right over the plant and then just

629
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:31,490
build the plastic bag with spider mites

630
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,289
this next picture is got so much spider

631
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,740
white what spider might webbing on it it

632
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,269
looks like cotton this one shows that

633
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,829
was a nice plant until it got [ __ ]

634
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,440
riddled with mice these guys know how to

635
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:44,149
grow decently they just don't know how

636
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,549
to take care of pests oh look at this

637
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:50,030
powdery mildew you guys this plant is

638
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,980
very sparse it's not very very branchy

639
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:54,740
it's not very beefy but the powdery

640
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,150
mildew looks just like a powdered donut

641
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,549
it just looks like you dunk this butter

642
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,809
and sugar it is so gross all right

643
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,428
that's all the pictures in this article

644
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:03,619
you guys if you bought anything at

645
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,540

646
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,549
back and exchange that or just return it

647
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,720
get your money back or if you just

648
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,519
bought one gram and it's far away to

649
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,079
smoke and throw it away don't smoke it

650
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,460
don't make yourself sick it probably

651
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,169
gross yourself out when you hear those

652
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,200

653

654
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,650

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,730
pest management powdery mildew

682
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,080
management but he gets different when

683
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,940
you're on a large scale so if you've got

684
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,669

let me know we will talk about it hey

686
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,150
you know what let's not even waste time

687
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,590
things that are approved by the Colorado

688
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,240
marijuana Enforcement Division and the

689
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,649
Colorado Department of Agriculture that

690
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,490
you can apply to your plants to keep

691
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,970
away powdery

692
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,519
do um early in the phase or early in veg

693
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,589
or before a flower you can use a product

694
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,950
called trying to remember the name

695
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:39,919
banished banished is oils banished also

696
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,410
has a buddy product called smite smites

697
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,200
for spider mites banish is for mildew

698
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,970
they both work there are both oils do

699
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,410
not apply them with the lights on they

700
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,850
will burn the [ __ ] out of your plants if

701
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,140
you spray them and have lights on make

702
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:54,529
sure you turn the lights off if you

703
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:59,179
smite or banish in flower for powdery

704
00:22:54,529 --> 00:23:01,190
mildew I recommend 0 tall 0 tall smells

705
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,720
like hell it's mostly peroxide it

706
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,490
doesn't leave a smell on your plants it

707
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,039
doesn't leave any residue on the plants

708
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,049
but it does destroy powdery mildew on

709
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,909
contact it will dissolve the powdery

710
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,379
mildew it will stop the growth with a

711
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,150
couple applications you will destroy it

712
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,760
and then you'll rinse it right off it

713
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,820
will be gone you can mix 0 tall with the

714
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,069
product called cease cease is a

715
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:25,399
beneficial bacteria in a carrier agent

716
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,899
and it smells like [ __ ] but when you mix

717
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,500
the 0 tall and he makes the cease

718
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,290
together

719
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,480
the cease is one of the only bacterias

720
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,980
the 0 tall will not kill so they will

721
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,679
not destroy the other product you can

722
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,089
mix the 0 tall I would do 0 tall how

723
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,269
much 0 tall do you want to use I would

724
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:43,569
say 35 milliliters of 0 tall per gallon

725
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:47,299
of water so get your gallon of water add

726
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:50,569
35 mils of 0 tall and add 45 milliliters

727
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,669
of cease stir the [ __ ] out of it put in

728
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,529
a nice score of like Coco wet or some

729
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,720
sort of wetting agent then just douse

730
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,308
the plants with that leave the lights

731
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,200
off while you douse it let the plants

732
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,420
dry turn the lights back on after one or

733
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,610
two applications 3 days apart you should

734
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,740
at least knock down the powdery mildew

735
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,539
one more application about 3 or 4 days

736
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,630
later you won't have powdery mildew

737
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:13,220
anymore you guys 0 tall and cease ok

738
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,690
don't tell anybody I said that because

739
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,579
those are trade secrets in the industry

740
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,259
I just don't want you guys having

741
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,099
powdery mildew that's how important it

742
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,019
is to me alright

743
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,519
also try to figure out why you're

744
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:24,558
getting powdery mildew is there too much

745
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,910
moisture in the room is there not enough

746
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,889
airflow do you have too many plants

747
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,940
crammed together maybe you need to do

748
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,309
more defoliation

749
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,170
ID foliate heavily when it comes time to

750
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,000
harvest you don't have to take off any

751
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,289
families because I've already D foliated

752
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,240
them throughout the flowering cycle

753
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,470
about a week before harvest

754
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,359
I'll go through and pull off every other

755
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,308
leaf that's been left and then by

756
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,868
harvest time they're naked so just don't

757
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:47,028
be afraid to defoliate don't be afraid

758
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:48,980
to apply the proper fungicides at the

759
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,628
right time you should be able to get rid

760
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,368
of your powdery mildew you guys you can

761
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:55,519
apply the zero tall and the cease mix

762
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:57,798
very late in flower up to like the last

763
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,440
week of bloom you should be just fine

764
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,730
because the zero tolerance it kills what

765
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,548
it needs to kill and then it evaporates

766
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,409
or dissipates the cease I would cut that

767
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:08,418
out maybe one or two weeks before a

768
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,610
flower but it will not leave a flavor it

769
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:12,379
won't leave any problems just apply it

770
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,969
carefully give it time to dry before you

771
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:16,428
turn on the lights and have plenty of

772
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,919
airflow in the room until harvest time

773
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:20,509
all right that was a whole lot of talk

774
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,070
from one article I do have more stuff

775
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,298
planned for the podcast I did not want

776
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:25,009
to just do the whole episode on this

777
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:26,538
article so let me press pause for a

778
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:28,909
second I'm gonna take a dab of this

779
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:30,079
screaming tangerine I'm gonna drink a

780
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,700
little bit of water and get my voice

781
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:43,278
corrected and then I'll be right back

782
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:45,350
with more podcasting all right podcast

783
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,909
world I am back I fulfilled all of my

784
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,859
promises I drank water

785
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:50,539
I took dabs and I am back for more

786
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:52,248
podcasting I want to give a shout out to

787
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:54,079
some friends I'm not sure how much I

788
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,759
should say but a friend of mine was here

789
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,128
a little bit ago and they visited and

790
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,519
they left me some strain specific CBD

791
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:04,428
Terp sugar I've got some granddaddy purp

792
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:07,099
CBD Turk sugar I'm not a huge fan of the

793
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,899
CBD CBD does not do a lot for me I think

794
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,849
that there are patients out there that

795
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:13,459
should be smoking the CBD so I give it

796
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:15,798
to them and I do not waste it but this

797
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,210
stuff tastes [ __ ] amazing

798
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:21,079
this granddaddy purp CBD Terp sugar I

799
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,730
recommend that if you are looking for

800
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,189

801

817
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,449
trying to get through them so let's cut

818
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,000
the chitchat and get right to an email

819
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,650
this one is from a person who doesn't

820
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,089
say if I should use their name or not I

821
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,309
don't know if I want to get them in

822
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:07,259
trouble so we're just gonna call you al

823
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:09,720
the message goes like this I've started

824
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,849
using veg bloom shine push and plus life

825
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,130
on your recommendation I'm still using

826
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:15,599
Mills as my base I'm a little nervous to

827
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,059
switch because I get pretty decent

828
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,919
numbers veg bloom would be about five

829
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:22,289
hundred dollars cheaper a cycle if I

830
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,480
made the switch anyway do you follow the

831
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:26,519
recommendation to just use shine at one

832
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,440
gram a gallon from week seven until

833
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,319
flush I'm trying to wrap my head around

834
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,230
using only shot my water is ro so my

835
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,710
plants will only beginning 200 ppm after

836
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,849
I add the shine a lot of things in here

837
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,269
I want to address

838
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:44,879
I do recommend veg bloom with the shine

839
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,099
push and plus life it is a very simple

840
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,320
program although I would definitely

841
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,669
recommend adding things to it if you're

842
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,349
an experienced grower and you want to

843
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,720
push your garden there are things you

844
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:57,359
can add to it and it will not mess you

845
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,440
up I like to add carbohydrates sometimes

846
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,990
I find that I need a little bit of

847
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,240
cal-mag but if you're using Mills as

848
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,099
your base I think your plants are going

849
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,950
to be really happy with additions of

850
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,719
shine push and plus life I wouldn't

851
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,340
switch honestly if you're happy with

852
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,950
what you're getting if you're getting

853
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:15,569
pretty decent numbers stay there even if

854
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,069
it is a little bit cheaper five hundred

855
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,359
dollars right now that's not a lot of

856
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:20,039
money if you're running a big crop

857
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:21,389
especially if you're spending $500 on

858
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,399
nutrients I'd imagine you're pulling a

859
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,920
pretty nice harvest I would stick with

860
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,460
the mills I would basically just just

861
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,289
like you did add the shine the push and

862
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,529
the plus life to the Mills recipe just

863
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,928
like it is I don't use the the veg bloom

864
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:39,240
base just use the additives don't use

865
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:41,309
our oh don't use dirty don't use HD

866
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,200
don't use any of the base use your Mills

867
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:44,789
base that is working that's going to

868
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,490
work beautifully in my opinion I think

869
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,139
the shine will increase your resin

870
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,240
production it might add a little bit

871
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,890
more weight to it the push is definitely

872
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,650
going to add vigor to your plants the

873
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,750
push makes the plants go much faster

874
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,300
iein plus life is going you're just

875
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,309
gonna see more vigor happier plants with

876
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,470
a plus life so keep using that stuff use

877
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:05,788
the mills that's what I would do then

878
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,350
you go on to say anyway

879
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:09,479
do you follow the recommendation to use

880
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:12,269
just shine at one gram a gallon from

881
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:14,278
week seven and sell flush I do not do

882
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:16,229
that I always add stuff when I'm using

883
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,388
vegetable and honestly when I'm

884
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:21,269
switching to the flush phase that late I

885
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:23,308
increase my shine to two grams per

886
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,499
gallon and start reducing my base

887
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:27,989
nutrients so reduce everything a little

888
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:29,700
bit and then use two grams of shine and

889
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:32,220
then when it comes time to flush I'm in

890
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,778
cocoa and my commercial grow so it's

891
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,729
really easy to flush things out and I

892
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:37,798
don't feel like shine builds up a lot so

893
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:39,598
I'll use two grams of shine plus a few

894
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:41,700
other things until about the last ten

895
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:43,589
days I'll you shine for the last feed

896
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,929
and then it gets just a week of just

897
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,519
straight water pH and then it gets

898
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:49,919
flushed out real heavily I make sure

899
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,528
there's plenty of runoff on the cocoa we

900
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,359
try to get like 20 maybe 25 percent

901
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:55,710
runoff during flush time to make sure

902
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:57,658
that that cocoa is really cleaning

903
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,149
itself out and if you look at my photos

904
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,330
on Instagram I'm I reenter score

905
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:05,098
genetics I RIE underscore genetics you

906
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:06,269
can see when the plants start showing me

907
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,829
that they've been properly flushed

908
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:11,579
that's how I know my flush is on point

909
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:13,858
we're also measuring the TDS the EC and

910
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,628
the PPM's and the pH that come out of

911
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:17,220
the bottom of the water so we know what

912
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:19,469
we're getting we know what we put in we

913
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,200
know what came out so I think the two

914
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,239
grams of shine at the end right until

915
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,090
flush time I go I don't do it through

916
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,769
flush I give myself a flush but I think

917
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:29,939
the shine that to Graham's really does

918
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,979
something to the plants that makes them

919
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,739
sparkly it makes them beefy I would

920
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:37,440
continue to add a base nutrient up until

921
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:40,288
flush time I of course get your flush

922
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,580
time get that 7 to 14 day flush time if

923
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,319
you're in a hydro base if you're in

924
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:46,138
cocoa seven to ten days is cool if

925
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:48,058
you're in a soilless mix 14 days you can

926
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:50,069
even go 21 days if you'd like to but

927
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,749
you're missing opportunities in my

928
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,460
opinion if you that one extra week of

929
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,679
feeding is miss is a missed opportunity

930
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,710
if you don't give it nutrients ah I

931
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,629
would not go with just shine to the end

932
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,220
I would add some base nutrients whatever

933
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:04,288
else you think you need maybe a light

934
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,909
bloom booster with the shine will really

935
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:07,739
chunk it up as long as you do give it

936
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:09,659
the flush period of just water at the

937
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:12,358
end so I guess if you've got a nine-week

938
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:15,119
plant and you're running hydro or cocoa

939
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:17,220
add it add the two grams of shine up to

940
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:19,348
week eight along with your base Newt

941
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,680
along with the bloom booster maybe you

942
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,629
might

943
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,460
cal-mag at that point I don't know I've

944
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,660
noticed if you use too much cal-mag too

945
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,579
late in flower you can [ __ ]

946
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,279
definitely taste it so be careful on

947
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:30,929
that but use use that stuff up to week

948
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,269
seven or eight and then week nine should

949
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,130
just be clean water all flush that's how

950
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:37,230
I would do it I wouldn't want to put the

951
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,450
shine in there for the last week I just

952
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,250
don't find it necessary and I don't want

953
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,890
to taste it and I don't want my buds to

954
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,450
burn weird so if you got nine weeks feed

955
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,850
it for seven maybe give it shine for

956
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,470
week eight then flush but that does

957
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:52,139
greatly depend on your medium you guys

958
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,970
like I said any type of like a hydro

959
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,830
stuff you can feed it up to that that

960
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,779
week before flush if you're in soilless

961
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:59,490
mix give yourself two weeks you don't

962
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,470
want to taste cal-mag you don't want to

963
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,700
taste shine you don't want to taste any

964
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,900
of these funky things I'm not sure

965
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,180
what's in Cheyenne I don't know how long

966
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,460
it'll stick around how heavy it is how

967
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,840
hard it is to flush out I don't want it

968
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,259
to make your buds burn I wouldn't risk

969
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,849
it

970
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:13,230
alright I hope answered quote your

971
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,029
question clearly there's a lot of

972
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,190
information there I had a lot to say if

973
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,599
I just sparked more questions feel free
