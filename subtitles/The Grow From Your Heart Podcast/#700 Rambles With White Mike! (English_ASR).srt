00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
pueblo for sensible cannabis laws mike i

66
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,598
think i've asked you a long time ago and

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,518
if this isn't appropriate for the show

68
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,280
we can edit it out where did nemo punk

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,640
15 come from what the hell does that

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,519
mean bro so the 15 is the age when i

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,919
came up with the handle wow i was

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,759
creating my first hotmail account like

73
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,598
that's how old that is

74
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,120
so i i don't necessarily want to say the

75
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,159
number of years that account has been

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
around

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,919
but that was my first hotmail account

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,800
way back in the day and it has just

79
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,439
survived and when i first created a

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,159
twitter handle i did it as a joke so

81
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,158
that i could hassle a huffington post

82
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,000
live personality

83
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,598
on twitter

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,919
and like i never thought it would go

85
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,679
anywhere and then here we are i don't

86
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,399
know a decade later

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,159
all right that's the story 15 comes from

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,039
well that's the 15. what what's nemo

89
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,919
punk

90
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,878

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
a good dude now you're an adult now but

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
if we would have known each other

96
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,000
in our teens we would have gotten in a

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
lot more trouble than we did uh without

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,158
being friends with each other yeah yeah

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,239

100
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,079

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239

right thing to do behind the scenes

167
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,240
action but yes i've been missing being

168
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,519
on the podcast i've been dragging my

169
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
feet getting

170
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,359
the new office space set up and getting

171
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
and

173
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,399

178
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,319
i like the new background it's nice and

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,519
uh i like the dark set up there it's

180
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,720
just dark enough to you're not a

181
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,799
floating head but you are still

182
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
mysterious i have no idea what's

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
happening three feet behind you

184
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,079
yeah one of the one of the kids needed

185
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,720
my other light source ass

186
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,318
so i am shy one light source right now

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,120
but everything else is up and running

188
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
and still functional after

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
like so much stuff has happened since

190
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,918
the last time i was in the podcast there

191
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
was major construction in the space we

192
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,680
had to tear concrete out with a

193
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,519
jackhammer and install

194
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,600
when you say there was a flood everybody

195
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,599
just goes oh like anybody that's had a

196
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,280
basement flood they go oh they feel

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,879
empathetic or sympathetic or they get

198
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,279
feelings and they understand like yeah i

199
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,038
know what you mean brother so yeah we

200
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,439
understand that flood sets you back

201
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,639
quite a bit

202
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,399
there's nothing like fighting four

203
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,918
inches of water come pouring out of your

204
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,918
concrete floor

205
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,000
that was a fun night

206
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,519
uh you said something about equipment

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
and i do want to reassure the people

208
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
that this is the uh a rare zoom type

209
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
video for me usually i do have the

210
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,839
multicam four camera 4k

211
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,120
camera there were words in there that

212
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,439
were meant to make sense multi camera 4k

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
camera setup that was really hard to say

214
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,199
4k cameras yeah usually i have that

215
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,038
going this is a rare zoom occasion i'm

216
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,680
using the the macbook camera here looks

217
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,839
pretty good in my opinion uh but uh the

218
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
other night camera two i recorded a full

219
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,679
show on it and camera two did not record

220
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,038
so i'm having both of those cameras uh

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
they're they're in timeout right now and

222
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,318
then once they get fixed we'll be able

223
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
to do the episodes on those and maybe

224
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
just maybe there may be time uh funding

225
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,359
for an upgrade here because the patreon

226
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,359
folks have been helping us out so much

227
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
for so long that it may be time to add

228
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
another camera a better camera so i do

229
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,519
assure you i do promise this zoom thing

230
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
this uh one camera thing is not going to

231
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,878
be forever i know i've set expectations

232
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,079
and i will deliver those um yeah

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000

243
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,639

amazing thank you

245
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
yeah sitting here at episode 700.

246
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
we've come a long way from that old

247
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
coffee table

248
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,478
when you put your arms down you'd almost

249
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,839
feel like you got letters imprinted on

250
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,318
it because people had written so many

251
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,918
things that had just like hieroglyphics

252
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
like melted into it

253
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,158
yeah there was a lot of dabs stuck to it

254
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
on top of it yeah there was a lot of

255
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,399
burn marks on that table

256
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
that table got a lot of use

257
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,278
the

258
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
dab stuck to the top of that table we're

259
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,360
felony weight in some states yes you

260
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,278
could probably scrape up enough enough

261
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
residual concentrates off that table to

262
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,519
take a couple of fat dabs the table did

263
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
go through hell uh big shout out to oil

264
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320

265
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,439
an instagram live an oil sling came on

266
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
and they're like why don't you have a

267
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
big

268
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
excuse that that's from the dabs before

269
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,600
the show

270
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,679
they're like why don't you have a big

271
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,278
oil slick pad for that table and i said

272
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,879
because you didn't send it yet

273
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,080
and he said give me your p.o box and

274
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,080
check that [ __ ] in a couple of days and

275
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
seriously five days later there's a big

276
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,399
table sized oil slick pad in there so

277
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,480
that was pretty awesome

278
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,159
covered the entire table was perfect so

279
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
couldn't get i just cleaned it real easy

280
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,519
wipe it down with a little alcohol it

281
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,959
didn't mess anything up it was great but

282
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,519
yeah so we went from uh crappy recording

283
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,599
i used my old uh that first episode with

284
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,200
you and kevin is hilarious i listen to

285
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
it like at least once a year just to

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
remind myself where we the show started

287
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,719
when people tell me that they're a new

288
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
listener and they've gone back and

289
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
they're like i've listened to the whole

290
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,519
catalog i'm like oh man i'm like thank

291

293
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,879
don't don't judge me like i'm so much

294
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,320
better at this by now i wasn't sure

295
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,159
i wasn't sure what we were doing yet i

296
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
didn't know that what the goal was i

297
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,240
wanted to have more of a hangout smoke

298
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,080
party vibe but also i like teaching so i

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
kind of narrowed it down to me just

300
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
giving you a good lesson i feel like

301
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,839
it's more uh more what i was trying to

302
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,919
do

303
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,760
but i started using the old that

304
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,599
equipment i used came from when i was a

305

mixing board all kinds of [ __ ] i had

308
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,039
compression because wade was blowing out

309
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320

310
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,439

his name but big up to slop bizzle uh he

330
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,560

332
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,879

333
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,399
makes things wonky but i had a bunch of

334
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,078
people over garden of weed and crew was

335

337
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,439
took a fat dab out of a rig with no

338
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,159
water in it that was a that was an

339
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
experience the email it slow baked all

340
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,799
the water out of the ring yeah it

341
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,720
evaporated everything cold glass rig the

342
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,958
glass was warm enough to slowly bake

343
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
water out of itself

344
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,000
yummy dabs

345
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,439
man

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,759
this time

347
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
yeah so we went from all that wonky

348
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,799
recording equipment to the

349
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,439
zoom h6 now i'm using a zoom pod track

350
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,639
four during the pandemic i got inspired

351
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,399
to i don't remember what around 560 i

352
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,919
think i started doing videos and i was

353
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,440
using the macbook and just using the

354
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,559
screen on the mac

355
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,320
uh that was fun but it didn't seem

356
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,638
as good as it could be i knew i could do

357
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
better and just having this weird frame

358
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
of view was different so i bought a

359
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,639
camera and a real camera and then i set

360
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,480
up 4k camera then i bought a i learned

361
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,560
how to do that i learned how to edit in

362
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
final cut pro so i bought a camera which

363
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,559
resulted in buying a new computer

364
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
because the camera uh i dumped that file

365
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,479
into the computer and the computer went

366
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
that's funny yeah so i had to go buy a

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
brand new computer that could handle the

368
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,720
editing and processing i was trying to

369
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
do i was like well if i'm gonna spend

370
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
the money on that let's [ __ ] get

371
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,519

stuff i've just done enough sound guy

388
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,119
stuff to where it's ingrained in me

389
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,720
i'm curious after the show i want to

390
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,399
know what what where you what makes you

391
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,759
think that what you see that or my sound

392
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,200
guys no it's

393
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,720
uh like

394
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,320
right now for a hundred dollars i

395
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
couldn't list a piece of equipment you'd

396
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,839
named off other than like

397
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
because that [ __ ] failed on you like a

398
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,800
hundred times i remember the old

399
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,360
headphone amp that i wanted to throw

400
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,319
through the wall several times yep

401
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
there was

402
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
i'm trying to remember which piece of

403
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
equipment had the lights that would

404
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
hypnotize me when i got too baked oh

405
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,120
that's funny that would probably with

406
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,079
the compressed audio lights that would

407
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
bounce

408
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,679
and they would get real hypnotic when

409
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,159
when the show got

410
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,359
rambly i love it but then yeah then you

411
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,639
would just get more rambly and it would

412
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,519
get more hypnotic um dude we're close to

413
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,919
10 000 youtube subscribers uh for a

414
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,198
little show that yeah 10 000 subscribers

415
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,879
700 episodes i had no idea uh i i

416
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,159
thought maybe when we started like 100

417
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,559
episodes would be the goal and when we

418
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,480
hit 100 i was like 250 would be fun and

419
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,078
then at 250 i was like yeah 500 seems

420
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
like a cool goal and then at 500

421
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,799
something was like yeah just do it dude

422
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,439
it's it's working don't stop

423
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,519
yeah by 500 i think everybody knew it

424
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
was on like officially this was just

425
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
going to be a steady

426
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,078
every monday you could count on it i

427
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,159
can't believe you haven't missed a

428
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,159
monday and 700 episodes dude dude

429
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,759
haven't missed a monday on the podcast

430
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,480
and i don't think i've missed a monday

431
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,319
on the instagram live uh that's false

432
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,440
because there was a time period where my

433
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,959
instagram account was deactivated

434
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
yeah and then sometimes they block me

435
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,719
from going live uh sometimes they close

436
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,240
my inbox right i can read the messages

437
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
but i can't reply instagram and they

438
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,560
like to toy with us a little bit but uh

439
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,599
yeah for the most part for

440
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,518
700 episodes like six years-ish i have

441
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,199
not missed a monday and i do my best to

442
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,560
put out a show every thursday as well i

443
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,719

444
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,838
thursday so yeah

445
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
thanks for noticing that bro i

446
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,279
appreciate that uh

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
sometimes it's a struggle and sometimes

448
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,000
people are like you wanna go do this and

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
i'm like ah i know i gotta record a

450
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,360

451
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
i'm like oh no no no no it's tuesday

452
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
it's podcast day the whole world might

453
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
erupt

454
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,480
yeah your inbox would never recover if

455
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,638
you missed a monday that's that is the

456
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,560
damn truth uh and then the whole flow of

457
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
everything would just be wrong

458
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,919
um i feel like i'm working my way

459
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
through the notes here pretty good the

460
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,919
evolution of the show has been great um

461
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
the only thing left to do is like learn

462
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,479
how to podcast better and then get more

463
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,800
guests on i need to get uh more people

464
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,560
on i need to be on more shows uh and

465
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,559
maybe possibly some camera upgrades but

466
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,638
i think everything else bro evolution is

467
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,159
slowly happening pretty well i am

468
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,639
excited for the 7 10 show i've been

469

about being hyped for the 710 show and i

475
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
was like the

476
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,278

00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,879
discord send us some great questions and

492
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,198
i have a concentrate maker or two in

493
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,039
mind i'm gonna try to do this type of a

494
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,838
setup with them uh so there will be

495
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,639
another zoom uh podcast coming up for

496
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,279
710 but it will be worth it if i get who

497
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,680
i'm really trying to book onto the show

498
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,639
i love it good hash content is so rare

499
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,599
and there's still a lot of

500
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,560
just confusion in non-exposure when it

501
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,639
comes to the modern hash so yes

502
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,039
content the person i hope to have on i'm

503
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,799
hoping that they can kind of teach us uh

504
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,000
how to take our garden

505
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,838
from from seed or clone all the way to

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,198
smokable usable hash without breaking

507
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,480
any laws without using any uh illegal uh

508
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,758
solvents because they've made if you're

509
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
making butane hash at home you're

510
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
technically breaking the law so he's

511
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,360
gonna teach us i'm hoping they can teach

512
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,279
us how to wash it possibly press it

513
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,798
maybe find one person that washes one

514
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,279
person that presses maybe the same guy

515
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,879
will do both maybe two guys that do both

516
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,798
and let them just give us a rundown of

517
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
what they do i've got a bunch of good

518
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,558
questions lined up i'm sure the discord

519
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,000
server my friends on discord have a lot

520
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,000
of good questions patreon will have a

521
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,160
good questions coming uh patreon guys if

522
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you're watching this and gals patreon

523
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
supporters uh if you're watching this

524
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
and you have good questions for a

525
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,160
concentrate maker go ahead and send them

526
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
up on patreon to do my best to get those

527
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
on the show for you but that should be

528
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,798
the gateway to getting me more people on

529
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,640
the show i've been hesitant shy of uh

530
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,639
i'm not a good interviewer dude i just

531
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
uh i don't know

532
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
it's a weird time for it

533
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,959
and like everything's just hard right

534
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
now travel and

535
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,360
getting people around places and the

536
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,279
video chat's gotten substantially better

537
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,240
than it was four years ago but oh yeah

538
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,519
yeah

539
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,279
i'm just uh

540
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,440
it's not the technology honestly all

541
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,119
excuses it's me dude i'm uh i just i'm

542
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
not the best interviewer like you could

543
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,079
send me questions and i'll have the list

544
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,519
of questions i just can't figure out how

545
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,519
to [ __ ] answer my better just having

546
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,400
a conversation but i don't know maybe i

547
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,480
just need to do that with the

548
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,200
interviewers uh i'll get good at it but

549
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,519
hopefully this 710 interview sparks my

550
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,080
inspiration to get some more people on

551
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,038

all of the medical procedures and stuff

675
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,558

and a half

679
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
like just hanging out with me i was it

680
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,399
was playmate like i was the the daycare

681
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
kids i was the teacher's aide like all

682
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
of it

683
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
like that [ __ ] had an impact like the

684
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,399
way

685
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
the world is directly

686
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
um framed by those two things yeah that

687
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,720
makes a huge difference yeah he's not

688
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,080
hanging out with a cartoon watching

689
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,319
booger picking kids he's hanging out

690
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,839
with dad all day long that's kind of

691
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,038
cool dude i see it i'm not trying to

692
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,279
talk i've been trying to make this the

693
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,119
fatherhood podcast but uh it was a good

694
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,558
opportunity to ask like when do we start

695
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,119
talking about our kids about smoking

696
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,319
herb like just because i like your uh

697
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,279
your your uh your model of parenting

698
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,119
we're very much um like my wife and i we

699
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,759
uh we sort of helped raise two of our

700
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,079
nieces already they're in their 20s now

701
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,720
um but we were

702
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,319
not parental but like parental adjacent

703
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,919
figures for them for their whole lives

704
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,480
and we just went with

705
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,480
brutal honesty was the whole point

706
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
like you have to put it in the context

707
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,599
that's age-appropriate

708
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
but

709
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,439
um

710
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,320
just we don't lie to him we just

711
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,519
we frame it appropriately and so it's

712
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,119
not daddy's outside doing dabs

713
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,879
his dad's taking personal time we're

714
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,479
going to give dad 15 or 20 minutes and

715
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
then

716
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,120
that'll line right about up with dinner

717
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
being ready and

718
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,919
all right let's roll right through it

719
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,480
we do the same thing with wine or

720
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,840
alcoholic beverages you know it's adult

721
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880

they don't like the smell of it they're

725
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,759
not interested in it or anything

726
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,840

740
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
somebody with weed and then you had to

741
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,599
have money to get weed and then you had

742
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,038
to buy the weed and pick all the [ __ ]

743
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,359
seeds out of it before you could smoke

744
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,278

749
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,278

750
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,439
if she spends some of her birthday money

751
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,919
on a bag of weed i don't care like

752
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,600
that's kind of how i feel about it like

753
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,320
part of me wishes

754
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,319
the

755
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,839
the current generation had to go through

756
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,599
some of the [ __ ] that we did when we

757
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,879
were teenagers to

758
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,480
acquire herb

759
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,760
and part of me is really glad they don't

760
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,200
have to

761
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,400
because like

762
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,880
yeah we got lucky kind of

763
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,278
yeah but it only got ugly and scary a

764
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,640
couple of times right i wouldn't want my

765
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,720
daughter messing with a couple of my

766
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,880
weed guys from back in the day oh yeah

767
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
right but like yeah i don't want my kids

768
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
driving three hours

769
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,399
because

770
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,240
that's where the weeds the best price

771
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
like the three hour drive is worth the

772
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,880
75 savings yeah now she goes to the

773
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,319
dispensary down the street and she's 18

774
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
and got a weed card so she can go in

775
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,359
there and get get plenty like all the

776
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
crap

777
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,719
like if there were rocks and stuff in

778
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,640
the pound like what was sprayed on it

779
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,319
yeah no i always troll her i'm like

780
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,240
you've never even picked seeds out of

781
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,519
weed like i always want to just like get

782
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,038
our weed and throw a bunch of seeds in

783
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,879
it like now dig that [ __ ] out of there

784
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,240
before you smoke see that's what it used

785
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,559
to be like

786
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
but she's ready to remember

787
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,519
smoking with somebody and they would

788
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,558
scissor stuff off a brick into a metal

789
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,440
colander and then grind on it with

790
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,918
like a pedestal from a mortar and pestle

791
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,320
oh yeah yeah nerves and so you'd have

792
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,278
the little colander and you just grind

793
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,639
around

794
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:25,119
this lump of compacted herb

795
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
yeah yep and then one day somebody

796
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,759
showed up with real weed and i was like

797
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,439
woody what do you have like this is kind

798
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,879
bud not compressed brick weave and i was

799
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,320
like well let's smoke that and my brain

800
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
went

801
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,558
yep and then it was everybody at the

802
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,038
party slept for seven hours yeah yeah

803
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,960
well then i had to learn where to get it

804
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,879
and then i had to learn how to grow it

805
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,558
and then i had to learn how to breed it

806
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,159
and that's bad too that's where we are

807
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,599
today yeah somebody showed up with some

808
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,760
really good weed and it blew my [ __ ]

809
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,119
brains

810
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,359
yeah so that was a weird segue from

811
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,959
asking when you're gonna uh talk about

812
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,639
cannabis with your kid i can't wait to

813
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,798
uh uh smoke a fat one with both of them

814
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,120
like i can't the time will come

815
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,200
a long way but like it's it's an event

816
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,359

829
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,960
he's super rad all right we've been

830
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,240
talking about kids a lot i don't

831
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,960
remember what i was rambling about i had

832
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,679
a segway it fell out of my brain

833
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,360
um parents is an excellent little sort

834
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,679
of little piece to show that we can do

835
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,839
when i'm on yeah it definitely is

836
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,559
because it's why you're never here so it

837
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,038
correlates very well like it's an

838
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,038
interesting balance that i think

839
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,038
i get it from older people in my family

840
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,319
that are like so how are you the pot guy

841
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:02,079
and like the good dad and it's like well

842
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,079
it's it's the you just said it

843
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,440
is it the kids like it's not complicated

844
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,359
grow rooms locked and secured and in

845
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
another place and the kids are

846
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,639
up there doing their thing it's like two

847
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,558
different yeah two different segments of

848
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,120
life

849
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:17,119
how do cops

850
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,940
yeah and it's like a gun safe but it's

851
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,019
cheaper

852
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,019
[Music]

865
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,558
you get a thing online called a gun

866
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,079
cabinet and like it's like a gun safe

867
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,240
but it's way lighter

868
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,639
and mine came perfect it's got a little

869
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,399
section for my little two foot bong and

870
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,278
it's got little shelves for my weed and

871
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,879
my hash and my gummies and it's got a

872
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,558
nice easy key system super simple right

873
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
that's perfect keep everything away from

874
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,558
the little ones that's all you got to do

875
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,398
in the house is not at all complicated

876
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,278
yeah yeah it's a big house and even if

877
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,639
it wasn't there's more than one room

878
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,000
yeah well that's

879
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
it's one of those things like when

880
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,519
you're thinking about laws is you gotta

881
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,199
have a place to go smoke if you're in an

882
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,038
apartment like

883
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,278
and that was how i got people to make it

884
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,398
legal to smoke on porches down here as i

885
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,079
just pointed out like what about

886
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,678
apartment smokers

887
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,119
you really want parents sitting and

888
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,960
stuck in an apartment because that's

889
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,839
where it's only legal to smoke like let

890
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,600
the parent go outside very true yeah let

891
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,119
the parent go outside let's

892
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,678
immediately change that in the law

893
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,759
before we pass it

894
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,640
uh did you hear the grateful dog episode

895

922
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,038
like there was a line in the episode

923
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,278
where you talk about uh rolling up

924
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,798
joints before going to red rocks

925
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,640
for ray guy on the rocks and i

926
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,359

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,640
kitchen table grinding herb for utero

928
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,398
joints with

929
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,240
knowing that you were going to reggae on

930
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,719
the rocks and me not at all being

931
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,919
interested in ray guy on the rocks but

932
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,519
we were hanging out smoking and

933
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,399
recording that night so i'm sitting

934

937
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,038
yeah we used to uh i remember the easy

938
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,359
cloner showing up and you hit that part

939
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,200
in that episode too like yeah all those

940
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,199
fun little evolutions i was there for

941
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,038
just a fun episode to hear cool plus the

942
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,360
grateful dogs still my favorite of your

943
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,519
genetics i'm glad you said that before i

944
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,719
had to ask you if it was your favorite i

945
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,798
love hearing that that's your favorite

946
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,919
mad there's not a grateful dog shirt

947
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,000
like

948
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,600
i don't know what that shirt would be

949
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,919
but it would be a picture of jerry

950
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,439
garcia and david grissman because it's a

951
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,360
band name so

952
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,840
i can't really make my own shirt of a

953
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,439
banana it's my favorite shirt

954
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,558
or my favorite strange shirt i don't

955
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,558
want to wear

956
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,639
yeah well i can't do it i can't make it

957
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,798
because i probably get sued by whoever

958
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
owns the grateful dead stuff

959
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,679

960
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,278
david grissman's stuff yeah

961
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,519
but if anybody out there wants to make a

962
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,519
bootleg grateful dog shirt i wear an

963
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,599
extra large and mike's probably into a

964
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,359

965
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,759

going on in congress they were going to

1144
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:02,159
give legal cannabis access to banking

1145
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,599
some people were all for it others are

1146
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,598
against it um even in the community

1147
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,039
there's there's word resistance because

1148
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,240
everybody's afraid of the corporate

1149
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,800
takeover

1150
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,199
which will be hastened by full access to

1151
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
banking but that failed again which is

1152
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,358
disappointing the community's still so

1153
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,440
fragmented that

1154
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,440
they can kick our issues down the down

1155
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,240
the street for decades and nothing

1156
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
happens fear of the bank being able to

1157
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,078
be involved is what is keeping your

1158
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,838
business afloat your business plan is

1159
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,119
wrong you got to re-strategize if that's

1160
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,279
what's worrying you realize your

1161
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,480
argument for not being able to use the

1162
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,800
banks uh that's that's a uh it's a

1163
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,800
insecurity that's a weird fear

1164
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,640
that's a poorly planned before you can

1165
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,359
fix that like it's

1166
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,719
yeah a a major

1167
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,319
kind of

1168
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,000
i don't know stumbling block in legal

1169
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,280
cannabis right now is an access to

1170
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,358
capital

1171
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,519
um we can't go to the bank and get a

1172
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,000
business loan you have to know somebody

1173
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,400
with private capital or you have to have

1174
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,880
um private investment and it's just a

1175
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,720
brutal system to survive

1176
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,519
i mean it's cut throat it's why owners

1177
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,039
are

1178
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,280
so

1179
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,719
stereotypically douche baggy

1180
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,200
like it's

1181
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,199
it's that's who's who's funding it right

1182
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,759
now it's not somebody trying to pay off

1183
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,759
a business loan over 40 years it's right

1184
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,839
somebody looking to to triple their

1185
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,960
investment quick and get out of the new

1186
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,119
hot thing

1187
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,639
that explains a lot of a thing that i

1188
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,160
talk about on this show often um

1189
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,759
the commercial industry can beat the

1190
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,039
[ __ ] out of a grower with passion

1191
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,640
because

1192
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,480
i became a lead grower and this has

1193
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,239
happened in more than one environment

1194
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
and once you're in the commercial

1195
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,439
industry you realize it's kind of a joke

1196
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,679
it's kind of a trend

1197
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,240
there's an owner who

1198
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,039
has finagled some money out of somebody

1199
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,439
some people a group a person with money

1200
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,199
he's gotten an owner has investors maybe

1201
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,200
multiple investors

1202
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,439
then the owner has

1203
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,598
probably two investors then they've got

1204
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,119
a lead grower and a grow team and

1205
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
they're telling different stories to

1206
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,800
everybody because that investor every

1207
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,400
day wants their money back the growers

1208
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,839
telling them i need nine weeks to get it

1209
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
done they're telling the grower that

1210
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,279
they're gonna they're just so it's that

1211
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,039
pressure from that investor that's all

1212
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,240
of a sudden their weirdness

1213
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,159
all of a sudden they're asking the

1214
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,919
grower if they can shorten the flowering

1215
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,679
time to six weeks and it's like that's

1216
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,119
not how [ __ ] nature works yeah they

1217
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,960
tell the investor will have it done in

1218
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
eight weeks the grower says nine they

1219
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,400
tell me i gotta have it done in seven

1220
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,079
when it doesn't reach the harvest goals

1221
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,760
because we took it down two weeks early

1222
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,800
because the [ __ ] owner of the place

1223
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,079
was getting uh ridiculously overzealous

1224
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,920
it doesn't reach the goals or the

1225
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,359
potency then the investor gets mad about

1226
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,440
us not making the money we should have

1227
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,759
made like it's a weird dynamic if we

1228
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,559
could get those real bank loans uh and

1229
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
have

1230
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,279
people like

1231
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,359
different everything would be different

1232
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
with a decent [ __ ] apr and actually

1233
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,159
just get a loan know that we got to pay

1234
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,000
this back over this time because we have

1235
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,679
to sell this much product that means our

1236
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,199
first year we could struggle by year two

1237
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,279
and three we could be going by year five

1238
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,559
we're banging by ten we're all paid off

1239
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,400
like you can make that kind of plan but

1240
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,159
when you got crazy investors

1241
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
uh it goes kind of weird sometimes you

1242
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,000
don't get to do all the things that you

1243
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,079
were hoping um sometimes they dangle

1244
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,119
more money over you they're like oh

1245
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,560
we'll give you more money after your

1246
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,760
first harvest and you harvest and they

1247
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,759
don't give it to you and you've promised

1248
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,119
people bonuses and then there's no

1249
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,400
bonuses to be given because you didn't

1250
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,000
get the money

1251
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,680
anyway that's everything's so tight

1252
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,519
because it's all private capital and

1253
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,960
it's just it's just one of the one more

1254
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,759
thing that's

1255
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,199
it's

1256
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,240
how many different things we have to

1257
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,159
overcome

1258
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,078
yeah right and there's so many of us

1259
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,399
it's it's one in three americans so

1260
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,160
there's 120 million of us

1261
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,119
and if we could all just get together

1262
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:41,279
for 45 minutes on one wednesday

1263
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,280
everything would be different you know

1264
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,119
it's just the random stoner thought of

1265
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,040
the night i like it no that's what i

1266
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,559
gave you this uh this mike's moments

1267
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,079
this open platform that's what it was

1268
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,318
for uh any of the people that don't like

1269
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,839
listening to the politics uh they got to

1270
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,838
listen to a good 30-minute show and then

1271
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,039
they can uh not uh not hear this part if

1272
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:58,559
they're not into it and we don't have to

1273
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,639
listen to their comments

1274
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,119
yeah they need to start

1275
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,039
like everybody gets down on politics but

1276
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
it's like how everything functions like

1277
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,800
i was just scanning headlines and i

1278
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,879
don't have the time right now that i

1279
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,079
used to have to really keep up on like

1280
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,519
every state's path through legalization

1281
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,760
but i saw that new york just had a whole

1282
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,358
bunch of counties or i think they call

1283
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,920
them counties in new york

1284
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,598
a whole bunch of geographical squares of

1285
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,200
space uh

1286
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,960
borderlines opt out or refuse to opt in

1287
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,719
to legal cannabis so they're gonna be

1288
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,358
like colorado where

1289
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,679
you can buy urban in manitoba but not

1290
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,920
colorado springs or you can get urban

1291
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,159
pueblo but not in

1292
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,039
um wallsenberg i think you can get wheat

1293
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,118
in wasselberg but yeah

1294
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,880
60 some counties in colorado where you

1295
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,720
still can't buy herb you've got to drive

1296
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
to the next county over

1297
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,118
in some counties it's made ridiculously

1298
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
rich because it's a small county next to

1299
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,720
a big county

1300
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,318
and the big counties refuse to opt in so

1301
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,559
the little county's never seen more

1302
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,920
funding like trinidad

1303
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,920
yeah um

1304
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,318
but uh

1305
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,480
if you're not involved especially at the

1306
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:11,759
local level like just weird stuff

1307
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,559
happens

1308
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,079
and

1309
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,679
you don't want to miss out on this you

1310
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,680
know especially if you only go to the

1311
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,879
dispensary a couple of times a year you

1312
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,279
don't want to have to drive three

1313
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,720
counties over right and pay ridiculous

1314
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,319
taxes

1315
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,399
plenty of people drive to another county

1316
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,920
just to avoid 30 32 35 taxes on cannabis

1317
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,960
when you're buying a product that costs

1318
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,559
200 bucks that's 60 bucks in taxes if

1319
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960
you didn't have to pay that imagine how

1320
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,480
much more product you could leave with

1321
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,400
it uh

1322
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,079
the taxes right now are incredibly

1323
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,800
brutal because it's still illegal

1324
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,280
federally so federal tax rule 280e

1325
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
applies and you can't deduct

1326
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,240
all the normal expenses from your

1327
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,599
business taxes

1328
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,439
like that's where the industry's health

1329
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,119
insurance is right there

1330
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
oh yeah that's the health insurance

1331
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,200
money that's the bonus money that's the

1332
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
raises money

1333
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,559
it's

1334
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,078
just one of those things

1335
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,759
i still love legal cannabis i wouldn't

1336
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,440
go back for anything

1337
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,920
like i laugh at people pretending that

1338
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,079
they'd go back to illegal herb oh no we

1339
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,720
don't know if you were a home grower

1340
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,000
back then like everybody else is way

1341
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,598
better off and then you should have

1342
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,760
evolved by now you should be leading a

1343
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,680
dispensary or at least being a top-notch

1344
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
grower at a dispensary or a consultant

1345
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,838
he should have evolved and adjusted and

1346
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,280
adapted because those times are changing

1347
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:28,880
uh maybe that's a good heads up to

1348
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,640
people who are in

1349
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,240
markets which are about to change or

1350
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,679
have recently changed bro if you're an

1351
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,000
illegal grower and you're just doing the

1352
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,838
black market thing there will always be

1353
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,599
a demand and a need for the free market

1354
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,358
but a lot of those are going to go away

1355
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,480
you may want to re-strategize you may

1356
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,880
want to come up with something new

1357
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,880
because eventually a lot of those gray

1358
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,519
market free market opportunities those

1359
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,079
disappear when the legal market comes so

1360
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,318
be ready yeah and then the squeeze comes

1361
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,000
quick i mean i remember and it doesn't

1362
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,079
seem like that long ago but like me and

1363
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,599
jeff said earlier we're old now

1364
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,039
older now

1365
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,640
um

1366
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,480
you used to be able to make a perfectly

1367
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,679
respectable living with four or five

1368
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,679
lights

1369
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,159
three or four lights even

1370
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,799
if you ran a tight ship you could have

1371
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,598
three or four grow lights in a house

1372
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,599
and to have a

1373
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,880
set of regular customers and make a

1374
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,960
perfectly respectable living oh yeah and

1375
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,358
that went away about an hour and a half

1376
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,358
after legalization landed

1377
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,519
and you started to see

1378
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,880
do you remember all the people who

1379
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,239
tried to make a dispensary in their

1380
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,000
living room oh yeah nailed shelves to

1381
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,519
the wall and had jars up and yeah

1382
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,280

1399
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,440
of homework so mike we were talking

1400
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,119
about some greedy people uh in my

1401
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,880
opinion it would just be greedy people

1402
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,559
would be the people that did not want

1403
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,680
legalization to happen i would never

1404
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:24,318
undo legalization people in jail for

1405
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,838
cannabis is like [ __ ] that that is

1406
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,559
that's a word that we're not supposed to

1407
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:28,078
say

1408
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,838
yes yeah there's a word we're not

1409
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,359
supposed to say anymore in this time

1410
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,159
time of the year and this climate and

1411
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,358
this culture is how i feel about that um

1412
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,358
yeah people should be able to consume

1413
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,199
cannabis and not have fear of getting

1414
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,559
locked up just for smoking a plant

1415
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,838
people can do we should be able to do

1416
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,519
most of whatever we want if it doesn't

1417
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:45,358
bug anybody so i'd never undo that

1418
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,759
that's not something i would change i

1419
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,078
changed a lot of my uh a lot of my world

1420

1422
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,200

1423
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,800
it made me grow it made me grow

1424
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,759
business-wise in a lot of ways made me

1425
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,760
grow commercially but it made me grow uh

1426
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,839
as an adult as a person as a business

1427
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,280

gonna do what was i gonna do just sell

1429
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,119
weed forever grow weed and sell weed

1430
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
forever i had to evolve and move with

1431
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,119
the times i couldn't just have a that

1432
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,880
couldn't be my hustle forever i had to

1433
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,559
learn other things and evolve yeah at a

1434
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,800
certain point that would have gotten

1435
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,960
really old yeah

1436
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,640
um i was tired when it was ending i was

1437
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,159
done with it when it that's why it yeah

1438
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,318
that's why we evolved it by the time it

1439
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,838
went away yeah

1440
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,880
watching all the different different

1441
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,318

looking and sounding great the the

1477
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,480
investments you're making in the tech

1478

are paying off the

1479
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,960
hours you spent learning to edit the

1480
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,799

1481

i'm digging the music in and out but i

1482
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,960

like uh the mystic roots song yeah i

1484
