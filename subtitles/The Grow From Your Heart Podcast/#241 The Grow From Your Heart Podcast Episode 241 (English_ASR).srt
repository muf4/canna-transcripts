22

Oh ladies and gentlemen I'm starting off

23
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,799
the podcast with the throat thing

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,620
already I apologize I'm gonna blame it

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,878
on all of the flour I've been smoking

26
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,049
that's right if you know me and if you

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,300
listen to the podcast a lot you know

28
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,129
that I don't smoke a lot of flowers we

29
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,929
call weed the buds that's known as

30
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,280
flowers in the cannabis industry if

31
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,030
you're in Colorado or a legal state

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,070
that's the flower

33
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,329
I don't smoke a lot of flower I like to

34
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,579
smoke a lot of concentrates I like to

35
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,709
take a lot of dabs but last weekend I

36
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,329
went to see fish and it's hard to sneak

37
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,529
a dab rag into a concert but you can

38
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,239
sneak a whole bunch in joints and a

39
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,799
whole bunch of weed into a concert so

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,149
I've been smoking a lot of flowers it's

41
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,950
been a little bit more convenient than

42
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:33,950
taking a DAB all the time but you can

43
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,629
hear what it's doing to my throat I do

44
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,049
apologize for that big shot up to this

45
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:41,719
lemon og haze I was bred by the ethos

46
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,030
collective ethos seeds mr. Kollin and

47
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,159
then I grew it at Three Rivers and then

48
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,929
I bought it as a just a patient over the

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,219
counter and I smoked a whole bunch of it

50
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,439
this weekend it was freakin delicious

51
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,539
also smoked a bunch of the true cush

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
what else did I have I had some bordello

53
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:57,320
and some blueberry headband they were

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,519
all quite delicious the bordello was a

55
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,189
little more mellow than what I would

56
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,789
have preferred but the flavor was on

57
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,868
point so once again I apologize for all

58
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,159
the throat clearing that you will hear

59
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,959
during this episode hopefully it fades

60
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,758
away once I start talking a lot I'll get

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,229
my voice going it will fade away I've

62
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,059
also got some water here I've also got

63
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:16,519
some frosty cold dr. pepper I'll keep

64
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,439
myself caffeinated and hydrated and I

65
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,239
will deliver the best show I could bring

66
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,250
you all right I've already been talking

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,659
about sea and fish last weekend holy

68
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,340
crap you guys if you know anything about

69
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,870
me you know that fish is my favorite

70
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,950
band on the planet it was up for debate

71
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,289
for a minute there it might have been

72
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,359
fish with a Grateful Dead for a moment

73
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,179
it may have been a band called mo but

74
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,319
you know what fish is my favorite band

75
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,510
one thing I've noticed you guys is I

76
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,429
don't I don't know any of the new [ __ ] I

77
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:42,500
don't know half of the songs that fish

78
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,580
plays anymore I miss the old stuff I

79
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,020
like the stuff when they wrote long

80
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,480
elaborate songs with a lot of great

81
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,770
changes now it's kind of straightforward

82
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,369
for for rock and roll stuff which I'm

83
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,469
not mad about

84
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,390
they had who don't want to work to write

85
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:55,639
all those other long songs but a lot of

86
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:57,079
the new stuff isn't for me I still had a

87
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,049
great time

88
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,840
fish did fish with the pH I did three

89
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,090
nights at Dick's Sporting Goods

90
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,170
it's the Dick's Sporting Goods field or

91
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,128
something like that no no it's a giant

92
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:10,539
soccer field in Denver

93
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:12,548
it holds a lot of dim people this place

94
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,489
was huge and they did three nights in a

95
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,409
row they did Friday Saturday and Sunday

96
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,878
man the concerts were great I went with

97
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:20,378

98
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,810

99
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,280
hotel we went saw fish the first night

100
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,628

101
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,609
not gonna read you the entire set list

102
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:29,889
one of my favorite fish songs of all

103
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:32,170
time has always been tube I've seen them

104
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,568
play tube a couple of times live I got a

105
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,280
really cool version of tube the first

106
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:38,199
night of the Phish concert that's always

107
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,489
awesome of course if you know me you

108
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,988
know that I love Harry hood it's a

109
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,730
reggae style Phish song they played

110
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,908
Harry hood and then they played Harry

111
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,259
hood into cavern cavern the old stuff is

112
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:49,030
my favorite so of course I'm mentioning

113
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,500
the old songs cavern is off of one of

114
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,109
their first couple albums if they put

115
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,609
out off of a picture of nectar it's the

116
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,010
one with the quote whatever you do take

117
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,230
care of your shoes that was a great show

118
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,298
super happy with that Bayon chord with

119
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,619
the horse and to silent in the morning

120
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,840
into character zero

121
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,950
I heard them play a little note they do

122
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,269
those little teaser notes when a

123
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,548
musician picks up his guitar he's gonna

124
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,810
play a song you'd put your pedals to

125
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,069
your effects pedals are on the right

126
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,060
thing and then do a little noodling to

127
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,009
make sure it sounds right and then you

128
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,598
play the song I can tell by their pre

129
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,858
noodling what song it was gonna be when

130
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,899
it was the horse into silent in the

131
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,098
morning that's always fun calm that calm

132
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,959
the songs before they play them the

133
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:25,538
Encore was the horse silent in the

134
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,769
morning into character zero that was the

135
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,969
first night that was pretty awesome the

136
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,019
second night now I'm gonna go quickly

137
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,880
here with my favorites out of the

138
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,870
setlist the people that are fish fans

139
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,699
they listen to the show will appreciate

140
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,918
it the rest of you will just get to hear

141
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,150
some of my favorite songs on the second

142
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,228
night they started the show it's simple

143
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,969
I always thought that was cool

144
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:41,379
then they went into a song that I I'm

145
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,520
gonna admit it I don't know if I've ever

146
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,319
[ __ ] heard it before it was called

147
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,759
Martian monster don't know if I ever

148
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,560
heard that that might have been my first

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,908
time ever hearing that song like I said

150
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,579
I don't know any of the new fish stuff

151
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:53,288
anything after round room I am pretty

152
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,029
lost and before I don't even know a lot

153
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:57,158
of round room that's where they kind of

154
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:59,379
lost me I like I love that old [ __ ] I go

155
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:01,300
to see the jams and the old [ __ ] and I

156
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,610
go to see the build-up and then when

157
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,348
tray hits that [ __ ] pinnacle Note one

158
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,150
if you're a fish fan you know what I

159
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,069
mean he just goes to this place that's

160
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,388
what I go for I want to see that so the

161
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,668
second night they open was simple and a

162
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,629
Martian monster then then they did it to

163
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:16,689
me ladies you know when they played

164
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,759

pretty cool seats I don't buy the field

191
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,829
seats I don't get down on the field

192
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,290
right in the front just gets a little

193
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,029
too crowded it's a little too much a lot

194
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,830
of people are all [ __ ] up on drugs and

195
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,059
they're not super polite and it's not

196
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,019
that they're rude they're just [ __ ]

197
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,160
high out of their minds and they're not

198
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,569
paying attention that they're in your

199
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,189
space and spilling their drink on you

200
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,019
and stepping on your toes and I got a

201
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:25,819
pretty girl with me and I don't need to

202
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:29,060
deal with all that [ __ ] so we we chose

203
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:31,459
to sit in the stands and Sean happened

204
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,530
to be about two rows back from the

205
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:35,418
stands and he him and Caroline saved us

206
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,159
some seats so we got to eat some vegan

207
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,689
nachos in the parking lot and then we

208
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,340
headed into the fish show for the second

209
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,689
night that was great the first night we

210
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,149
just kind of floated around in the back

211
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:45,199
in the back of dicks there's an area or

212
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,279
you can just kind of stand there and

213
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,959
dance and there's not a lot of people

214
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,459
around it's not real crowded I enjoyed

215
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,349
that so I could get down and just shake

216
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,459
my dreads and swing my arms around and

217
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,840
be a silly hippie for a little while

218
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,609
when you're 65 and your arms are super

219
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,899
long you just feel like always bumping

220
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,009
into people at a concert so it's kind of

221
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,509
nice just to be in the back of the

222
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,189
second night we were kind of in the

223
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,538
crowd and then three quarters of the way

224
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,430
through the people to the right of me

225
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:06,110
decided they'd had enough they were a

226
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,699
little older than myself and they just

227
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,319
dipped out they took off so I had a lot

228
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,639
of space to the right side of me and I

229
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,689
stepped over and gave some other people

230
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,728
some room but that was pretty cool so

231
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,860
we'll keep going to the third night they

232
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:17,779
opened with a song not sure I'd ever

233
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,379
heard Buffalo Bill I'm sure I've heard

234
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,699
it somewhere

235
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,589
didn't sound really familiar but I knew

236
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,839
the words that was weird the moment

237
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:26,388
dance birds of a feather a couple things

238
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,009
that I'm not familiar with back on the

239
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,098
train which is always cool the wedge was

240
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,719
[ __ ] nice 46 days was not my thing it

241
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:34,599

242
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,130

243
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,629
awesome then set to down with disease

244
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:42,040

246
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,270

247
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,740
2001 opossum Suzie Greenberg Jenny

248
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,969
wanted to hear Suzy Greenberg all

249
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,410

250
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,210
Greenberg I wanna hear Suzy Greenberg

251
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,620
[ __ ] three songs up from the whole

252
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,789
concert she heard Suzy Greenberg so they

253
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,920
wrap up the second set with Suzy

254
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,840
Greenberg come out do an encore of waste

255
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,490
into first tube so that was Owen I kept

256
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,319
mentioning to Jenny I said they did not

257
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,579
finish down with disease because it was

258
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,079
more of down with disease that they

259
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,879
didn't finish there's a whole nother

260
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,379
verse and here I'm looking at the notes

261
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,399
to the setlist and it says on finished

262
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,529
so I didn't mention that the third night

263
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,149
Jenny and I were kind of debating on

264
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,739
where to sit because it's a huge venue

265
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,969
and she kind of wanted to have a seat

266
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,400
because she got pretty burnt out tired

267
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,800
over the weekend and it's it's just

268
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,179
convenient to have a seat and I was like

269
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,620
it was crowded and I didn't really want

270
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,090
to invade anybody space cuz it was a

271
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,620
little later when we got in Sunday night

272
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,750
and most of the good seats were taken

273
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,399
and I was okay with just dancing like a

274
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,809
hippie in the aisles and shoes what I do

275
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,340
and especially at dicks they got that

276
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,309
big hole ring area around there that you

277
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,719
could just chill in so I was like how

278
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,309
about we just go smoke a couple of

279
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,690
joints off to the sides there's some

280
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,039
seats down by the stage that you can't

281
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,080
really see the stage but you can hear

282
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:51,519
the music it sounded [ __ ] great we

283
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,110
smoked a joint during the opener during

284
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,460
down with disease and then we went up to

285
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,720
the top and just walked around and

286
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,310
started at the top and worked our way

287
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,620
almost all the way around the bowl and

288
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,059
then just worked our way back we went to

289
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,980
one end and smoked the joint went to the

290
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,809
other end and smoked a joint and we just

291
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,310
walked around the whole third or the

292
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,289
whole third night and just went and

293
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,669
grabbed seats during the break or when

294
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,079
we wanted to go sneak away and smoke a

295
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,399
joint or something so we just walked

296
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,290
around mostly and that was kind of cool

297
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,090
because we got to see a lot of different

298
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,500
weirdos the fish shows are filled with

299
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,850
weirdos and we also got to see the

300
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,679
concert from a lot of different angles

301
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,360
and then I got to walk around and enjoy

302
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,219
it the way I wanted to and then Jenny

303
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,690
also got to have a seat and rest her her

304
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,420
bones her knee was getting a little sore

305
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,130
which is understandable but anyway that

306
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,990
was our seating arrangement on the third

307
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:34,059

327
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,639
assume I don't completely remember yeah

328
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,079
I think it was a third night cuz we're

329
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,549
way off to the left over there getting a

330
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,629
lemonade had to be the third night

331
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,889
because that's where we kept smoking

332
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,939
joints was in that one seat over there

333
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:26,379
um yeah they didn't had so much so many

334
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,300
joints on me and they didn't even search

335
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:29,799
me to find one of them had joints in

336
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,419
every pocket was [ __ ] awesome as

337
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,740
rolling joints and filling them with wax

338
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:34,629
and filling them with butter with

339
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,500
batters with hashes was [ __ ] awesome

340
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:39,429
but anyway the third night I was in line

341
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,409
for a lemonade the non-alcoholic

342
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:43,299
lemonade they cost six dollars and fifty

343
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,009
cents it's basically a cup of ice water

344
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,349
they drop a [ __ ] lemon in it charge

345
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,919
you 650 whatever it was delicious it was

346
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,399
refreshing but I met a lovely young lady

347
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,929
who at first I wrote down Ashley and

348
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,089
then I second-guess myself in her set

349
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,979
and said her name is Amber I'm gonna go

350
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:03,100
with my first intuition and say that I

351
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,420
met a lady named Ashley but I don't want

352
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,670
to be wrong so that feels [ __ ] rude

353
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:09,099
so I apologize I'm pretty sure was

354
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,539
Ashley or amber it was a Phish concert

355
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,790
by the way and I did just get done

356
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,838
smoking age I can't take joint that's

357
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,250
why I was getting lemonade so I

358
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,769
apologize if I got your name wrong but

359
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,049
she recognized me she didn't recognize

360
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,448
me she's never seen me before she I was

361
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:24,188
wearing an IRA genetics t-shirt and I'm

362
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,240
a tall white guy with dreadlocks and

363
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,769
I've talked about it on the podcast

364
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,198
before and I've talked about being it

365
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,850
fish and she just turned around and she

366
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:33,068
said hey I don't mean to be weird but

367
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,720
are you Rasta Jeff from the podcast I

368
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,610
was like it's totally me and she

369
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,230
introduced herself and obviously as too

370
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,528
[ __ ] high to pay proper attention and

371
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,659
did my best I've got some ATD but she's

372
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:45,519
from she's from the East Coast and she's

373
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:47,708
trying to grow on the East Coast and she

374
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,870
had some questions about how to mimic

375
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,758
barometric pressure because she's

376
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,139
struggling with pressure and moisture

377
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,300
issues because everything is so

378
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,209
different from growing out there to here

379
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,859
and her teacher has left her she is not

380
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,058
with her teacher anymore her teacher has

381
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,859
moved to Colorado so she's

382
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:04,358
juggling to figure out some stuff so if

383
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,699
anybody's got any tips on how to mimic

384
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:08,019
barometric pressure I would love to hear

385
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:09,698
about that because I have no idea how to

386
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,499
do that but I had a great conversation

387
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:12,698
with her we hung out in line for a few

388
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,989
minutes until it was her turn to order

389
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,338
her drink and then my turn to order my

390
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:16,719
drink and of course miss Jenny Beth came

391
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,779
from the came back from using the

392
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,769
restroom so I got to introduce her also

393
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,629
it was funny cuz we were standing in

394
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,158
line trying to talk and for some reason

395
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:28,239
people decided that the space between

396
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:30,458
her and I between Ashley / amber / my

397
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:32,229
new friend they decided that the space

398
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,638
between us was the new walkway and we

399
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,899
were trying to talk politely and have a

400
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,399
conversation if people just kept [ __ ]

401
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,089
passing through like we didn't exist it

402
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,278
was really funny

403
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,449
I found it entertaining but she had some

404
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,859
great questions and it was really great

405
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,808
meeting somebody at a Phish concert

406
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:45,429
there were thousands of people there I

407
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:46,899
don't know how many I'm gonna say 10,000

408
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:49,149
people there and this young lady

409
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,619
recognized me and was polite enough to

410
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,719
say hi and I think that that's really

411
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:54,609
cool so that made my day it was really

412
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,769
fun getting a compliment and meeting a

413
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:59,168

414

422
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:14,079
brain said at first then I was like no

423

435
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,229
concert Sunday the lovely Jenny Beth and

436
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:40,629
I headed back to the hotel and slept

437
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:43,239
like [ __ ] babies we were worn out

438
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,009
from a long fish weekend we had a ton of

439
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,798
fun we were exhausted from running

440
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,329
around on the Sun and dancing all night

441
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:50,978
we woke up we got cleaned up packed up

442
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,218
from the hotel and we headed to a

443
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:55,509
restaurant known as Sam's number three

444
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:58,629
delicious little [ __ ] eat spot right

445
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:00,938
there that was tasty it's marvelous I'd

446
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,188
recommend that we wouldn't hung out at

447
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:04,598
the guitar Center in Denver for a few

448
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,918
minutes there too the one on Colorado

449
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,479
just went and beat around on some

450
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:08,558
electronic drums for a few minutes

451
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,239
there's had some time to kill and we

452
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:12,009
were right near that area so just went

453
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:14,080
knocked around on some drums and then we

454
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,590
headed over to comedy

455
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,389
works where I got dad the Fuuka I got

456

457
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,559
blazed as well and we went to comedy

458
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,330
works and we saw mr. Doug Benson

459
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,769

460
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,870

463
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,730

464
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,290
few guests and they play some games on

465
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,149
stage and people went prizes and things

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,210
contaminate your thought process when

489
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:31,000
you see him or listen to him but it's if

490
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,920
if Ari Shaffir and Marc Maron made a

491
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,690
baby it would be Jacob Seraph that's

492
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,709
kinda that's kind of what I thought when

493
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,760
I met him ah

494
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,710
so I went saw Doug Benson on the way to

495
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,409
see Doug Benson I decided to listen to

496
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,730
the Doug loves minis podcast a few

497
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,039
minutes into the podcast he's like

498
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,320
Denver I'm coming to see Denver oh no no

499
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,259
he actually read my iTunes review and

500
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,850
Doug Benson said take a phat dab and

501
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,500
give your mom a hug for me at the end of

502
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,029
my iTunes review because I was smart

503
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,399
enough to type that in there and he

504
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,199
reads the iTunes reviews on his show but

505
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,299
then after he read my iTunes review he's

506
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,470
like Rasta Jeff I'm going to Denver and

507
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,819
I look forward to seeing Ross and Jeff

508
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,769
he comes to all the shows so that'll be

509
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,930
fun to see him there he totally gave me

510
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,500
like a longshot on his podcast that was

511
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,529
super cool

512
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,080
then we're at Comedy Works at the show

513
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,179
and Doug Benson reads tweets if you

514
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,060
tweet him before the show he will read

515
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:25,750
your tweet possibly during the opening

516
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:27,458
part of the show so he read my tweet and

517
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,649
of course I said

518
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,268
Doug Benson I'm getting I don't remember

519
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,889
the words I used I don't have my Twitter

520
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:35,799
open right now but I said I'm getting

521
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:38,230
lit up on dabs and dr. pepper before the

522
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,878
show and he read he asked me he goes

523
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,928
Ross to Jeff's here where's Ross to Jeff

524
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,730
and I was like whoohoo I'm right here

525
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:44,708
he's like what's up dude how many shows

526
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,178
have you been to and I couldn't think of

527
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:49,088
how many Doug Benson shows I've actually

528
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:51,220
been to I said about 10 but honestly I

529
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,829
said more than 10 honestly I think I've

530
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,350
been to closer to 20 Doug Benson

531
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:58,778
performances all of which were at Comedy

532
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,100
Works so he read my tweet he asked me

533
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:02,259
some questions he told me thanks for

534
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,838
coming he said it was our 10th

535
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:07,088
anniversary which means the gift is

536
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,980
paper and then he said I'm sure Rasta

537
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:10,509
jeff has something wrapped in paper and

538
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,909
then he laughed and he said I look

539
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:14,048
forward to seeing you outside dude

540
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:15,339
because he meant in the alley where we

541
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,990
smoke and then he goes I'm gonna give

542
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,038
you a [ __ ] he can't believe so Doug

543
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,509
Benson told me he was gonna give me a

544
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,588
[ __ ] and they need to started

545
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:22,028
laughing and then he said no I'll see

546
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,678
you out in the alley after you show and

547
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:25,778
then he said me and all my friends are

548
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,490
gonna jump you and wash your hair which

549
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,339
was slightly offensive but completely

550
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,990
funny and then of course miss Jenny Beth

551
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:33,879
tweeted at Doug Benson also so right

552
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,960
after that he said where's miss and I'm

553
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,700
not gonna say her twitter handle cuz I

554
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,288
don't know if she wants it advertised

555
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,940
like that I'm gonna be respectful sorry

556
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:41,169
but if you wanted me to say it I'll say

557
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,130
it on another show but she did not I

558
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,179
don't know if she wants or shouldn't

559
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,039
give me permission or anything please

560
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:47,288
Doug Benson's like so where's this

561
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,460
person and she's like I'm right here she

562
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,140
was pretty embarrassed and then he read

563
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,970
her tweet which was something about

564
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,710
seeing Doug Benson after a great weekend

565
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,149
thanks babe and she was saying thanks

566
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,798
made to me cuz she tagged me in the post

567
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,089
but Doug Benson was like so is that for

568
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,369
me babe and I thought it was pretty

569
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,259
funny so we both got our tweets read by

570
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:04,569
Doug Benson

571
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:08,200
during his recording Doug Benson

572
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:11,470
revealed that the show at Comedy Works

573
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,409
was being recorded for his next comedy

574
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,929
album that he will release on iTunes so

575
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,460
there is a good chance that myself and

576
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,559
the always lovely always beautiful

577
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,590
always charming miss Jenny Beth will be

578
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,538
on Doug Benson's new recording because

579
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:28,119
his new thing that he's doing he just

580
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,740
records the entire show and then puts it

581
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,500
out like a bootleg style like how fish

582
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,399
used to do and the name of the show will

583
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,269
be the date which was I believe

584
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:38,619
September 4th it'll be 9 / 4 / 17 Denver

585
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:39,519
Colorado will be the name of the album

586
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,409
so

587
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,029
I hope he puts it out because I mean I

588
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,710
got a lot of [ __ ] interaction and it

589
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:48,009
would be really cool to get to listen

590
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,509
back to that I had a good time so the

591
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,190
live album should come out hopefully

592
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,319
that happens I want to give a huge shout

593
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,210
out even if the album doesn't come out I

594
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,529
always have a good time when Doug Benson

595
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,970
comes only give a huge shout out to Doug

596
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,579

597
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,680

598

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,839
onna shift gears to talk about something

675
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,210
a little bit more serious I can't use

676
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,819
any names because of I don't have

677
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,990
permission and I try to be respectful

678
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,629
but I had something weird happened while

679
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,609
I was at work the other day one of my

680
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm the boss and it sounds weird to say

681
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:55,629
employees one of my employees and that's

682
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,459
how it goes I it just doesn't feel right

683
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,110
cuz he's my friend also and I don't like

684
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,419
power trip and being the boss he's equal

685
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,859
to me I've just got the title of I get

686
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,890
the [ __ ] to-do list and spread it out

687
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:10,209
and he does the [ __ ] but anyhow one of

688
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,580
my employees applied pesticides and he

689
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,350
assured me that he used all of the

690
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:16,298
proper protective equipment and that he

691
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,648
took all of the proper safety procedures

692
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:19,808
and steps and that he followed the

693
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:21,308
standard operation procedure to a tee

694
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:24,250
which I know he does because he's a

695
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:27,009
great employee he's dedicated he's smart

696
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,808
he's aware and he's just that guy and

697
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,730
he's also been worker protection safety

698
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:32,109
trained so I know what he's doing or I

699
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,210
know that he knows what he's doing and

700
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,069
he knows the risks involved with what

701
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,980
he's doing

702
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:41,439
so my employee applied a pesticide to a

703
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,909
room he actually applied you guys you

704
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
can mix pesticides if they're compatible

705
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:47,980
you don't have to spray one thing at a

706
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,009
time you can put like evergreen and

707
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,599
maybe I don't want to tell you too many

708
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,460
trade secrets but you can put evergreen

709
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,959
and cease in the same container and you

710
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,019
can shake the [ __ ] out of them put them

711
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,730
in there with water like 15 to 30 mils

712
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,710
of evergreen and like

713
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,690
thirty to forty five millilitres of

714
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,640
cease and to spray that [ __ ] on your

715
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,309
plants it'll help ya you can mix it but

716
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,950
we will do multiple products at a time

717
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,269
um we've got a new product that we've

718
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,890
only used a couple times and this

719
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,039
employee has never applied this product

720
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,440
before he did everything correctly

721
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,049
however at some point he mentioned that

722
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,529
he did get a couple of drops of this

723
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,450
pesticide on his wrist area and he said

724
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,399
he immediately removed his glove because

725
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,009
it got past the glove it got higher than

726
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,600
the glove way so he removed his glove he

727
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,279
went to the sink area and he washed his

728
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,289
hand for a few minutes as directed then

729
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,819
he went back and put on his gloves he

730
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,259
dried himself off went by put on his

731
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:44,829
gloves and applied the pesticide as

732
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:46,900
planned he was okay later on that

733
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:50,139
evening his hand was turning a little

734
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,550
bit red and it didn't bother him he

735
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,680
sprayed around 3 p.m.

736
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,569
around 10:30 that night he sent me a

737
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,759
text message saying hey I'm having an

738
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,829
allergic reaction to that spray check

739
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,319
this out and he sent me a picture of his

740
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:04,659
leg with welts growing on it it looked

741
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,789
it looked like he had just welts all

742
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,620
over his thigh area it was bad it was

743
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,500
red and funky and it was a little

744
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:12,879
concerning so I was like dude we have to

745
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500

it was 10:30 at night there was nothing

747
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,680
I could do about it at the time other

748
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,539
than tell him go to the hospital if you

749
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,670
feel that's what you need to do because

750
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:23,440

751
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,090

friend had been exposed to pesticides

808
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:16,598
now it was really funny because they're

809
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,848
like what are you here for I was like

810
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:20,468
pesticide exposure they're instant

811
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:22,239
reaction was too freaked out they were

812
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:23,619
like did you bring it in here how long

813
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:25,058
ago did you change clothes are you

814
00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:27,069
wearing the same clothes did you shower

815
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:29,108
and I was like my buddy was kind of

816
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,548
before that what they're checking in

817
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:33,009
they asked him they asked him like

818
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:35,168
height weight birthday address name

819
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:37,088
phone number and then they said do you

820
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:39,489
feel safe at home and he goes what the

821
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:41,558
[ __ ] and the nurse left she goes do you

822
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:42,999
feel safe at home and he goes yeah and

823
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,999
she explained that they have to ask that

824
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:49,329
because that may be some person's only

825
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:50,469
opportunity to say no so don't ever

826
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,898
laugh and I'm gonna ask you that [ __ ]

827
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:54,548
question because there may be one person

828
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:56,378
that says no I need some [ __ ] help

829
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:58,358
it's scary at home someone's doing [ __ ]

830
00:26:56,378 --> 00:27:00,338
to me so that's what that's for don't

831
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:01,928
laugh but my buddy was thrown off by

832
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:03,548
that question so I had to kind of

833
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,889
interrupt and explain I was like dude

834
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:07,808
this happened yesterday at 3:20 my

835
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:10,238
friend went home he changed clothes

836
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:12,009
immediately he's taking two or three

837
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:14,229
showers since then he came to work and

838
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,329
worked all day and hasn't been near that

839
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:17,919
pesticide I was off on the day that the

840
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:19,868
application happened I haven't been near

841
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,399
the pesticide or the applied room at all

842
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:23,499
I was like all this [ __ ] happened

843
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,908
yesterday and they all took a big breath

844
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:26,679
and calm down they're like

845
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,720
ah we're about to put you guys in the

846
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,769
decontamination shower so me and my

847
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,149
buddy were about to get a shower

848
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:32,829
together it sounded like which would

849
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:34,569
have been super awkward we were gonna

850
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:36,249
throw into the decontamination unit

851
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,388
which would have been really a longer

852
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:39,429
story than this who would have been a

853
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:41,258
lot more expensive of a building what it

854
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:44,349
was luckily I was able to speak up and

855
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,298
tell him that wasn't necessary so they

856
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:47,618
ended up telling my friend that it was

857
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:50,618
certainly an allergic reaction to the

858
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:52,028
pesticide they're like and my friend

859
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:53,798
kept saying but I didn't get it on my

860
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:55,929
legs and they explained you don't have

861
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,479
to get it on your legs the stuff you got

862
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:00,909
on you your body is allergic to it you

863
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:02,528
had a reaction it's trying to move that

864
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,710
reaction around your body to deal with

865
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:07,628
it so he got these weird hives all over

866
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,239
himself these welts these hive looking

867
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:11,769
things all over his body they told him

868
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:13,569
to take a couple of benadryl and take

869
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,159
benadryl every time it started flared up

870
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,239
and he said it was starting to itch real

871
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,639
bad you could see him trying not to

872
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:20,558
scratch it and they also gave him a

873
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:22,028
steroid shot this said the steroid shot

874
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,239
would speed it up and help his body heal

875
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:27,519
and recover from it so I gave him the

876
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:29,739
next day off he's got three days off in

877
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,479
a row right now I called him today it's

878
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:33,429
been he had a full day without me

879
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:35,109
bugging him then I called him today and

880
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:37,119
he said that he feels just fine that it

881
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:38,949
flares up occasionally and it itches

882
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:41,999
when he does but he takes a benadryl and

883
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,288
it goes away so he's doing much better

884
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:46,089
so by now I'm sure a lot of people are

885
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:49,210
going why is Jeff telling us about his

886
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:51,418
friend [ __ ] up with the pesticide I'm

887
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,759
telling you this because my friend got

888
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,739
drops of the pesticide on himself just a

889
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,319
few drops you can see where the drops

890
00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:00,909
landed on his skin and left little marks

891
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,979
you can see how much you can actually

892
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:05,169
see how much [ __ ] landed on him because

893
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:06,970
it gave him a tattoo it changed his skin

894
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:08,710
colour right there it's back now but it

895
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,038
temporarily changed his skin colour and

896
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:15,460
it messed up his whole body I gave him a

897
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:17,769
fever it made him a chi it gave him

898
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,358
welts and these weird bumps all over

899
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:21,069
himself these hive-like bumps and he

900
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,210
wanted to scratch them and I feel that

901
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,348
if he would have scratched them he would

902
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,399
have ripped something open and he would

903
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:27,249
have been bleeding and gotten himself

904
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,358
infected just by how bad they looked the

905
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,979
reason I'm telling you guys this is

906
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,868
because I want you to be more careful

907
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:33,940
when applying pesticides a lot of us

908
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:36,128
myself included we've talked about this

909
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,639
at the girl we've all gotten everybody

910
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,838
that grows that's been

911
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,668
doing this for a long time has all

912
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:43,729
gotten a little a little lackadaisical

913
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:45,379
maybe the word we are a little

914
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:46,909
complacent when it comes to applying

915
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:49,578
pesticides and or being around

916
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:51,320
pesticides I know I did a podcast a

917
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:53,808
while back about pesticide safety and

918
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,848
pesticide training we've all had that

919
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:58,278
training it might grow several times and

920
00:29:55,848 --> 00:30:00,888
something still happened so I want you

921
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:02,538
guys to be careful then the next thing I

922
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:04,668
want you to do is think about what

923
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:06,919
you're going to do if you do have a

924
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,239
pesticide problem if you're exposed to

925
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,429
something and you've got an emergency

926
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:12,649
what are you going to do to help

927
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,719
yourself is there somebody you can call

928
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:15,768
is there somebody at home with you are

929
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:18,048
you [ __ ]

930
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,608
do you have an illegal grow if you're

931
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:22,219
running an illegal grow and you apply a

932
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:23,778
pesticide and let's I don't want

933
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,950
anything bad to happen to you I didn't

934
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,450
want anything bad to happen to my

935
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,558
coworker I may have said his name so I

936
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,759
have to [ __ ] listen back to this

937
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,338
whole thing and make sure I didn't say

938
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,479
anything say my buddy's name I didn't

939
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:36,019
want anything to happen to him but it

940
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:38,209
did and luckily I have a support team

941
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:40,578
that I can reach out to and say hey that

942
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:42,649
[ __ ] happened I need guidance they gave

943
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:45,588
me step by step instruction on how to

944
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:48,168
handle this for my co-workers safety for

945
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:50,690
my safety and for the company safety you

946
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:54,079
may not have that so think about what

947
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,369
you're going to do let's just say you're

948
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:56,868
spraying you got your pump sprayer

949
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:58,458
however you apply your pesticide it's

950
00:30:56,868 --> 00:31:00,468
probably in some sort of a pump sprayer

951
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:02,808
you're pumping it something ruptures

952
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:04,820
that [ __ ] explodes and pesticide goes

953
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:05,838
I don't want it in your high let's not

954
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,668
even go that extreme

955
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:09,499
you just get a pesticide up the side of

956
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,788
your face you got it on your cheek it's

957
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:12,798
kind of dripping down your neck it's

958
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:15,048
enough to make you go off [ __ ] I just

959
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,969
got a bunch of evergreen on my neck what

960
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:19,459
are you going to do do you have a plan

961
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:21,200
are you gonna freak out if you've got an

962
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:24,440
illegal grow and you've got to go to the

963
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,569
hospital for this you need a reason to

964
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,669
be spraying evergreen you can't have

965
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:31,398
spraying it on my weed plants so think

966
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:34,070
about all this stuff have the number for

967
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,618
poison control handy it's a regional

968
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:38,598
number I think I don't want to give you

969
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:40,608
the wrong number just google poison

970
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:41,598
control on your phone and you will have

971
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,739
the right number there's one number you

972
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,908
can call and they transfer you to the

973
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:45,919
correct region it's actually what

974
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:48,059
happens so have the poison control phone

975
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,399
number on your phone

976
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:52,469
if you've got an advanced phone you can

977
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,048
talk into it and you can say call poison

978
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:57,179
control so if you need help your phone

979
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:59,118
Siri will call poison control for you

980
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,889
they can give you advice on what to do

981
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:03,808
don't be afraid to call 9-1-1 if you've

982
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:05,548
got pesticides in your eyes you're gonna

983
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:08,579
need help you're going to have to call

984
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:10,048
9-1-1 wear some goggles when you're as

985
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:12,960
soon as you pick that bottle up you

986
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:14,489
should have goggles on because maybe the

987
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,598
lids not put on and you go to shake it

988
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,950
mesh it flies in your eye

989
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:18,089
you haven't even applied it yet you

990
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,869
haven't poured it yet you've already

991
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:20,999
[ __ ] up

992
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:23,878
you needed goggles then get the goggles

993
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:26,460
early so know what you're gonna do if

994
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:28,918
you do have a problem you need most

995
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,229
pesticides I can't speak for every

996
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,239
pesticide most of them if you get it on

997
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:36,598
your skin the thing you need to do is

998
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:37,079
rinse for 15 minutes wouldn't be a

999
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:39,210
problem

1000
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,308
just rinse that area for 15 minutes if

1001
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,469
you've got some antibacterial soap scrub

1002
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:45,719
that [ __ ] on there get that pesticide

1003
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:47,609
off of your skin it's better to rinse

1004
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:49,859
too much and wash too heavily then just

1005
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:51,928
to be lazy and leave some on there so

1006
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:55,618
get in there and rinse that [ __ ] off if

1007
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:57,839
you see anything like a welt or anything

1008
00:32:55,618 --> 00:33:01,378
like your skin raising or turning white

1009
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:02,848
or changing colors maybe consider going

1010
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:04,588
to the hospital and getting looked at

1011
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:08,038
it's gonna be expensive but your health

1012
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:10,079
is priceless okay luckily my coworker

1013
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,319
was able to take some benadryl and get a

1014
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,668
shot he didn't have anything too serious

1015
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,009
please don't put yourself in my

1016
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:18,809
co-workers position I know I've been

1017
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,598
ranting about this for a long time but

1018
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:23,190
it was scary my buddy was already [ __ ]

1019
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:25,079
up from pesticides and then I was

1020
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,639
watching him just have a [ __ ] nervous

1021
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,989
breakdown because he was so scared of

1022
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,248
what he may have done to his body and

1023
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,619
what may happen to him at the hospital

1024
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:34,348
it was not a fun experience for anybody

1025
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:35,398
and it was quite expensive luckily it'll

1026
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,019
be covered because we have a great

1027
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,329
company workman's comp handles that sort

1028
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,679
of [ __ ] but if that was you at home and

1029
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:42,210
you had to pay for it out of pocket or

1030
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,950
through your insurance you're gonna have

1031
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,129
some explaining to do and it's gonna get

1032
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,048
expensive so I'm gonna say it again have

1033
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:51,358
a plan if you [ __ ] up with pesticides

1034
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:53,460
have a plan know what you're gonna do

1035
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:54,898
you need to clean yourself you need to

1036
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,970
get the clothes off of you if it's on

1037
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:58,018
your clothes you need to shower if you

1038
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,150
feel like you need medical attention

1039
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:02,009
don't be shy go get it okay

1040
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,259
it's always best to have somebody around

1041
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:07,140
when you're applying pesticides always

1042
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:08,760
use the proper equipment goggles all the

1043
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,800
time from the minute you pick up that

1044
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,680
pest put the goggles on then pick up the

1045
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,740
pesticide bottle have gloves on at least

1046
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,779
those six mil six millimeter thick

1047
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,909
nitrile gloves at least wear those

1048
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,150
you're supposed to wear something twelve

1049
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,039
milliliter 12 millimeters thick when

1050
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,170
you're handling a pesticide a lot of the

1051
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,570
pesticides need something thicker wear

1052
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:34,050
those thicker gloves wear long sleeves

1053
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,880
wear pants definitely cover your [ __ ]

1054
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,680
feet make sure that your feet are

1055
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,849
covered all the pesticides gonna fall to

1056
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,769
the ground and you're gonna walk in it

1057
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:43,710
the bottoms of your feet are some of the

1058
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:44,940
most absorb absorb I don't know the

1059
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,760
proper word the bottoms of your feet

1060
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,309
absorb a lot they're able to it's the

1061
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,740
most absorption II I don't [ __ ] know

1062
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:54,239
pick a word right there it absorbs the

1063
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,069
most the bottom of your feet your

1064
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,779
genitals your eyes in your mouth your

1065
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,789
palms that's where you can absorb a lot

1066
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,530
of stuff so don't go walking around in

1067
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:04,529
pesticides cover up your feet if you're

1068
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:07,610
applying pesticides always always always

1069
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,280
follow the re-entry interval rules on

1070
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,720
the bottle it's on every bottle also

1071
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,370
here's something to think about if

1072
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,649
you've got a home grow if you've got an

1073
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:19,349
indoor grow and you don't have major air

1074
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,360
circulation you need to give extra time

1075
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,579
for what's called a ventilation period

1076
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,710
when you apply a pesticide in a room it

1077
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,269
becomes basically a vapor if you're

1078
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,650
using a paint sprayer or a pump sprayer

1079
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:30,389
you've turned it into little vapors and

1080
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,309
it's floating around the room you have

1081
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:34,710
to allow two hours for a ventilation

1082
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:37,469
period for that vapor to dissipate and

1083
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,150
become tool and essentially it needs to

1084
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,529
land that fog in the room needs to go

1085
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,750
away so you've got a two hour

1086
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,880
ventilation period before your reentry

1087
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,500
interval starts so a lot of the products

1088
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,150
we're using have a four and eight a

1089
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,139
twelve none of them should have a

1090
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,340
24-hour re intro re-entry interval if it

1091
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,349
does you're using some major [ __ ] you

1092
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,289
may want to reconsider that but follow

1093
00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:00,599
those rules carefully and wear your

1094
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,550
personal protective equipment if you

1095
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,460
have to go in there early please take it

1096
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:07,470
seriously you guys I've seen very minor

1097
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,000
effects of things going wrong with

1098
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:12,119
pesticides and it was a scary situation

1099
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,909
I don't want it to happen to anybody I

1100
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,940
don't want it to happen to

1101
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:18,469
you I want you to be safe one thing I

1102
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,139
would recommend is before you apply a

1103
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,639
pesticide read what to do should you

1104
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:25,578
[ __ ] up so that you don't have to be

1105
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,348
struggling panicking having a freakout

1106
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:28,940
possibly have [ __ ] in your eyes and then

1107
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:31,940
trying to read a bottle to figure out

1108
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,500
what to do read it before also should

1109
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,940
you need to go to the hospital I don't

1110
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,858
want you to have to but you may have to

1111
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,210
you guys this this [ __ ] comes up I had

1112
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:40,670
to take a good friend to the hospital if

1113
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,309
you have to go to the hospital take the

1114
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,659
labels off of the bottles don't take

1115
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,769
them too far into the hospital before

1116
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,029
you tell somebody which you've got

1117
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:48,949
because they're gonna want to put it in

1118
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,170
a safe container so you don't spread any

1119
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:56,480
of that pesticide around the hospital if

1120
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:58,250
you can if time allows take a shower and

1121
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,170
change your clothes anything you were

1122
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,568
wearing when you applied pesticides take

1123
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,039
it off rinse your body thoroughly put on

1124
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:05,989
fresh clothes that aren't contaminated

1125
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:07,579
with pesticides then go to the hospital

1126
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:09,618
so that way you don't contaminate the

1127
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,119
hospital with pesticides also you don't

1128
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:13,130
contaminate the people that help you the

1129
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,660
doctor the nurse the triage nurse the

1130
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,430
delay Tia check in the security guard

1131
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,929
the takes your knife from you I just

1132
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:20,409
don't contaminate them with pesticides

1133
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:23,328
also pay attention to pesticides I

1134
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:25,429
encourage everybody to read all of the

1135
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:27,440
labeling on all the pesticides you were

1136
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:29,179
using I encourage you to use all the

1137
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,099
proper equipment that you need for all

1138
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:34,519
of those pesticides do not take any of

1139
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:36,230
it lightly and please be careful with

1140
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,849
the pesticides you're using outdoors do

1141
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,380
not [ __ ] up our environment so that you

1142
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:41,990
can grow some cannabis all right it's

1143
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,338
not worth it that all of the land is not

1144
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,868
yours just that one plot that you're

1145
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:46,338
growing on and that spray that you're

1146
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,410
spraying is affecting the entire world

1147
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:49,849
and it's not fair so please be

1148
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,558
respectful if you're spraying pesticides

1149
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:53,720
outside no matter what you're doing with

1150
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:56,028
this pesticide please be careful please

1151
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,199
respect the [ __ ] in that bottle it's not

1152
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,818
a joke all right I feel like I've been

1153

enjoying the throwback Thursday episodes

1253
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:15,239
that I'm making almost every Thursday I

1254
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,190
put out a long block of old episodes my

1255
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,859
reason for doing so is because on iTunes

1256
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,260
and stitcher those feeds only hold 100

1257
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,750
episodes that means that the most recent

1258
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,250
100 shows are there and all the old [ __ ]

1259
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,170
falls right out of the feed so I've been

1260
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,599
making long blocks of episodes to make

1261
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,130
those good episodes available once again

1262
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,259
so new listeners can go back and hear

1263
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,240
old content once I get caught up I'll

1264
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,820
stop doing it the good part is I'm

1265
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,649
putting old episodes up on YouTube

1266
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,930
YouTube will not limit how many shows

1267
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,920
I've got so if you check out YouTube's

1268
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:47,039
search for the girl from your heart

1269
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,130
podcast you will find I think there are

1270
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,500
approximately 75 to 80 videos up on

1271
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,119
YouTube now I do plan on making more it

1272
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,280
just is time consuming and I'm a

1273
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,630
hard-working young man so don't have a

1274
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,430
lot of time to sit here and make YouTube

1275
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,980
videos but I'll get them up so that you

1276
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:03,419
can enjoy them ladies and gentlemen I

1277
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,039
think you can hear my voice cutting out

1278
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,480
