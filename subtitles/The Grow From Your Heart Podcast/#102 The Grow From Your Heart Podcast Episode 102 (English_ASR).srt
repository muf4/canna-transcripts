and asked me a question he had a

165
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:24,339
question for me because I I was part of

166
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,559
the show at the end of the show they

167
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:27,668
play games and they play a game called

168
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
the last man standing

169
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:32,560
the thing is somebody in the audience

170
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,209
names an actor and then the participants

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,069
in the game have to name movies that

172
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,599
that actor has been in until they run

173
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,579
out you know we just keep going back and

174
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,830
forth until one was a I dunno mom yeah

175
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,599
and so uh Doug knew that I listened to

176
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:44,949
the podcast so he's like Rasta Jeff will

177
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,360
definitely have a name for us we'll go

178
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,038
to him for a name in just a minute so he

179
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,389
let me give him the name and when it

180
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,379
came time to it I said I have two names

181
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,579
in my head do you want me to give you

182
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,139
two of them any pick one he goes nope

183
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,879
just give me one and we'll do it I was

184
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,099
like alright so the name I gave them for

185
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,469
the game was Philip Seymour Hoffman

186
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,789
because I mean he's got a lot of [ __ ]

187
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,960
movies and they should know a lot of oh

188
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,189
that's a good one it was really good

189
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,370
they liked it they had a lot of fun with

190
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,649
it

191
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,728
so after the show Jeff Tate walked up

192
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,199
and he's like who was your other name

193
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,240
bro and it's funny because I always

194
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,680
forget the guy's [ __ ] name and I had

195
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,720
it like in my head right at that moment

196
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,038
for when he asked what I forgot NYX I

197
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,520
knew my time was up and I go I forgot

198
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,288
dude

199
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,449
you know and I go yeah but I always

200
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:21,788
forget his name and I said he played the

201
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,680
president in mocking and before I could

202
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,969
say Mockingjay he goes oh [ __ ] Donald

203
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,538
Sutherland dude and hit me on the

204
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,400
shoulder

205
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,899
so that dude knows his [ __ ] movies

206
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,310
Jeff Tate knows his movies real well

207
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,139
shoutout to Jeff day they made me feel

208
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,240
like a friend like these guys treat me

209
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,009
like I am a homie now when I walk

210
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,689
through comedy works I get high fives

211
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,069
I didn't even walk me to my seat anymore

212
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,769

215
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,169
used to go there on college that's I

216
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:52,109
mean I love going to music shows but

217
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:53,878
some music crowds are [ __ ] yep the

218
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,408
crowds have evolved into [ __ ] that

219
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,729
want to shove their way to the front and

220
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,259
spill their beer on you and just be a

221
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:59,519
disrespectful dick and don't appreciate

222
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,080
the show and they kind of ruin some

223
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,698
concerts for me I started enjoying

224
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,568
sitting in the back and getting high as

225
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,340
[ __ ] a long time ago right getting older

226
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,720
but comedy shows they don't allow any of

227
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,038
that pushing and shoving [ __ ]

228
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,930
they'll kick you right out if you heckle

229
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,430
so you're sitting down the whole time

230
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,959
and you can order food and they bring it

231
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,120

Scout cookies know what's let's take a

248
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,580
quick second here do you realize what I

249
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,278
just asked you I do there are people in

250
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,500
places they were probably just smacking

251
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:06,538
their smdh smacked my damn head right

252
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:07,889
now yeah when I first saw it but uh

253
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:09,839
there's somebody just where this

254
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,759
[ __ ] got Girl Scout cookies and

255
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,649
gorilla glue just sitting there ready to

256
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,538
smoke yes you guys and it's not even

257
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:18,959
flowers it's the most beautiful hash

258
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:21,180
you've ever seen we're we are spoiled

259
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,339
here anyway Mike yes for legalization

260
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,199
while we're on it yes but when you do

261
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:30,448
make sure that you include some sort of

262
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,579
law or it allows you to have some sort

263
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,229
of consumption place where everybody can

264
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,639
gather and smoke cannabis because that's

265
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,079
what we missed here in Colorado and

266
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,788
right now we're struggling to get those

267
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:40,620
types of rules in place if you like some

268
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:42,569
wonderful nurse I would like yes dude

269
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,679
enlightened me but before you do let's

270
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,879
make a decision here would you like the

271
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,649
Girl Scout cookies or would you like

272
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,929
this is gonna go with the gorilla glue

273
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,698
only because right before we started

274
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,250
recording we did sample the Girl Scout

275
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:55,519
yes we did all right

276
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,960
it was quite wonderful but I coughed for

277
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,000
quite a bit so I'm hoping the gorilla

278
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,019
glue will be slightly less choking for

279
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,889
me I'm gonna give you a little dab

280
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:07,789
Mike's kind of Mike why don't I no shame

281
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,019
people take the dab you want that's the

282
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,399
truth you guys yeah you don't have to

283
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,889
dab like I do take a DAB that's

284
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,929
comfortable for you Mike just said that

285
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,819
he had some news to share I'm gonna make

286
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,009
Mike share his news before he takes this

287
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,780
dad because I talked about he's gonna

288
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:22,909
cop for 30 seconds and then this dad

289
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,559
will be your reward for a quick coffee

290
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,120
just thinking about it yeah this damn is

291
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,199
your reward that is waiting for you and

292
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,929
I'm gonna dad while you tell us about

293
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,780
your news so I got a text a few days ago

294
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:35,629
from a local friend of mine in the

295
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:38,449
industry down here he's always been kind

296
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:40,210
of a step removed like he's not an owner

297
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,820
of a dispensary or anything like that

298
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,680
but he got me a text and he had a

299
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,510
licensing hearing he needed he wanted me

300
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:53,989
to attend and he received his special

301
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:56,569
use permit to open a cannabis museum

302
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,610
slash consumption location here in

303
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,890
Pueblo County is this somebody that I

304
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,519
know yep cool is it the person I think I

305
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,838
know probably okay cool we'll talk

306
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,199
specifics off the shadow greener side

307
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,940
Empire talking about old school greener

308
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:18,860
side Empire what up hanky B hope you're

309
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:24,470
doing well homie it's not it's not what

310
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,370
up shorter dude with curly hair so look

311
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,330
for that comment

312
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,700
so a cannabis museum during the

313
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,820
licensing hearing his description of it

314
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,839
would be a marijuana themed Hard Rock

315
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,760
Cafe would be the closest business that

316
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,320
he could relate it to that everyone's

317
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,019
familiar with so when you sit down at

318
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,240
your your booth with the marijuana

319
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,980
product you bring yourself there will be

320
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,620
stuff on the wall that's like marijuana

321
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,420
was originally outlawed and about like

322
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,610
historical stuff and they've hired local

323
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,569
historians like professional historians

324
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,159
that do this for a living

325
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,140
Wow and are currently researching

326

333
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,950
be great and useful but then they need

334
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,569
to come to somebody involved in it right

335
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,040

Mike said something about public

374
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,600
consumption I am going to humble myself

375
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,580
I'm going to eat a little bit of crow if

376

377
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,330
crow before I get the phrase and now

378
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,680
that I've said it I understand where it

379
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,730
comes in perfectly I've never said that

380
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,469
I've heard it and thought that's a weird

381
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,730
phrase but it just came in perfectly so

382
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:07,269
shout out to the phrase eat some crow

383
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:08,800

384
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,939

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,669
they were expecting I'm gonna go to the

435
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,139
next row like I've never gone to one of

436
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,539
their events for personal normal

437
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,610

438
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,629
stubborn [ __ ] something in me if I

439
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,070
don't like you for something you've done

440
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,259
in the past I'm probably not gonna like

441
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,940
you in the future but I see them trying

442
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,500
to make progress I've tried to work with

443
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,240
those people before and we just butt

444
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,250
heads and so I've kind of separated

445
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,360
myself but I'm gonna get over it and I'm

446
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,490
gonna go there next eBay because they

447
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,600
crushed it this time all right so I

448
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,509

454
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,370
that when I heard how well it went I was

455

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,809
have gone that's fully the first time I

458
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,028
felt about one of their events and they

459
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,889
finally did it right from what I hear

460
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:42,149

00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,838
he hasn't missed a show yet it was so

488
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:44,278
funny I'm gonna try not to miss any -

489
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,990
it's gonna be a good time if the

490
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,419
listeners out there want this experience

491
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,220
the way to do it is amazing we don't

492
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:54,509
tell - every Doug Benson show it's just

493
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,180
the gut the slide Denver's taken like

494
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,559
there's a way to do this go bananas I

495
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,769
think that's the club in Cincinnati

496
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,969
maybe if that's see like I almost want a

497
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:05,490
google at you let's I'm gonna take

498
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,689
[ __ ] 30 seconds we might pause it we

499
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,779
might not let's see we're gonna have

500
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:15,480
Siri do it yeah I've been a duck fan for

501
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:18,178
a long time we'll see I just ask Siri

502
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,578
where's the club go bananas live

503
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,160
stand-up since a [ __ ] nati bro I'm

504
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:27,418
such a comedy geek go bananas

505
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,220
you listen to a lot of podcasting things

506
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,660
I alright because we've been rambling on

507
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,339
for like 20 minutes let's get on to a

508
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,860
topic here we've got a couple of things

509
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,199
in the news that we could talk about um

510
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:38,909
I read an article I'm not gonna read you

511
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,480
the article because it's forever long

512
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,970
it's way too many words

513
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,798
long but I found this article on a

514
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,200
website called The Guardian Mike also

515
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,400
read it so we'll be able to discuss it

516
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,808
without reading it here on the show and

517
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,798
we'll be able to paraphrase a little bit

518
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:55,750
for you guys and tell you what it's

519
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:57,339
about essentially um they're talking

520
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,619
about an influx of people coming from

521
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:02,678
across the country to Pueblo Colorado

522
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:05,678
because Pueblo Colorado for the size of

523
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,720
the city that we are and for our

524
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,990
economic development and the amount of

525
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,539
cannabis jobs available we are the most

526
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,279
affordable place to land when you come

527
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:19,779
from out of state would you agree with

528
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:23,139
that Mike um we routinely ranked is like

529
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:25,210
the cheapest city in Colorado for our

530
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,410
size and size yeah right if you went to

531
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,660
anywhere smaller you're pretty much

532
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,190
[ __ ] like the next move there's not

533
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,679
like you have to have a shitload of

534
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,779
money to live in nowhere land yeah and

535
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,009
this is there's a hundred thousand

536
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,259
people here which is just about perfect

537
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:40,629
for coming to a city that's not too

538
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:42,519
expensive trying to get a new star it's

539
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,380
not right he's one of the cheapest

540
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,000
cities in the u.s. recently it's it's

541
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,950
yeah we're gonna bring that up later

542
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,419
Denver can spit some people out Denver

543
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,910
can chew you up a little bit you well

544
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,380
there's a lot of there's a lot of lot of

545
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,690
reasons people are moving to pueblos

546
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,970
right now legal marijuana is definitely

547
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,500
one of them yes but let's dive into the

548
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,789
story because I'm about to talk about a

549
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,400
bunch of it's like a pulling the [ __ ]

550
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:10,029
on the chains on your I've been a part I

551
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,040
was a part of this story in like a back

552
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,019
room since I've met with all the players

553
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,909
about this topic but don't spill too

554
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:21,039
many of those beans I won't so they're

555
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,769
saying that all of these people moving

556
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,099
to Pueblo Colorado are beginning to put

557
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:28,629
a burden on our resources here we have a

558
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,069
resource called Posada which is a

559
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,280
nonprofit organization that helps

560
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,720
families get there some themselves on

561
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,639
their feet if something happens to

562
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,210
somebody here in Pueblo they can go to

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,980
Posada

564
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,450
for example there's a guy in this news

565
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,798
article that hurt his foot something

566
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,269
fell on him and broke his foot and he

567
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:44,740
can't work for a little bit so he's

568
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,150
going to Posada to get a little bit of

569
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,620
help maybe I don't know what they're

570
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,210
given and possibly some food probably

571
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,439
some cheese I'm saying just to keep him

572
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,730
on his feet while he's unable to work

573
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,880
but they're saying that

574
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,980
those resources at Posada are being

575
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,690
strained and the people are coming from

576
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,640
all over the nation to come work here

577
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,480
and they're not prepared like you look

578
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,730
like you got something on your mind

579
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,279
already you're stewing but no it's so

580
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,250
what they're getting at is that legal

581
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:14,149
marijuana is creating a huge homeless

582
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,400
problem in Pueblo Colorado right and

583
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,040
it's not like causing good hardworking

584
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,410
Americans who got hooked on marijuana to

585
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,440
become homeless it's attracting homeless

586
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,509
people in other areas to pueblos

587
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:31,340
apparently and the article goes on to

588
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:34,548
say people that work at Posada and a

589
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:37,240
couple other agencies in town saying

590
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:39,529
that they've had huge increases in

591
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,058
people seeking services from them

592
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:47,839
whether it's housing vouchers or food

593
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:52,539
stamps or medicine bank medicine

594
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,539
vouchers or help with medical problems

595
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:58,459
Posada especially has been pretty vocal

596
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:01,220
with the press down here in Pueblo and

597
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,230
then it's spiraled nationally when the

598
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,150
anti pot groups picked it up and started

599
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,029
pushing it other newspapers started

600
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,640
picking it up that one of the problems

601
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:14,058
caused by amendment 64 is more homeless

602
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,690
people coming to Colorado because of our

603
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:21,109
marijuana laws and just that idea never

604
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,610
really made sense to me until I realized

605
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:24,740
that it's not illegal to be homeless

606
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:28,668
most places but it is illegal to have

607
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,169
pop most places right and homeless

608
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,669
people have huge rates of substance

609
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:36,110
abuse and if if you're homeless

610
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,549
consuming substances is a way to deal

611
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:42,199
with some of the miserable conditions

612
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:43,519
and that lifestyle absolutely so if you

613
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,019
can move to a place where they're not

614
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,869
going to chase you around and throw you

615
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:51,109
in jail for having some weed why not be

616
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:52,639
there and when that's combined with a

617
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,500
number of other things that are

618
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,380
happening at the same time like legal

619
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,750
marijuana here everybody's talking about

620
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,309
how many thousands of people are working

621
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,740
in the industry and how much money it's

622
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:05,599
making no one's talking about what it

623
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,370
takes to get an Emmy D badge

624
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,959
so that's something I was gonna touch on

625
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,899
in a few minutes when you're homeless

626
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,029
and there's a new booming industry

627
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,190
I mean it's humans been doing it since

628
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:19,129
humans started doing anything we move

629
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,140
for to where there's work especially

630
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,270
when there's no work and we're just

631
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,430
coming out of a depression like a

632
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:28,220
national depression where works hard to

633
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,860
come by everywhere especially in our age

634
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,950
demographic yep remember all those

635
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:37,899
articles about people than their 30s

636
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,900
that moved home after college right

637
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,169
degrees had a no I'm still not saying me

638
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:44,599
but a lot of them got degrees unlike

639
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,039
internet stuff those jobs are all taken

640
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,269
up that [ __ ] kind of failed but not

641
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,920
failed but I mean it's just gotten so

642
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,450
much easier to make a webpage that that

643
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,670
guy that used to know how to do it isn't

644
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,990
and I have a theory that that's gonna

645
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,340
happen to the weed grower to I'm gonna

646
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,680
do a whole report on that here on the

647
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,939
podcast in the future so yeah those

648

778
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,029
call Sallie Mae and start making

779
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,250
payments you know all they want is a

780
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,589
receipt and tip that you're paying I had

781
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,970
to do it like I had to go show them that

782
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,829
my student loans were in good order I

783
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,240
had to do is get a thing from both loan

784
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,428
companies it was really easy I filled

785
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,960
out I printed the application online I

786
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,429
printed it at home I filled it I took me

787
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,840
like 30 minutes to do it whatever you

788
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:51,450
know it's just like a thick job

789
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,279
application but really thorough yeah and

790
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,429
then they give it to the FBI who checks

791
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,839
it so you can't just lie and while

792
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:59,460
they're checking a better smartest [ __ ]

793
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,439
they take your paperwork and start

794
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,360
running it then they call you back while

795
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,220
it's being ran and they fingerprint you

796
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,079
and they take their sweet [ __ ] time

797
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,579
fingerprinting you so that if there is

798
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,168
anything wrong with your paperwork and

799
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:11,579
they if you're illegal if you've got

800
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,980
warrants they'll come and get your ass

801
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:16,589
right there I I wondered why it took so

802
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,900
long it seemed like the tech was brand

803
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:21,089
new and yet it took her 74 tries to get

804
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,040
my index finger oh yeah that finger

805
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:27,089
funny thing that laser reading finger

806
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,769
printer is hard it feels like right you

807
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:31,199
know I've actually come to rest in case

808
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,779

this podcast my niche is making seeds my

901
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:56,038
niche is growing like a [ __ ]

902
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,629
my initials taking care of my patients

903
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,940
and paying attention to what works for

904
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:02,668
them medicinally and adjusting my gross

905
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,919
schedule and micronutrients and my gross

906
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,049
strains to work for my individual

907
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,909
patients medical needs which is an art

908

enough weed from Mike and enough weed

910
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:14,248
for Doug and other people that I supply

911
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:16,558
and have the right strains at the right

912
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:18,058
times for these people it takes a little

913
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,928
bit of scheduling and a little bit of

914
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:23,490
foresight so whatever you do if you're a

915

moved out here with just the hope and a

931
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,450
prayer most of them have had to beg

932
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,460
people for money so that they can haul

933
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:08,019
their ass back home and that has to suck

934

two hundred thousand bucks that he can

941

lose their licensing because you did

942
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,589

ass in that building without being seen

1008
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,579
if you do something really funny you can

1009
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:49,900
go to the office and ask for the footage

1010
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,809

to the point where they can read number

1015
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:10,480
on my car outside a parking lot with the

1016
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,920
camera yeah that's how [ __ ] smooth

1017
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,800
those cameras were they were reading VIN

1018
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,720
numbers on cars like people really don't

1019
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,130
understand the level of regulation the

1020
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,139
scrutiny that the industries on those

1021
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,640
cameras go about a hundred feet all the

1022
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:23,019
way around the perimeter of the building

1023
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,219
all the way like a hundred feet

1024
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:25,509
seriously I'm not even kidding they go

1025
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:27,339
all the way to the street and [ __ ]

1026
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,840
that's why you hear about a dispensary

1027
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,460
getting robbed in Colorado you hear

1028
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,170

1047
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,409
anka say consumption could cost the shop

1048
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:25,119
its license right we can't carry our

1049
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:27,399
beverages ah I can't as uh as a guy that

1050
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,559
works in the back I can take my bottle

1051
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,760
mine but my Dr Pepper after lunch I can

1052
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,529
take that back to the back of the

1053
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,550
building but they will not let me take

1054
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,530
my drink into the bud room when

1055
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:40,220
visit Mike when I'm chatting him up when

1056
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,540
I'm taking a pee break like if Mike's my

1057
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,279
can I hardly ever see each other at work

1058
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:45,320
but when we do it's like hey buddy no

1059
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,510
open containers in the bedroom if you

1060
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,830
say you were a customer and you spilled

1061
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,870
that [ __ ] in a jar we'd

1062
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:53,539
I couldn't even charge you for what you

1063
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:57,259
just ruined because I can legally only

1064
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:59,000
sell you an ounce or an ounce where your

1065
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,760
license says you're from that's shitty

1066
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,849
um and so if you're from Texas and you

1067
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,670
spill your your water into a jar weed

1068
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,860
that's got eight ounces a weed in it

1069
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:11,599
this shops gotta eat a lot of money and

1070
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,970
that's where that's my job

1071
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,829
ouch so can you take your water bottle

1072
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:18,019
back there anything only if it's got a

1073
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:21,650
lid okay just a water bottle and then

1074
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:22,789
like keep it well the [ __ ] away asking a

1075
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,309
pretty sure I've seen a couple of water

1076
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:26,869
bottles back by that window well the

1077
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,650
window edge is where they go that's

1078
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,659
where they're safe

1079
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,980
yeah the window ledge all right cool so

1080
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,269
yeah it's strict you guys what I'm

1081
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,240
getting at is there is no hanging out

1082
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:36,590
smoking pot being lazy having fun the

1083
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,059
only time I get to groove and have a

1084
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,890
good time is when I'm pushing a broom or

1085
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,989
a mop like I will catch myself shaking

1086
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:43,609
my ass cuz I got me we played we played

1087
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:46,039
loud music in the back and there's good

1088
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,480
music up front most of the time so

1089
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:49,309
there's good music going on is one of

1090
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,409
the best parts but the only time you get

1091
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:53,239
to chill out and have fun is on lunch

1092
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,069
breaks or sometimes we have a little

1093
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,599
team meetings and [ __ ] which are fun but

1094
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,400
it's hard work working at a dispensary

1095
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,839
you guys if you're coming here to work

1096
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,780
in the industry be ready to put it away

1097
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,910
put in work yeah don't you get serious

1098
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,990

1099
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:10,129
yeah should I go in and 9ish just

1100
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:11,899
depends on the day somewhere between

1101
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,250
eight and ten just depends on honestly

1102
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,480
how busy we're gonna be what I've got to

1103

how much time it's gonna take but

1105
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,800
sometimes we will leave there we've left

1106
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,910

of [ __ ] to do with it sometimes it's

1113
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:37,340

1130
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:13,909
for every one dude that is hireable

1131
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,190

that are way more attractive than you so

1133
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,789
if you're a dude and you're trying to

1134
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,260

1135
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,239

1138
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,500
uphill battle for a lot of you dudes

1139
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:35,719
clean up yeah always

1140
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:37,489
resume resume are you [ __ ] um let's see

1141
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:40,369
we've been going for 40 minutes holy

1142
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:43,549
crap um we're so big this is like the

1143
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:46,099
longest news article summation we didn't

1144
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,050
even read so many different places with

1145
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:53,480
this I like this podcast it felt right

1146
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:55,460
um so just to get slightly back on topic

1147
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,829
let's do it the thing that pisses me off

1148
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,309
the most about this whole legal pot

1149
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:03,469
causes an increase in homelessness

1150
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:06,049
nonsense is like one of the big reasons

1151
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:07,639
Puebla is experiencing a lot more

1152
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,230
homeless people right now looking for

1153
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:11,509
services or people on the brink of being

1154
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,490
homeless looking for services is because

1155
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,200
all of the cities around us

1156
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,549
currently bus homeless people out of

1157
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,579
that area that's the only way they've

1158
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,620
got to deal with it if Posada could have

1159
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,380
anything they wanted right now it would

1160
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:27,469
be millions more funding so that they

1161
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,329
could send everybody back home and

1162
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:31,489
there's a small reason for that like if

1163
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:33,679
you send everybody home hopefully

1164
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,119
they've got family friends people in the

1165
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,829
community that they know and can make

1166
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,809
contact with to help them get back on

1167
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,130
their feet like somewhere where they're

1168
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:42,110
tied to the community a little bit

1169
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:46,190
rather than here where they're strangers

1170
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:48,650
to everybody right but most places are

1171
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,630
just like hey guess what I hear this

1172
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,570
place it the way that you probably can't

1173
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:56,090
get back to without a lot of help is

1174
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:58,490
banging you should go there here's a bus

1175
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,610
ticket there for free bro they've got

1176
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:03,819
like everything you need

1177
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,950
um I had a guy asked me for a ride that

1178
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,630
one day and I probably would have told

1179
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:08,889
him no except the place he was asking to

1180
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,730
go was like a block and a half from

1181
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:12,369
where I was headed

1182
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,869
and I took a look at him and he looked

1183
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:16,630
totally [ __ ]

1184
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:18,309
but like recently like his clothes were

1185
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,849
clean but he looked like he had the

1186
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:23,380
worst day after the worst month ever and

1187
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:24,940
I was like alright dude I can give you a

1188
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,280
ride to where I'm already going I've

1189
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,079
like got like 150 pounds on you even if

1190
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,660

1192

a car like if I can reach you it's I win

1193
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:41,639
and his little story just wrecked me

1194
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:44,860
like he had a serious medical condition

1195
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:47,829
he was in Albuquerque and they were like

1196
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:50,200

1197

anybody yeah unless you're looking to

1205
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,329
invest a couple of million dollars in a

1206
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,960

1209
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,680
Colorado yeah we've got the Colorado

1210
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,689
unemployment rates like four point

1211
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,849
something it's one of the lower and the

1212
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,619
lowest in the nation but Pueblo is

1213
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:33,009
unemployment rate is like five and a

1214
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:35,019
half or six like a good point and a half

1215
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,030
higher than the rest of the state and

1216
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:38,380
when you magnify that times the amount

1217
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:42,280
of people that are in the state like

1218
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,559
it's a huge huge chunk of the jobs like

1219
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,390
there's a lot of people that came here

1220
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,340

1228
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:05,829

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,330

00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:08,710
marijuana industry only to find out that

1255
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:11,349
we don't take felons I mean multiple

1256
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,690
multiple that they just don't publicize

1257
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:17,259
any of the requirements anywhere outside

1258
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,490
of this podcast basically right yeah so

1259
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,960
that's your public service announcement

1260
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:21,039
you guys make sure you google that [ __ ]

1261
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,130
make sure you can find out if you're

1262
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,509
even qualified to work in our industry

1263
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,010
and if you're going if you're coming

1264
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,670
here to run in a legal industry I'm not

1265
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,740
even trying to be a smartass I was deep

1266
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,180
[ __ ] into the illegal cannabis industry

1267
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:35,589
I can admit it now I could talk about

1268
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:37,869
that you know what I had to get away

1269
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:39,340
from it because it wasn't gonna work

1270
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,710
much longer I was gonna go downhill

1271
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,440
trying to stay on that side of the world

1272
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,780
now I've got a steady job everything is

1273
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,010
legit it's much easier you guys it's

1274
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,930
much easier and that the illegal

1275
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,300
industry is going away you can see it

1276
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:54,789
crumbling here those people that are too

1277
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,289
stubborn to come to the light you can

1278
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:59,769
see them struggling and dwindling and

1279
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:01,599
falling off I saw it a couple of years

1280
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:04,360
ago the people I knew that we're living

1281
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,759
right on that the edge but between the

1282
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,750
black and the white market like the what

1283
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,519
you'd call the gray market

1284
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:14,710
the more stores that opened up the

1285
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:18,129
harder it was to compete with them I

1286
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:21,579
mean the guy that had one strain for you

1287
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:24,548
in March come July would show up a seven

1288
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:28,990
by December there was a selection hash

1289
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:30,009
in his bag too and by January it was

1290
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,868
just too much of a [ __ ] hassle

1291
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,789
regardless of the selection because you

1292
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,349
could just go to a store and pick right

1293
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:37,778
like you never had to hang out and not

1294
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:40,269
seem like foot traffic or any of that

1295
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:42,338
meet somebody somewhere how much how

1296
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:45,368
many episodes of How It's Made would

1297
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:47,440
never have been watched if we could just

1298
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,028
buy weed in stores Deadliest Catch what

1299
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,980
I've never been viewed Yeah right

1300
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:52,358
viewership on a lot of [ __ ] would go way

1301
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,099
down if you didn't have to hang out with

1302
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:55,358
your weed dealer for two hours so you

1303
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:56,950
didn't seem like you were there buying

1304
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,440
wheat

1305
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:01,058
this dude's just really really bored and

1306
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,450
a lot of his friends come to visit for

1307
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:06,369
two hours at a chunk I guess yeah like

1308
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:07,659
it's just so much more convenient even

1309
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:10,210
when you get to the shop and you're like

1310
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:13,210
really that's the price [ __ ] taxes

1311
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:15,880
like you start wondering how much your

1312
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,048
time's worth like how many hours that I

1313
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,519
spend sitting on the couch listening to

1314
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:20,318
[ __ ] because I was there to buy a

1315
00:47:18,518 --> 00:47:22,118
bag of weed and that was the best weed

1316
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,858
in town yeah cuz every weed dealer wants

1317
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:31,298
to show you his new thing that he bought

1318
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:33,548
with your money but you did you redo man

1319
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:35,739

1336
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,788
this one time I got my wisdom teeth

1337
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:11,440
removed and they gave me vicodin then I

1338
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:12,849
took too many of them and I fell asleep

1339
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,190
watching Deadliest Catch okay that's

1340
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:18,039
like the main setup here I woke up in a

1341
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,450
dream that I would caught somebody

1342
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,859
trying to kill people on The Deadliest

1343
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:23,230
Catch boat and I murder

1344
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:24,489
him cuz he was trying to kill me and in

1345
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,778
self-defense I killed him on the [ __ ]

1346
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:27,369
cuz he killed everybody else on the boat

1347
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,170
but then I realized everybody on the

1348
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:30,430
boat is dead but me and they're gonna

1349
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,539
think I did this [ __ ] and I'm all

1350
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:32,858
covered in blood in the boats all

1351
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:34,778
covered in blood so I gotta get the [ __ ]

1352
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:36,068
out of here then I wake up and since I

1353
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:38,318
took too many vicodin before I fell

1354
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:39,699
asleep when I woke up I didn't really

1355
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,288
wake up I was still dreaming but I was

1356
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:43,028
physically sitting up in real life but

1357
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:45,278
in dream life I was still in my boat and

1358
00:48:43,028 --> 00:48:47,380
I saw blood all over my house and it

1359
00:48:45,278 --> 00:48:48,579
took me a good I don't really know but

1360
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,900
I'm gonna say like three or four minutes

1361
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:51,400
of like shaking my head around and

1362
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,200
walking around my bedroom going why is

1363
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,309
there blood everywhere what the [ __ ] is

1364
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,649
happening and then finally the blood

1365
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,630
faded away and I woke up don't too many

1366
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,670
of I don't do too many vicodin kids

1367
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,778
