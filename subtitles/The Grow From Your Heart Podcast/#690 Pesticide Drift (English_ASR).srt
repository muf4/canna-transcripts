00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,959
saying wow i apologize for going through

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,839
that intro super fast i smoked a strain

47
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,319
of some flowers of a strain called jack

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
tripper and it's got me going super fast

49
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,359
hopefully i can calm down and get this

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,479
together but my brain is speeding

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,438
through it uh jack tripper is a cross of

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,800
it is uh lemon skunk and jack the ripper

53
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,598
it's got a flavor of lemon candy and

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,520
spiciness and some dryer sheets in it my

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,519
favorite part is that it has just got my

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
brain to suspend and i'm going super

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,239
fast in here also something i noticed

58
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,559
most of the time when i smoke flowers my

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
mouth gets super dry my mouth my throat

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,318
my nose my eyes i get that dry

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,480
cottonmouth feeling that just crusty eye

62
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,318
feeling from smoking so much flour i do

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,399
not have that feeling at all from these

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,000
flowers it is quite the opposite my

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
mouth feels not to it sounds kind of

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
gross i got juicy mouth from smoking

67
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,839
those flowers it tasted so good that my

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,519
mouth is like watering thinking about

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
the lemon candy flowery spicy flavors

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
that came from it's like lemon candy

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,719
bubble gum dryer sheets there's a lot of

72
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,800
stuff lingering on my tongue right now i

73
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,400
really enjoy it i'm going to try to keep

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,480
myself together and do a good podcast

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
for you but heads up i was smoking some

76
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,439
good [ __ ] today all right let's jump

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,878
right into it i don't want to ramble too

78
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,199
much because that is definitely a

79
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,399
possibility in this episode i did say at

80
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,199
the beginning of the show that we were

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,800
going to talk about pesticide drift in

82
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,039
our outdoor gardens we are wrapping up

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
the outdoor season most folks in the

84
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,158
united states have wrapped up their

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,479
outdoor grow season if you have not

86
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,399
wrapped up you are a savage or a maniac

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
good luck but many people have wrapped

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
up their outdoor grows a lot of people

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
have gotten their outdoor grows tested

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,039
by a lab facility we're testing for

91
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,598
potency and we're posting testing for

92
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,439
terpene content also we're testing for

93
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,318
contamination we're testing for heavy

94
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,400
metals and the presence of pesticides

95
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,759
we're making some weird discoveries i

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,239
was having this conversation with some

97
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,560
friends in a discord server and then

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
just after that we had some flowers not

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
any of my flowers but a friend another

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
person that i associate with and outdoor

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
girl i was checking out a lot they

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,439
discovered that some of their flowers

103
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,199
are testing hot for pesticide exposure

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,280
now how is this happening because the

105
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,280
people i'm talking about never used any

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,719
spray applications in their garden

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
especially the products that they are

108
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,799
being uh tested positive for so they're

109
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
saying how did this happen there's only

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
one solution that i could come up with

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
somebody a neighboring garden must have

112
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,080
been applying illegal pesticides or

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,080
pesticides that were drifting into our

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
friend's garden now that is really

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
important to think about are you

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,239
applying a pesticide and this only works

117
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,079
for an outdoor garden if you're applying

118
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
indoors that shit's stuck indoors you'd

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
be very careful think about where you're

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
exhausting to but for the most part

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,039
you're just spraying indoors outdoors no

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
matter how big your garden if you're

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
using a three by three plot of land that

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,160
is yours and the neighbors are sharing

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
that land on the other side of that

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
imaginary fence that imaginary

127
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,039
borderline it is still your

128
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,279
responsibility if you've got acres and

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,439
acres it is still your responsibility to

130
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,679
control the products that you apply to

131
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,240
your garden if they drift and travel

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,400
outward it is our responsibility to be

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,680
responsible pesticide applicators if

134
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,679
you've been trained by the department of

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,959
ag if you've taken any training classes

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,959
if you're certified you probably

137
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,799
understand the importance of pesticide

138
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,478
drift many people may not understand

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,520
that so we were talking about it and

140
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,439
there were a lot of things that came to

141
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,918
my mind and i thought we could do a good

142
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,160
podcast about it so uh did your neighbor

143
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,918
contaminate your grow did you did you

144
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
contaminate your neighbors grow were the

145
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,478
first two questions that i wrote in my

146
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,399
notes

147
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,719
pesticide can drift when you are

148
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,239
spraying stuff if it is windy it can

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
travel to the grow next door it can

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,519
travel every direction it could travel

151
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,680
whichever direction the wind is going so

152
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,359
let's be careful when we're applying now

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
this doesn't only count in cannabis

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
crops you may have neighbors that are

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
using uh you may have a fruit and

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
vegetable crop next door you may have a

157
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
hemp crop you may have they may have a

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,439
pumpkin patch coming up right next door

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,879
think about what they're spraying what

160
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,800
they're using think about what you're

161
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,639
spraying and what you are using is it

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,199
going to have detrimental effects on

163
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
either side of the fence possibly four

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
sides of the fence maybe you got people

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,160
all around you that means you got at

166
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,000
least four people to think about other

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
than yourself when it comes to pesticide

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,319
applications let's be good neighbors

169
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,918
let's be a good community we're growing

170
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,599
cannabis and a lot of people already

171
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,959
have a little bit of a stigma for us a

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
lot of people were programmed and

173
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,839
trained that reefer madness cannabis is

174
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,519
the devil we're gonna smoke smoke a

175
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,038
little bit of weed and start raping

176
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,318
ladies and committing crimes and doing

177
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,318
all the worst [ __ ] you could think of

178
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
we're gonna become the devil it doesn't

179
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
happen that way but they think that so

180
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
let's try to be good neighbors we're

181
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
growing cannabis right next door to

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,039
people that may be afraid of us let's be

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,879
good neighbors let's not destroy their

184
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,639
crops because that is one more thing to

185
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,918
make them hate team cannabis let's try

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,439
to be their friends we'll talk more

187
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,519
about that a little bit here in the

188
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,439
future so are you spraying your

189
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,599
neighbors and another thing to think

190
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,839
about are your neighbors spraying or

191
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,639
treating and sending their pests your

192
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,638
way when you spray for a pest or treat

193
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,079
for a pest or a problem especially like

194
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
if you got spider mites or something

195
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,879
like that i'm just gonna pick spider

196
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
mites if you spray for spider mites

197
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,319
outdoors they're going that way in that

198
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,759
way and if your neighbors didn't spray

199
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
for spider mites they're gonna get

200
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
spider mites if you don't treat for

201
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,359
spider mites in some sort of way maybe

202
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
you sprayed maybe you got predators

203
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
maybe you got some sort of

204
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
electromagnetic mind control that you

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
can use to control spider mites when one

206
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,198
of you treats for bugs the bugs are

207
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
gonna go to the other yard they're just

208
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
gonna say oh this guy's sprayed for

209
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,840
spider mites let's just climb the fence

210
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,519
there's no fence or spider mites are

211
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,560
microscopic they're just going to travel

212
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,079
south they're going to go to the next

213
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,439
garden right over there because that

214
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,959
person didn't treat for bugs didn't

215
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,478
treat for spider mites so if one of you

216
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,000
is treating and one of you isn't they're

217
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,918
just going to move around and then when

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,959
your treatment wears off or your spray

219
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,079
wears off they're going to go to the

220
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,279
other garden and then the other guy's

221
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,439
going to spray they're going to keep

222
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,719
traveling around a great way to prevent

223
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,199
this would be

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
farmer unity why not go and meet your

225
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
neighbors why not go and talk to each

226
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,279
person around you growing and see how

227
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,400
you are handling pests i'm sure that in

228
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
a lot of agricultural

229
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,679
areas there are meetings people have

230
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,198
town meetings people get together in

231
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,879
small towns they like to gather and meet

232
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
maybe a church maybe somewhere like that

233
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,000
bring it up say hey are you guys

234
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
treating there's nothing stopping you

235
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
from going and knocking on the door i

236
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,719
know maybe there is i don't know your

237
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
situation uh farmers are different i

238
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
don't have a lot i'm gonna be straight

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,439
up i don't have a lot of farm life

240
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
experience i'm a city boy i'm an indoor

241
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,240
grower i actually contacted a farmer

242
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
friend and i said hey is there a

243
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,918
protocol for this and he said not really

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,439
so i guess the thing would to do would

245
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,198
be to go knock on their door or send

246
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
them a letter or contact them some way

247
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,360
they're people they're facing the same

248
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,360
challenges as you possibly if you went

249
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
over there and said hey last year i got

250
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
hit with spider mites real bad around

251
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
this time of year did you notice that as

252
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
well and they're gonna go well holy [ __ ]

253
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
so did i and you're gonna go well this

254
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
year i'm going to do this to treat the

255
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,959
spider mites what are you going to do

256
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,160
and they can say well that your

257
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,758
treatment was a good idea or maybe

258
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
they'll say you know my grandpappy

259
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
taught me that for 20 years we did this

260
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
and it worked you might learn some [ __ ]

261
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
you might teach some [ __ ] so don't be

262
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
afraid to make contact go over there

263
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,519
establish some friendships build a

264
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,839
relationship see what you guys are doing

265
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,439
and work together if not like i said you

266
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,759
could just be passing those problems

267
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
from farm to farm to farm if you've got

268
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,639
think about if you got four farms

269
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
meeting at a corner you got the four

270
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,399
corners they're gonna go from plot a to

271
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
plot b to plot c to plot d just in a

272
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
circle just gonna rotate if you guys

273
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,278
don't do something if you guys all team

274
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
up you'll kill all the pests all the

275
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,120
problems work together you can all have

276
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,639
successful outcomes then if one guy's

277
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,919
growing corn and one guy is growing

278
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,439
soybeans and one guy's growing in

279
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,439
something else and you're growing weed

280
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
you're gonna have free coin free corn

281
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
free soybeans free tomatoes all year

282
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,919
because you guys teamed up and helped

283
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,239
each other out then you got some new

284
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,838
smoking buddies things should work unity

285
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,839
is the way to do it you guys now when it

286
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
does come to treating outdoors for our

287
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
pests and preventing for pests my

288
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,720
favorite and most recommended method

289
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
would be the use of predator insects i

290
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,080
personally am not i said this before i'm

291
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,359
not experienced and well-versed in

292
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
outdoor growing i've done a little bit

293
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,639
of greenhouse growing i've done some

294
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,639
help in outdoor farms but i've never

295
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,399
been in charge of an outdoor grow to the

296
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,319
best of my knowledge from what i've seen

297
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,839
i think that predator bugs would be the

298
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,839
most useful uh avenue and mode of attack

299
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,040
i personally maybe i'm a big old hippie

300
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,399
i don't want to go spray a bunch of

301
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,079
stuff outside

302
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,399
not only am i going to spray the plants

303
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
i'm intending to spray but also possibly

304
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,399
i may over spray and spray the crop next

305
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,399
door and that will result in my friends

306
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,159
my neighbors having a pesticide exposure

307
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
they were not looking for if they're

308
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,519
growing if i'm growing one product and

309
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,759
they're growing another and i spray it

310
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,200
over here maybe the product i'm spraying

311
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,399
is not allowed to be sprayed on their

312
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
product maybe the product they're

313
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
spraying isn't allowed on my product and

314
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
now we're going to contaminate each

315
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
other's product and it has to be

316
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,278
destroyed and we lose our product for

317
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
the year so my favorite option would be

318
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,799
the predator bugs also when you spray

319
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,000
stuff what else are you destroying

320
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,919
you're not just hitting your plants

321
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,078
you're hitting the soil you're hitting

322
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,199
everything around then if any wildlife

323
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,439
passes through you're getting that

324
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
wildlife also which we may want to keep

325
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
the wildlife away but you should have

326
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,679
built a fence or whatever for that we

327
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
don't need to get animals bunnies [ __ ]

328
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,958
like that sick let's talk about the

329
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,639
bunnies and the chickens let's learn to

330
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,559
use those sort of things to our

331
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,000
advantage the chickens are around eating

332
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,599
all the small jumping critters i don't

333
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,078
know what the bunnies do like i said i'm

334
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,320
not a farm guy but let's learn to use

335
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,078
our natural uh buddies the chickens and

336
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
things like that to our advantage to

337
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,120
help take care of that grill maybe let

338
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
some chickens out there maybe one of

339
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,159
your farmer friends already has a bunch

340
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
of chickens next door maybe bring them

341
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,719
chickens through your crops to eat all

342
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
those grasshoppers that are trying to

343
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
take over like i'm saying if we use our

344
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,559
resources and team up together we could

345
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,919
definitely make things better this

346
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,000
applies

347
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,399
side rant hippie talk i told you i'm hi

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
this applies to just about everything in

349
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
life if we talk to the people around us

350
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
and say what's your goal what are we

351
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
trying to do instead of just doing it

352
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
all on our own and trying to [ __ ] do

353
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
everything maybe the person next to us

354
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
has a goal that lines up with ours and

355
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
we can help each other out and we can

356
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
all get there together and not leave

357
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
people behind not [ __ ] fail because

358
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,240
we didn't ask for help this works with

359
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
everything in life team up with the

360
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
people around you see who's got similar

361
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,759
goals see who has similar things in mind

362
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,359
let's work together and get each other

363
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,958
where we want to be that way nobody

364
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
struggles it's all a community the

365
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,399
community can be a community again all

366
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,919
the isolation all the quarantine that's

367
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,159
coming to an end let's be friends let's

368
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,000
be community again let's get together

369
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,439
try to love one another and feel all

370
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
right you guys i'm telling you that jack

371
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,240
tripper is some good [ __ ] now let me uh

372
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
segue into i wrote down protect the land

373
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,879
it sounds like hippie [ __ ] but it is all

374
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,639
of our responsibility that land is yours

375
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,639
ah maybe that portion of land is your

376
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,199
land this land is my land but guess what

377
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
for now in the future you're gonna die

378
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
i'm gonna die people are gonna have to

379
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,759
live on that land after us i've got a

380
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,679
child she hopefully one day not too far

381
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,600
too not too [ __ ] soon settle down kid

382
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,120
hopefully she has children one day

383
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,839
hopefully those children have children

384
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,360
we need safe healthy viable land for all

385
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,279
of our children so it's our

386
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,519
responsibility now to make sure that

387
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,439
that land is healthy when our children's

388
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
children's children are there to play in

389
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,680
that dirt to grow their food to grow

390
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,439
their ganja in that dirt also protect

391
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,159
the water i know that's just a side rant

392
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,160
but protect the water if you're growing

393
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,159
cannabis it is your responsibility to

394
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,078
protect the land and the water around

395
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,399
your grow think about it like i said

396
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,559
about the land it's not ours forever

397
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,919
that water is moving that water is yours

398
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,919
and that section but it's traveling

399
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,599
downstream and taking all the

400
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,399
destruction the contamination the

401
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,159
pollution

402
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,078
the bad vibes that you're doing to it

403
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,600
it's traveling downstream quit doing

404
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,000
that [ __ ] to the people downstream be a

405
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
good person love the water love the land

406
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
it will love you back i do believe that

407
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,240
it will take care of you if you love it

408
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
back now this does work us into a little

409
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
bit of a recap previously i've done an

410
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,399
episode about bud washing somebody asked

411
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
me will bud washing help with the

412
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,399
pesticide situation

413
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,040
possibly maybe that depends on what

414
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,278
pesticide was applied to the flower and

415
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,120
what stage how strong there are a lot of

416
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,519
contributing factors here

417
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
was it just a surface application is

418
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,799
what i want to call it if you applied

419
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
some sort of oil some hippie oil that

420
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,639
just landed on the surface of the leaf

421
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,680
and made that plant undesirable for

422
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,919
attacking pests or maybe a pathogen

423
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,000
if you applied something systemic that

424
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,759
got inside of the plant there is no

425
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,159
washing that out a product like

426
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,600
floramite or avid that's inside of your

427
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,360
plant you can't wash that out it's

428
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
moving around it's in the cellular part

429
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
of the plant there's no getting rid of

430
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
that that butt is going to test positive

431
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
for that whatever the main ingredient is

432
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
that is it will test positive for that

433
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,599
no matter what you do even with a bud

434
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,920
wash so bud washing will take off your

435
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,159
powdery mildew your bug poop it may take

436
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,159
off some of your lighter uh surface

437
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,399
sprayed type products but your systemic

438
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,319
stuff is inside of that plant and you

439
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
cannot get rid of it so bud washing may

440
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,278
help with some things but it's not going

441
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,199
to get rid of every pesticide that you

442
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,120
used now one more thing to talk about

443
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,719
when it comes to protecting our outdoor

444
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,679
grows and taking care of our neighbors

445
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,079
is pollen i see a lot of people growing

446
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,879
outdoors in the city in in the country

447
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,599
on farmland in urban areas

448
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,360
be very careful with your male plants if

449
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,839
you've got a male plant outside and it

450
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
starts to drop pollen the wind will take

451
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,399
that pollen for miles it can go a long

452
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,599
way depending on what's in the way if

453
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,120
you're in the city if you've got a big

454
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
city i've got buildings and houses and

455
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,720
trees and [ __ ] here that may block some

456
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
of that pollen from getting places but

457
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,639
if you're in a flat landed area with not

458
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,879
a lot of [ __ ] that pollen is going to

459
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,799
travel and it could go quite a ways it

460
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,639
could go very far there's there are

461
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,078
stories of pollen traveling miles i

462
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,159
don't know how true or real that is but

463
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,039
there are legends and stories of pollen

464
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,559
moving for miles so it can go aways it

465
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,559
can go quite a distance at least a

466
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,719
quarter mile so be very careful if

467
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,719
you're growing outdoors pay very close

468
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,879
attention to your plants look for males

469
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
get rid of those males very early if

470
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,120
you're going to do any breeding outdoors

471
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,479
be very careful really consider how far

472
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,759
that pollen will travel do you have

473
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
neighbors that are growing hemp or

474
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,838
cannabis you may mess up their entire

475
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,198
crop also if they're out there growing

476
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
hemp or cannabis and they miss their

477
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,799
males they're going to mess up your crop

478
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,440
too so be very careful learn how to

479
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,278
identify males it is best practice in my

480
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,360
opinion to put tested plants outdoors so

481
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,879
we don't put boys out there i understand

482
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
a lot of people are just plopping

483
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,559
thousands of seeds and hoping to find

484
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,240
the boys be very careful with that be

485
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,239
very diligent with your mail search

486
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,198
please please don't ruin other people's

487
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,639
crops with your stray pollen alright

488
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,559
