185
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,478
people said this episode is special for

186
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,399
some reason

187
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,839
uh people really liked that episode it's

188
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,159
gotten a lot of views

189
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,679
i'm not sure why i don't know what

190
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
happened or what i did

191
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
but uh it feels like there was some

192
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,038
magic in that show that people enjoyed

193
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,960
thank you i felt like i was having a

194
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,159
good time podcasting i just cut loose

195
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,918
and started talking

196
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
i kind of felt like i was in the pocket

197
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,439
again sometimes podcasting feels like

198
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
there's work sometimes it feels like it

199
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,639
just flows for that episode i was

200
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
in the [ __ ] pocket i was having a

201
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
good time uh this is kind of my zen zone

202
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,519
you guys

203
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,919
i got headphones on the world could be

204
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,439
crumbling about 15 feet away from me in

205
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,120
any direction and i probably wouldn't

206
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,918
notice it unless something loud comes

207
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
through this microphone

208
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,198
we got some filters and stuff cutting

209
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,038
out a lot of noise the world could

210
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,000
crumble this is my zen zone i'm here

211
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,560
helping the people

212
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
i've got a plan i got some strategery i

213
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
know what i'm thinking what i'm doing

214
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
you can't really interrupt this

215
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,879
uh so i'm in the zone when i'm doing the

216
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
podcast i felt like i got really back in

217
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,839
the zone

218
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,439
and i got back in the zone in this

219
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,399
episode i feel myself slipping into it i

220
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959

255
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,519

hours out of a day then editing and then

um i'm obviously [ __ ] stoned and the

301
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
question goes

302
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
that's real quick and simple they're

303
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,520
just four questions but they go

304
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,280
like this why a golden goat back cross

305
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,598
that's a very good question

306
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,278
why a golden goat back cross this gives

307
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,278
me a doorway to talk

308
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,479
a lot i'm gonna kick my feet up on this

309
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,320
part of the table here where it's real

310
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,519
comfy i'm gonna pull the mic to my face

311
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
we're gonna talk about a golden goat

312
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,839
back cross why a golden goat back cross

313
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
golden goat's really popular it's a

314
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
really popular strain

315
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
it kills it in a commercial environment

316
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
it kills it in a personal grow

317
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
it has a lot of recreational benefits

318
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,159
when i smoke golden go and golden goat

319
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,159
crosses

320
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,278

321
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,439
really nice

322

329
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,440
qualities to it

330
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
i can't i'm not a doctor i can't say

331

that it does this it's these

332
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,159
these statements have not been proven by

333
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,039
the fda but i've seen it

334
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,759
work well for migraines and headaches

335
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,519
and

336
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,759
women problems when the women are having

337
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,440
their uh their monthly problems the pain

338
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,958
it will help with that pain is what i'm

339
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,920
told i can't speak on experience in that

340
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,919
but i've seen it work

341
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,759
so golden goat grows well as a grower as

342
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,278
a breeder it breeds [ __ ]

343
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,958
fantastically with other things too it

344
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,759
gives everything better potency and more

345
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,439
vigor

346
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,278
so as a breeder it's great for breeding

347
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
as a grower it will pay the bills

348
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,000
it puts out good weight as a consumer

349
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,919
either medically or recreationally it is

350
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
very powerful very potent it does what

351
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,838
we need done so it's a very popular

352
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
strain for several oh and it's also

353
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
super photogenic and it smells [ __ ]

354
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
tremendous and it's got great bag appeal

355
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,439
so there's like 14 reasons why that

356
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
strain is amazing and it should be in a

357
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
lot of grows

358
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,759
so it got very popular here in colorado

359
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,360
around 2008 2009 maybe 2010

360
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,799
everybody wanted golden goat it just

361
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320
showed up out of nowhere

362
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,000
and it swept the whole [ __ ]

363
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
commercial scene because it was killing

364
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,159
it

365
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
somebody got it and when somebody gets a

366
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,439
clone like that uh we share it with our

367
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,799
friends we try to be we want all of our

368
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,800
friends to succeed as well in this

369
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,559
industry if we're in a commercial grow

370
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,078
we try to share so the clone got around

371
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,599
all the commercial girls got it

372
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,278
eventually i ended up with it that's

373
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
another part of the story let's talk

374
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,679
about why uh

375
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
how it got popular and then let's talk

376
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,399
about a couple of other things why a bat

377
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,799
cross

378
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,600
um so people got the clone it got

379
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,278
popular

380
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
people would come to colorado and smoke

381
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,559
golden go then they would go home

382
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,239
and want to grow weed and now they want

383
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,759
to grow golden goat

384
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
this is where the bat cross seeds are

385
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,519
going to come in the string got super

386
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,959
popular for several reasons

387
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
people wanted to grow it when they went

388
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,559
back home or maybe in other countries or

389
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,399
other places which will lead to why i

390
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
made the golden goat as well

391
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
now unfortunately golden goat is what is

392
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
known

393
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
was known as a clone only plan i've

394
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,039
touched on the phrase clone only before

395
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
here's a good opportunity

396
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,159
to ramble about clone only a clone only

397
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,399
means

398
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,078
that it's clone only the breeder of that

399
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,958
plant who i'm going to touch on that in

400
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,759
just a moment

401
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,639
mr dank a person named mr dank in topeka

402
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,679
kansas

403
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,399
made the golden go mr dank never

404
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,559
released

405
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,159
other seeds of the golden goat cross

406
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,719
there was a cross that happened

407
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,319
the seeds that came out were grown a

408
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
couple of those were selected some of

409
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,720
them were tossed i know that one of them

410
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,120
we know that one of them became the

411
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,639
golden goat so that's a clone only plant

412
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
called the golden goat here is the

413
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,600
golden goat

414
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
the specific selected plant the breeder

415
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,920
cut the one that that person chose

416
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,359
it is right here it is golden goat there

417
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,719
was another one i think it was named

418
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,519
funky [ __ ] i don't know what happened

419
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
to that one

420
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,799
but it came out of the same batch to the

421
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
best of my knowledge i could be wrong if

422
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,479
anybody has updates data info

423
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
please send that to my email at grow

424
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
from your heart at hotmail.com if

425
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
anyone's connected with mr dank put me

426
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,600
in touch i'd like to know more of the

427
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
story

428
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
um just because that's part of my job i

429
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
am kind of the historian here

430
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,799
um so the golden goat it is clone only

431
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,838
now there were no seeds released there

432
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,559
were no other plants

433
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,279
released just that clone which means

434
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,159
there's no way to make seeds of it

435
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,240
because we need a male plant you can't

436
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,240
make you can't make something

437
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,159
you can't make more of something without

438
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,399
a male and female of that

439
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,240
if we were to cross that golden goat

440
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,679
with something to make seeds of it

441
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
it would be adulterating it the

442
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,159
subsequent cross will not be

443
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,000
pure golden goat it will be golden goat

444
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,559
crossed to a male plant

445
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
to make seeds so this is where the bat

446
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,078
cross idea comes in people want seeds

447
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,759
but for some reason

448
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,120
i know the re there are several reasons

449
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,679
we don't need to touch on those reasons

450
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,278
right now

451
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,799
there are several reasons why people do

452
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,600
not trust believe

453
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,120
or even want to mess with feminized

454
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
seeds i offer golden goat and a

455
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,720
feminized seed

456
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
which means i did not adulterate or

457
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,160
change the or alter

458
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,919
that plant that golden goat plant in any

459
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,439
way it is golden goat two pure golden

460
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,199
goat i've talked about feminized seeds

461
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
in a lot of other episodes

462
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,879
i took a golden goat female and another

463
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,759
golden goat female i treated one with a

464
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,078
solution

465
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,759
that solution made the golden goat turn

466
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,159
into it made it create pollen sacks

467
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,319
which only contain female pollen to be

468
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,240
quite brief about it i put that female

469
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
pollen on the other female golden goat

470
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
we have now made

471
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,719
all female all golden goat seeds it's

472
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
what they would say

473
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,879
all og dead stock golden goat that's the

474
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,839
sneaker head joke but some of you will

475
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,439
get it with me

476
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,839
now some people don't like feminized

477
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,680
seeds they have misinformation or

478
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,000
have had bad experiences and that comes

479
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,759
from past breeders back in the day not

480
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
doing femme seeds correctly not having

481
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,958
good morals

482
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,320
we've come a long way since those days

483
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,239
so now we know how to make i know how to

484
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,680
make quality feminized seeds i test them

485
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,799
i do a good job that's another ramble

486
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,719
for another day

487
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,078
so people don't like femmes so they want

488
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,278
the golden goat but they don't want

489
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,439
feminized seeds

490
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,799
but it's only a clone plant so we've got

491
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
to do something to make

492
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,919
golden goat seeds the way to do this is

493
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,519
bat cross this is where bat cross comes

494
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,120
in that's [ __ ] six minutes of talking

495
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
to get to the point but

496
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,039
welcome to the show you've never been

497
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,879
here before have you um anyway

498
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,559
golden goat back cross why back cross

499
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,240
because there's no mail to make the

500
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,359
original people don't want films we got

501
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
to go another route

502
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,039
i've got the original female let's make

503
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
a bat cross it's gonna take some work

504
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,958
but we can make some seeds that come out

505
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
very close to the original golden goat

506
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,399
and that's gonna be a bat cross i've got

507
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
the female so i know what i'm looking

508
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,799
for i've got this girl i know how she

509
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
grows

510
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,838
i know what the leaves are shaped like i

511
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
know how she smells i know how she

512
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,600
responds to light nutrients

513
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
manipulation of all different types i

514
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,278
can bender twister popper pull leaves

515
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,799
off i know how this plant responds

516
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,120
i've been working with this plant since

517
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,799
probably i'm gonna be generous and say

518
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,078
2008. uh no i'm gonna

519
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,159
i'm gonna be what's the other word uh

520
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,359
modest and say 2010

521
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,600
that's the one i'm looking for i'm going

522
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,879
to be modest and say 2010 generous would

523
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
be 2008.

524
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,879
so i've had this plan for years we're in

525
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,199
2021 at the time of this recording

526
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,000
halfway through uh tomorrow will be the

527
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,958
first

528
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
of the halfway point so um i want to

529
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,039
make

530
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,800
i want to make [ __ ] seeds out of this

531
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,078
i'm back on track and my brain got lost

532
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,519
for a minute to be honest with you

533
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,198
so i've got the female i know what she

534
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,720
looks like to make

535
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:17,439
a bat cross i decided

536
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
to find a male plant that was completely

537
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
different than the golden goat

538
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
completely different than the golden

539
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,639
goat why because i'm going to pollinate

540
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,480
the golden goat with this male plant and

541
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,919
it's going to make seeds

542
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
now that is going to be a i used a

543
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,559
daybreaker plant daybreaker was the

544
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,879
complete

545
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,119
opposite of the golden goat golden goat

546
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,600
kind of had these long skinny leaves

547
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,278
it made tall skinny buds the daybreaker

548
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,159
made like these golf balls

549
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,559
on long skinny stems uh i knew that it

550
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,278
would be a just a really different cross

551
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,879
so i crossed those and i knew that i

552
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,120
would be able to see

553
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,278
the golden goat looking phenotypes that

554
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,360
came out of the progeny the offspring of

555
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,000
those two being crossed i took the

556
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,919
tall skinny plant with the skinny leaves

557
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,799
and the short squatty plant with the big

558
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,039
wide leaves

559
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,519
and i crossed that and then i could tell

560
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,679
when the seeds grew later i could tell

561
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,278
which seeds had the big giant leaves in

562
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,078
which seeds had the little skinny golden

563
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,759
goat leaves

564
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,758
so if it showed me that it looked like

565
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
the daybreaker at all if it had that big

566
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,240
fat leaf

567
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
i just got rid of it if it had the

568
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,198
skinny golden goat leaf

569
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,639
i kept it and i kept it a little longer

570
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,799
and saw how it grew

571
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
if it showed me that it was a girl i got

572
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,519
rid of it i got a golden goat girl

573
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,198
already i don't need that i'm looking

574
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,720
for a golden goat male

575
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,319
so i went through a few seeds i don't

576
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
even remember exactly how many there

577
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,920
were a lot of them

578
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,000
i went through seeds until i found a

579
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,838
male plant out of that batch of seeds it

580
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,278
was the original golden goat pollinated

581
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
by a daybreaker male

582
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,278
i took seeds i grew out a bunch of seeds

583
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,079
i found a boy plant

584
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,600
that mirrored the female original golden

585
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,078
goat plant the original

586
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,839
female looks just like this boy when i

587
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,198
rub the stems and smell my fingers i

588
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
can't tell a difference

589
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,479
i would pull leaves off of both plants

590
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,958
and held them hold them up next to each

591
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
other

592
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,479
the shapes of the leaves were exactly

593
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,919
the same the serrations of the leaves

594
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,279
are the same the veins up the leaves

595
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,519
were the same

596
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,038
golden goat has a very distinct growth

597
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,639
pattern once you grow her a couple of

598
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,519
times and you find the phenotype i'm

599
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,959
talking about

600
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,119
or if you've grown the clone only

601
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,919
version you will definitely see that

602
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,239
distinct growth pattern she almost does

603
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,759
it

604
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
almost looks like a twisting she's

605
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,519
almost trying to make more branches more

606
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,038
space she wants to grow more

607
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,119
the leaves come out kind of weird at

608
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,318
first when she goes into flowers she

609
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,279
looks a little bit strange

610
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,359
as she transitions uh you will see that

611
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,480
uh where am i what was i saying

612
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,479
uh golden goat um

613
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,558
oh it looks just it matches sorry i'm

614
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,400
[ __ ] i got stone it got lost

615
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,918
uh it matches it looks it does the same

616
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,038
transition it does the same twisting i'm

617
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,640
not even gonna edit that i'm gonna leave

618
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,160
that in there i'm telling you guys i got

619
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
a [ __ ] stone before this episode

620
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
and i'm just in the flow uh so it does

621
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,038
the same twisting it does the same thing

622
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,558
at the start of flower

623
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,319
it looks just like the original female

624
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,480
so i got the boy that looks just like

625
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,599
the original female now the step now

626
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,279
is to take that male plant and pollinate

627
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,359
that male plant that looks just like

628
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,319
golden goat and pollinate the original

629
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,798
golden goat

630
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,480
now this plant over here the male is

631
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,798
fifty percent golden goat

632
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,839
and fifty percent daybreaker but from my

633
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,480
selection

634
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,678
i think i chose a plant that is probably

635
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,679
75

636
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,280
70 i'm gonna say 75 to 85 percent maybe

637
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
70 to 80 percent

638
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,440
golden goat it is a 50 50 cross but i

639
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
chose one that kind of

640
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
with genetics there's a phenotype that

641
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,240
leans a little bit more toward one

642
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,918
parent just like if

643
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,599
uh you got brothers and sisters one

644
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
looks more like mom one looks more like

645
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,558
dad

646
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,918
i found one that looked more like mom so

647
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,359
this one probably 70

648
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,440
75 golden go 25 daybreaker

649
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,839
i pollinate the original golden goat now

650
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,880
you're going like 75 to 100 percent

651
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,000
i think in my experience from what i'm

652
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,000
looking at through

653
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
test growers through product through

654
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,200
consumer grows through micros

655
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,839
these golden goat bat cross ones are

656
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,279
producing

657
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:05,199
about 70 to 80 percent reliable golden

658
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,519
goat looking phenotypes maybe a little

659
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,720
more maybe about 82 percent

660
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,319
if i did it again i would find so that

661
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,519
is a golden goat back cross let me uh

662
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,879
let me stop right here and then we'll

663
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,839
talk about doing it again

664
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,320
so i took the uh the gold the daybreaker

665
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,720
male

666
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,359
pollinated the golden goat found a male

667
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,319
that looks

668
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,839
just like golden goat and re-pollinated

669
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,839
a golden goat again

670
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,759
and grew up grew out those seeds which

671
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,159
are the golden goat bat cross

672
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,519
number one now i want to find a male out

673
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,080
of that that looks

674
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,519
just like the golden goat again and hit

675
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,879
the goal and go with that again and

676
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,319
that'll be a back cross

677
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,120
2 which should come out 83

678
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,119
to 89 percent it's a mathematical

679
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,038
equation but it also depends on my

680
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,759
selection that i choose the appropriate

681
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,519
males

682
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,200
for each back cross because if i don't

683
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,200
choose the appropriate male

684
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
none of it will go correctly i've got to

685
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,558
choose the male it's

686
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,319
the eye for breeding the eye for detail

687
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,480
the relationship with the plant

688
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,399
so then i just keep doing that i keep

689
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
finding a male plant out of the mix of

690
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
new seeds and re-pollinating that

691
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
original female

692
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,919
and if i do my selection properly every

693
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,319
time i do that with each bat cross it

694
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,640
gets closer and closer and closer

695
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,079
to the original golden goat the first

696
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
one was

697
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,119
very successful in my opinion i think in

698
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,199
my selection

699
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
process i chose the right mail that gave

700
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,679
me uh building blocks for success i

701
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,558
really set myself up for success

702
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,200
having 80 phenotypes that look like the

703
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,119
goal

704
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,440
is huge success in my opinion the next

705
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,199
time i do it it's going to be 82

706
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,960
85 87 that's a lot of percentage that's

707
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
looking like the goal on the second

708
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,279
attempt

709
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,359
and we're getting really close to 100 i

710
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,279
don't think i don't know that i can get

711
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,119
to 100 in genetics i think that there's

712
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,798
always going to be some uniformity

713
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,558
the trick to getting to 100 is running

714
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,240
larger numbers so that your variables

715
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,119
don't show up as often your mutants and

716
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,359
your strange

717
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,798
uh your uh your anomalies don't pop up

718
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,639
as randomly that's one of the keys to

719
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,558
getting better numbers but

720
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
i'm going to get back on track here so

721
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,678
uh the question was why golden goat bat

722
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,759
cross because

723
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,679
there is no male of the golden goat to

724
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,319
make more golden goat plants

725
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,320
so therefore it is a clone only it could

726
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,000
be feminized but a lot of people are not

727
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,798
into the feminized seeds because of

728
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,359
old breeding techniques uh myths rumors

729
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,440
misconceptions around feminized seeds

730
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,678
and bat cross because that's the only

731
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
way to make seeds out of it

732
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,280
how to do it i think i explained that

733
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
cross it with something

734
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,440
adulterate it as the word there then

735
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,199
kind of wash out what you've adulterated

736
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,798
it with you've got to breed that part

737
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,679
out if you do your selection properly it

738
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,759
only takes

739
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,280
a couple of times um i want to give a

740
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,319
shout out to my buddy pete we call him

741
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,599
f1 pete

742
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,839
uh pl grow pete uh one bad [ __ ]

743
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,879
p

744
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,240
p what's up bro not only are you um

745
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,679
a great person in the community i think

746
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
you're a good friend bro you're my

747
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,400
friend i'm not gonna get all gushy here

748
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,960
on the show but pete's my friend

749
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,880
and i learn a lot from pete pete uh is

750
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,600
very intelligent pete is forward

751
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,600
thinking

752
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,879
pete is uh pete's [ __ ] smarter than

753
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,639
me to be quite frank

754
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,559
and pete teaches me a lot and i'm going

755
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
to go ahead and give pete credit for

756
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,720
what i'm about to say i've been labeling

757
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,400
the cannabis community has been labeling

758
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,759
back crosses as a bx we say bx1 bx2

759
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
it sounds good it rolls off the tongue

760
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,240
nice it looks good on a package

761
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,480
uh pete's right when he says that bat

762
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,359
cross should be labeled bc that's a back

763
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
cross but the reason i always thought bx

764
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,519
look good is because you do like strain

765
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,120
a

766
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,960
x strain two like you're doing [ __ ]

767
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,639
algebra here it's this one times this

768
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
one and i don't like to say times i say

769
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
two or

770
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
crossed or something i don't even know

771
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
what i say naturally anymore i say so

772
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,839
many things

773
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,038
uh but um it just looks like x you got

774
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,439
the x in there so it's like

775
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
back crossed because we would always say

776
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,000
like a rise cross two

777
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,440
strawberry fields or something or ninja

778
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,640
turtles cross two gi

779
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
joe and so uh back cross cross is in

780
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,038
there so

781
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
just we were saying it back cross but

782
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,599
pete's right bro bc bat cross bc one

783
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,798
back cross one bc2

784
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,158
bat cross two don't get misled by

785
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,119
labeling don't get too caught up by

786
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,640
labeling but also

787
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,239
those labels are really important so if

788
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
you're the one making the labels get

789
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
caught up in them and get them correct

790
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,558
please

791
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,599
um shout out to my buddy pete shout out

792
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,678
to pete all right

793
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,798
um there are more questions how long

794
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
have i been going

795
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,639
um you know i think i'm going to quit

796
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,240
while i'm ahead because there are

797
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
let's tell the story of golden goat as

798
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,440
the next question on here and then we'll

799
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,038
cover the next two questions in the next

800
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
episode after we do some camera

801
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,319
adjustments and we'll do two episodes

802
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,039
today we'll record two

803
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,558
see if we can get this [ __ ] correct um

804
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,919
what is the story of golden go

805
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,279
i tried to wet my lips and i think i

806
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,880
licked the mic i'm not even gonna edit

807
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,440
that out i'm human you guys i do a lot

808
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,360
of weird [ __ ] especially on this episode

809
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,440
um uh sorry a golden goat so golden goat

810
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,319
to the best of my knowledge was created

811
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,640
on accident by a guy known as mr dank

812
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,038
who was in topeka kansas it was an

813
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
island sweet skunk hawaiian sativa

814
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,960
plant pollen it knows hawaiian sweet

815
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,798
skunk and romulan plant

816
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,278
okay the three ingredients are hawaiian

817
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,200
sweet skunk island sativa and romulan

818
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,640
my brain is [ __ ] blocking me on which

819
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
order that went in

820
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
uh one of those plants accidentally

821
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
pollinated the hawaiian squid

822
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,918
sweet skunk no hawaiian sativa to

823
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,679
romulan was pollinated

824
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,679
let's just google it we have a googler

825
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,240
right here

826
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,720
to the hawaiian sativa ii romulan so it

827
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,679
was a hawaiian sativa to romulan plant

828
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,679
was the male uh hawaiian sativa crossed

829
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,759
romulans it was a romulan boy pollinated

830
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,480
hawaiian sativa that became a plant

831
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,200
then that accidentally accidentally

832
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,038
pollinated

833
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
an island sweet skunk plant so it was an

834
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,798
accidental pollination

835
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,919
so mr dank had an accidental pollination

836
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,558
in his garden

837
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
uh then that made the golden goat those

838
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,599
seeds were allowed to continue allowed

839
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
to pollinate allowed to finish allowed

840
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,199
to uh

841
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,600
maturate mature rise to finish whatever

842
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
dude they were done they hardened up bro

843
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,399
um then those seeds were taken out of

844
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
the plant they were harvested and mr

845
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,320
dink apparently grew them

846
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,278
one of the seeds he grew became the

847
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,960
golden goat

848
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,880
that golden goat passed the [ __ ]

849
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,679
standards it was a champion so it became

850
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,278
popular

851
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,960
that's the story of where the golden

852
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,278
goat came from

853
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
uh the reason it was named golden goat

854
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,960
is because in topeka kansas

855
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,798
there is a recycling center that

856
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,000
recycles soda cans

857
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,879
and mr dank thought that the uh golden

858
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,440
goat plant

859
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,520
smelled like the sticky sweet syrupy

860
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
smells of the golden goat recycling

861
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,519
center in the middle of the summer in

862
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
topeka kansas in topeka

863
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,639
it is like hot and sticky i lived in

864
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,558
lawrence for a little while we used to

865
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,960
go to topeka to cause trouble

866
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,759
um it was gross it was kind of sticky

867
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
and funky

868
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,278
and i'm sure that if there was a

869
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,640
recycling center with sticky syrup in

870
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,079
the air you would smell it for a while

871
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
and probably smell quite delicious

872
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,319
in that hot sun that sticky sweet soda

873
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
flavor i could smell it right now i can

874
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,079
smell the golden goat

875
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,918
just permeating my brain right now so

876
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,558
that's where the name came from is

877
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,000
accidentally made by mr dank in topeka

878
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,759
kansas who was named because of the

879
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,960
golden goat recycling center

880
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,879
now here's something i really want to

881
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,440
touch on um

882
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,640
this plant was an accident so

883
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,400
technically

884
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
like if you really wanted to find a name

885
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
for it this wasn't a breeding project to

886
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,440
the best of my knowledge this wasn't

887
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,480
done on purpose

888
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
this would be bag seed right this is

889
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,679
what this is the kind of seed

890
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,759
if this breeder didn't realize there

891
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,559
were seeds in there he cut down his crop

892
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,319
he dried it

893
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,839
he cured it he put it out to market like

894
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,399
a lot of people do when you found the

895
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,240
bag

896
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
or the seed in one of your buds you put

897
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,798
it you put in your grinder

898
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,079
you give it a twist and you feel that

899
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,359
little what is that and you open it up

900
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,079
there's a [ __ ] couple of seeds in

901
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,759
there

902
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,079
that would be considered bag seed if you

903
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,359
had grown this and you found this plant

904
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,119
and you had the bright idea to call it

905
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,319
golden goat also you would have been

906
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,519
growing bag seed

907
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,519
and you would have found one of the

908
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,359
champion [ __ ] plants one of the best

909
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,240
plants on the planet in my opinion it

910
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,399
breeds well

911
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,798
i've bred a lot of [ __ ] to it i'm going

912
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,880
to continue to breed a lot of [ __ ] to it

913
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,240
but the person that uh would have found

914
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,080
this would have called it bag seed

915
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,159
luckily the breeder pulled it out of the

916
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,759
the plant or his own bag and it got

917
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,240
called something cool and it got spread

918
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,240
out as a clone only

919
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,679
it was bag seed though technically so my

920
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
point is

921
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,640
don't judge your bag seed by the cover

922
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,320
if the herb you got your seed from was

923
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,320
good or even if the herb you got your

924
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,038
bag seed from was mediocre you could

925
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,398
have

926
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,640
high high quality herb golden goat was

927
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,678
an

928
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,278
accident in my opinion gorilla glue was

929
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
probably an accident

930
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,720
um i think cookies was probably an

931
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,720
accident

932
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,399
the chem line all of the chem dog stuff

933
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,519
that we love we know

934
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:36,959
uh the chem 91 kem's sister chem d chem

935
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,319
four all of the chem dog crosses all of

936
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,159
the chem dog stuff

937
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,960
uh not the crosses but the chem dog the

938
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,520
original 13 seeds minus the males

939
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,159
came from what would be known as bag

940
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,798
seed

941
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,559
and chem dog is one of the best oh that

942
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,200
camera over there just gave up so

943
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,639
we'll see oh i didn't put on the auto

944
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
temp shut off i knew i messed something

945
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,360
up see you guys i'm glad i didn't rely

946
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
on that camera

947
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,639
um so we gotta switch the auto the heat

948
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
thing i'm gonna write that down heat

949
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
on the other one when that one hits 30

950
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,439
minutes or gets too hot it shuts the

951
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,079
[ __ ] off

952
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,320
uh so where the [ __ ] was i topeka kansas

953
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,558
bag seed clone only so a lot of those

954
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,960
strains were clone only the chem dog

955
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:17,519
stuff

956
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
all of the chem dog stuff was clone only

957
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,639
a lot of the popular stuff now or a lot

958
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,519
of the kem dog stuff i'm sorry i got

959
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,840
distracted

960
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,879
was from a bag see there were 13 seeds

961
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,480
that cam dog got

962
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,480
he grew a lot of them he found a lot of

963
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,839
gems and bag seed you guys

964
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,360
then a lot of those were bred to and

965
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,199
became a lot of the popular strains that

966
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,719
we were working with now a lot of this

967
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
skinky skinky that's stinky and skunky

968
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,079
[ __ ]

969
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,278
was from the chem dog lineage and that

970
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,240
is bag seed

971
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,759
so my point is uh one of my one of my

972
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,919
[ __ ] points today is

973
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,480
don't misjudge your bag seed you could

974
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,919
have amazing [ __ ] in that bag or you

975
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
could have complete trash

976
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,520
the key is that you grow it out you pay

977
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,038
attention you don't give it out to

978
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,480
somebody else and you know

979
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,759
that you're playing with fireworks you

980
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
could have something that's gonna blow

981
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,759
up at week nine to be fully herms

982
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,679
i could be a mess it could be a problem

983
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,519
it could be a full [ __ ] mutant

984
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,960
it might not even be worth putting in

985
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,599
your flower room you might discover that

986
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,000
early in veg or laden veg or

987
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,639
or just maybe or you could be growing

988
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,359
the next

989
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,840
golden goat the next chem dog you may

990
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,398
have just

991
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,879
created or discovered the next girl

992
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,398
scout

993
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,159
gorilla goat cookie chem whatever

994
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,719
magic you get to name it whatever you

995
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,080
want uh that is your brand new thing

996
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,440
that you just discovered just

997
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,879
when you talk about it just like no it's

998
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,159
a bag seed that i found here and i

999
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,440
called it this and i've been playing

1000
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,720
with it and growing it

1001
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,720
if you want to put clones of it out you

1002
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
can that is it's kind of it's your new

1003
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
thing so um

1004
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,919
yep that is the quick version of uh the

1005
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,159
golden goat story

1006
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,840
and that led me into talking about bag

1007
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,278
seed and clone only once again clone

1008
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,158
only it's clone only

1009
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,759
because there was never a male of that

1010
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,360
golden goat put out so nobody got to

1011
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,798
breed to it there were no seeds put out

1012
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,759
so nobody got to breed

1013
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,720
more of it i got the clone i made bat

1014
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,359
crosses of it

1015
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,000
i made fem seeds of it uh big shout out

1016
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,439
to my buddy

1017
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,720
uh we're gonna call him pineapple

1018
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
express i don't know if he listens to

1019
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
the show i don't know if he's still

1020
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,399
around

1021
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,319
town haven't heard from him in a minute

1022
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:12,719
uh he got married and had kids and kind

1023
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,240
of

1024
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,759
you know how people fall off the face of

1025
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
the earth he did one of those moves but

1026
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,720
big shout out my buddy pineapple express

1027
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
that is where that clone came from

1028
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,278
that's how i got the golden goat

1029
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,359
i think it originated from kind love um

1030
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,919
then i ended up with it from my friend

1031
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,038
uh pacalolo pineapple express yeah the

1032
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,360
dude's from hawaiian

1033
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,720
from hawaii he got a cliche nickname all

1034
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,240
right you guys that camera failing and

1035
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,839
dying over there distracted me

1036
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,519
uh the point of me doing this recording

1037
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,839
mainly was to see if i had the gear

1038
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,359
right

1039
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,439
i don't so i've got some adjustments to

1040
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,398
make i'm gonna edit this show out see

1041
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,000
how it came out and then i'll probably

1042
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,599
come back and edit another one after i

1043
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,359
fix the settings on that camera maybe

1044
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,959
swap lenses or something

1045
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,558
most of you don't even care about that

1046
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
part a lot of you like the behind the

1047
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,519
