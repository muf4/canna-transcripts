hear a lot of commercials but if you

92
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,360

00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,598
day he's like let's do a podcast dog and

97
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,280
so I said what do you uh want to talk

98
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,598
about and he said canopy management so

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,360
we're going to jump right into it that

100
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,479
was a good three minute intro I like it

101
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,280
I like it no Rambles no [ __ ] so

102
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,719
canopy management I've been watching

103
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,000
Spence follow uh a guy named Greenworks

104
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,519
on Instagram so a lot of this will be

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
inspired by our buddy Greenworks big

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,640
shout out shout out to the homie shout

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
out to the homie I choked when I said

108
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,518
that I guess I'm not allowed to say that

109
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,039
that was odd man so uh yeah shout out to

110
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,438
Greenworks he kind of inspired Spence to

111
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,479
set up some really killer uh cage like

112
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,878
uh not really cages the cages Holding On

113
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,238
Top do you want to explain how you did

114
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,239
it or do you want me to keep rambling

115
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,200
for you all right so it's essentially a

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,319
single plant scog to where you have

117
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,359
uh we use bigger pods Greenworks uses

118
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,759
27s I'm pretty sure something like that

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,959
I use right around 20s um so it's a 20

120
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,399
gallon pot I've seen them and they look

121
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,719
pretty big they're about 22 in around

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,439
about 18 in tall they're they're huge

123
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,519
maybe even more than 18 maybe about 24

124
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:23,079
in tall the plants the oh yeah the pots

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,120
are 2ot tall probably easy um but it's

126
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,038
just it's it works for what it is it's

127
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,120
all about you know working the surface

128
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:33,120
area you're giving especially like in

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,439
areas where they limit plant counts you

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,399
know what I'm saying that that that

131
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,600
could do a lot of things for

132
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,719
people I'm writing down the word surface

133
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,479
area CU that's a good thing to think

134
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
about we're going to go back to that so

135
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,399
yeah this for people with limited plant

136
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,839
counts in Colorado well in our location

137
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,120
they're definitely messing with plant

138
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,079
counts and uh we're not going to be able

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,519
to grow as many plants as we used to so

140
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,319
what Spence has done he's taken these

141
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,839
giant pots and he takes a plant and he

142
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,439
build a uh PVC sort of a frame around it

143
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,918
so it's he's got a square frame now

144
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,439
above the plant how big is that square

145
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,319
um anywhere from 4X it's a 4x4 Square

146
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,680
cage basically you build a a cage out of

147
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,759
your PVC and you do layers of Trail list

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,879
for support um you know some people do

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm not the only one that does it by the

150
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,800
way there's a lot of people now that are

151
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,919
that are trying it because it works I

152
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,240
mean it's it's more bang for your book

153
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,639
if you have you know especially it's in

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,038
my opinion it's strain dependent um you

155
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,840
can still get good yields but you'll get

156
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,079
better yields out of you know strains

157
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,439
that are built for that system Gorilla

158
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,478
Glue loves it loves it Bounty Killer

159
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,240
loves it you know what I'm saying so

160
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,159
like those moonshine Haze that Haze

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,038
plant loves to just grow all inside that

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,759
net so you know there's things like that

163
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,000
that works and cookies they'll do decent

164
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,879
but not like you know a gorilla glue

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,800
would do so essentially it's a you know

166
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,918
4x4 cage with you know multiple um

167
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,879
trellises and then you you know will

168
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,758
lollipop from the soil to the first

169
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,319
trellis you know so everything from that

170
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,600
first trellis up

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,720
will be just nugs naked okay yeah wow

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
all right so you got you got your frame

173
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,319
you got a square then you put a net over

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,598
and then you just got excuse me guys I'm

175
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,000
choked up from the dabs but then you

176
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,639
just got a bud going through each part

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
of the screen and you put another screen

178
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,560
on to support it and then if it gets out

179
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,079
of control because it's Gorilla Glue you

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,280
got to put another third screen up there

181
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,918
if you need to and and then but then

182
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,159
again it's more about you know canopy

183
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,478
management like making sure while it's

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,000
you know especially through the stretch

185
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:31,519
phase from day one of flower till day 21

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
22 when it's growing like crazy you'll

187
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,079
want to get in there and really like tie

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,598
them down make sure they're not growing

189
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,079
out of what they need to so it's you

190
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,038
know with those trellis Nets I think

191
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,359
they're like 3x3 squares or 4x4 squares

192
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,279
you know you want to try to essentially

193
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,240
get a nug or a cola to hit every single

194
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,519
one of those squares I mean there's I

195
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,240
don't know if there's 60 of them on a

196
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:57,159
plant so just you know the surface area

197
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,720
works okay wow okay so how uh early in

198
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,720
veg do you start manipulating the screen

199
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:07,199
so um typically what I do is I'll go

200
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,240
from um a one gon pot or a clone to a

201
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,038
one gallon and one gallon to a three and

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,360
I'll let that three kind of get bulky in

203
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,399
that three gallon and then straight into

204
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,800
the final pots and then give them you

205
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,159
know five six weeks Veg it's really not

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,439
as long as people think it is it's

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,960
especially when it's strain dependent

208
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,560
and strains grow you know faster than

209
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,758
other strains yeah and it's going to be

210
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,879
worth it in the end you're going to get

211
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,919
the weight in the end so once you you

212
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,599
know find your strain um that you want

213
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,000
to use you know you basically are

214
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,360
training it through the Nets you know

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,399
what I'm saying so if it's getting too

216
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
tall throw another trellis on it make it

217
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,038
go back under the trellis you know what

218
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,599
I'm saying keep bending it yeah you can

219
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,800
keep bending it what I like to do is I

220
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,000
like to just kind of on your first

221
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,840
screen you kind of spread it open and

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,079
then you let all the insides grow up and

223
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,359
everything on the outside's going to

224
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,639
grow okay around in the cage so all

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
those little shoots that would just be

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,800
cut off if you're lollipopping normally

227
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
you're going to grow into actual bra

228
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,520
yeah they're going to go straight up

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,120
into branches so with the Gorilla Glue

230
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,359
you're going to get long extended

231
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,158
branches out of those like I have

232
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,479
branches from like the bottom of the

233
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,439
stock that shoot clear up to the top

234
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,918
damn canopy management okay I I read an

235
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,319
article a long time ago that kind of

236
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,639
introduced me to this idea the article

237
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,360
was actually called growing on the grid

238
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,079
is what I think it was called and the uh

239
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,199
author was Eric bixa I'm going to Google

240
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,680
that just to make sure but uh he was

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,639
used to be a writer for high times and

242
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,759
he wrote an article about this I'm

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,759
searching his name while I talk

244
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,038
but I'm pretty sure that's it I want to

245
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,959
make sure because I want to give you

246
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,918
guys a reference yeah it's called

247
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,119
growing on the grid with Eric bixa it'll

248
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,478
kind of uh if you guys want to read more

249
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,560
about it this is kind of we're going to

250
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,040
give you the uh the in action in

251
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,278
practice sort of talk Eric bixa is he

252
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,159
writes a lot so he's going to give you a

253
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:49,360
really technical explanation on it

254
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,799
however I'm not sure how many times he's

255
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,959
done it Spence here has done it are you

256
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,879
messaging

257
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,278
Greenworks no we're going to try to get

258
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,439
Greenworks to call in one day and we'll

259
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,159
talk to him we've got I just actually

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,800
learned how to uh record quality phone

261
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,199
interviews using FaceTime uh I probably

262
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,439
can do it with Skype also I just haven't

263
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,000
experimented with that yet the other

264
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,600
night I opened up FaceTime and played

265
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,559
around and I'll be able to record so if

266
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,360
you guys want to be on the show and

267
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,359
you're far away FaceTime is now the way

268
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,440
to do it it'll be great Greenworks I'm

269
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,039
inviting you call us um speaking of

270
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,040
FaceTime I'm going to get uh I want to

271
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,000
talk about this guy in a couple of

272
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,439
minutes but I'll want talk more about

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,958
can canopy management but I have a phone

274
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,000
interview planned with a guy named soil

275
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,838
grown from Instagram we'll talk about

276
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,799
his Tech here pretty soon nice yeah so

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,360
you've got this uh 20 gallon pot full of

278
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,319
soil um you've got you said you go from

279
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,320
a clone cup into the 1gallon pot into

280
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,040
the three and then the three goes into

281
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,110
the 20 um do you top before you

282
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,439
transplant into the 20 at all

283
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,399
[Music]

284
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,880
um I I'm not really a big topper

285
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,278
depending on strain so like for the

286
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,240
system Gorilla Glue I don't it's a plant

287
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:59,720
to me some people do top it um but I'm

288
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,440
more of just a kind of you know working

289
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,879
it through the net so I'll take one

290
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,360
branch and take it all the way to the

291
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,240
left side and take this branch and take

292
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,680
it to the right side and eventually in

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
that system it's going to fill itself

294
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,838
back up W I didn't realize it would work

295
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,480
that extremely so if I've got like if I

296
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
took my whole arm and just bent it over

297
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,079
it's going to just make little shoots

298
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,120
and this is just going to be horizontal

299
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,599
for 4 feet across the room pretty or 2

300
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,278
feet from each room yeah so essentially

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,879
what you want to do is you you know as

302
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,120
your you know your colas grow your nod

303
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,838
stack uh vertically they grow together

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
up so if you were to bend that Branch

305
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,279
all the way down you're taking each one

306
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,000
of those Bud sights turning them up

307
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,919
which creates more Bud sights on that

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,600
plant than you would get stacking it

309
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,759
together okay so you're not going to you

310
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,040
may not get as many longas you won't get

311
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,399
like giant colas but you'll get a bunch

312
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,679
and it's all about the space because

313
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,759
we're not trying to grow concrete

314
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,799
underneath the plant we're trying to

315
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,759
grow all of the space for the plant all

316
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,000
right that makes pretty good sense uh so

317
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,120
you don't top it all that's see I would

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,440
have topped them that's why I would have

319
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
[ __ ] from the very beginning some

320
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,320
strains I do um Gorilla Glue is one of

321
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,159
the ones I it kind of grows that's wild

322
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
it grows by itself it'll grow with his

323
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,919
eyes closed yeah we're probably taunting

324
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,360
a lot of people because a lot of the

325
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,360
world can't get their hands on a gorilla

326
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,919
glue cut but there's there's you know

327
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,839
there's some things I would do um early

328
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,159
in veg you know cuz you give them a nice

329
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,160
you know five six week veg so a couple

330
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,799
two weeks worth of you know fimming and

331
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,480
you know training and stuff like that

332
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,078
and then you know kind of once say 3

333
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,039
weeks before flower you got to got to

334
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,599
let them heal up a little bit yeah yeah

335
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,958
at least two weeks 3 weeks quit messing

336
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,519
with them so that they know what to do

337
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,039
cuz they are apical dominant they want

338
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
to know which way is up still they got

339
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,958
to build up some

340
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,440
hormones all right um man I have like

341
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,199
seven questions in my head and I can't I

342
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
was like which ask a

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,200
question if it's not Gorilla Glue uh

344
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,000
what other strain do you like to

345
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,320
scrog let's see cuz I know you've got to

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,879
killer Arsenal have you done the White

347
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,200
Widow this way no no this this is my

348
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,399
first go at it so like and it looks

349
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,600
impressive for his first go I'm blown

350
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm blown away and it's I'm still

351
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,639
learning like the curve I'm still

352
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,360
picking up the curve which is you know

353
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,799
going from you know seven and 10 up to

354
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
20s and two plants that are two to three

355
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,278
times the size you know maintenance on

356
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,078
those plants like you always have to be

357
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,679
like cleaning up the bottoms and stuff

358
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:20,039
cuz imagine you know a 6ot plant that's

359
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,439
4 and 1/2 ft wide you know there's no

360
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,958
light underneath there so the things

361
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
like the leaves and stuff die off just

362
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,319
because they don't get light to survive

363
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,399
so you have to constantly be in there

364
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,320
picking them off um and things like that

365
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,240
it's a good thing to think about now I

366
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,519
like that you said that would have been

367
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,799
a six foot tall plant and that you've

368
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,839
gotten it down to four feet tall that

369
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,919
kind of puts it into a lot of

370
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,639
perspective for me yeah like my I'm

371
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,439
running gavitas in

372
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,839
a 9 foot ceiling room but it's all about

373
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,399
can you keep them down the light the

374
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,800
gavitas will work for you it's just all

375
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,039
about like in my opinion when you when

376
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,240
plants get tall and get close up to the

377
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,159
gavitas then they kind of feel how

378
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,919
powerful they are but when you get that

379
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,679
canopy yeah when you got that canopy

380
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,399
management all the way down you know

381
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
it's all about surface

382
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,320
area how do you have a prediction on how

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,559
much weight you're going to pull per

384
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,120
thousand watt light with this new system

385
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:15,518
well right now per th000 watt I'll

386
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:20,480
probably pull on my first

387
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,759
go probably 6 700 gram per Gorilla Glue

388
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
that's not bad at all that's over a

389
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,000
pound that's a pound and a quarter yeah

390
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:30,000
pound and a half if you're and if it

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,480
comes back right okay and that'll be

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,958
pound and a half with and it's only in a

393
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,759
4K I'm running a 4K gavitas and for a

394
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,119
six we veg that's not bad at all not at

395
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,039
all the plants really grow like when you

396
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,039
put them from a three gallon pot into a

397
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,439
plant a pot that's oh I've seen the

398
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,958
stocks of your plants and they're bigger

399
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
around than these microphones stand

400
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,838
they're almost as big as my arms and I'm

401
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,720

442
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,519
Spence and you want to take a dab with

443
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,079
roster Jeff in the garden of Weeden crew

444
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,000
um there's a good chance I will bring

445
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,758
some maybe not this big old setup but I

446
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,198
might bring some small recording gear I

447
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,720
just have a lot going on I don't want

448
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:17,319
this to disappear while I'm at the cup

449
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,639
or something like from the car or some

450
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,160
[ __ ] I get this is my livelihood so I'd

451
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,680
be crushed without it but uh this gear

452
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,399
some kind of recording gear may end up

453
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,198
at the can I've got my phone if nothing

454
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,480
else that works well but yeah let's do a

455
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:30,639
podcast or let's at least hang out at

456
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,879
the Cannabis Cup you guys and take some

457
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,240
dabs this show won't come out for uh

458
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,039
probably a week from it's tomorrow yeah

459
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
a week from tomorrow so yeah but they'll

460
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,480
have plenty of time it's just the middle

461
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,680
of March when this comes out let's meet

462
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
up to Canabis cup you guys let's take

463
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,758
some dabs I should have some uh Jeff OG

464
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,159
dabs if Spence is down to blast it for

465
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,879
me I'll let him do that no digity no

466
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,078
diggity let's do this all right where

467
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,360
were we we're talking about canopy

468
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,078
management I feel like we got a lot of

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,839
that covered um if you're not going to

470
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,479
do the scrags you can lollipop really

471
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,800
heavily that's another good way to make

472
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,199
space for what you've got uh kind of pay

473
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,359
attention get down on your knees and see

474
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,359
how far the light is getting into your

475
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,680
plants and when you don't see any light

476
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,159
hitting those leaves just clean that

477
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,120
[ __ ] off from the bottom there because

478
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,519
there's no light getting there it's

479
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,159
going to be a waste of space my op

480
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,240
there's also other ways of canopy

481
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,600
management like there's you can do

482
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,919
staking um I do lots of staking me too I

483
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,240
I honestly do both I I like the scrog

484
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,120
system but I still like the old school

485
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,959
you know State like look going in a room

486
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,120
and being 100 steaks deep in there and

487
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,838
it's like oh Lord that's how uh dread

488
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,360
over at River Rock does it if you walk

489
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,480
through there it's Stak Central those

490
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,199
guys got all the wood steak City yeah

491
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,199
yeah they got wood for days uh I like

492
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,799
some steaks I grow some i t I tend to

493
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,519
grow tall plants I use a seven gallon

494
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,919
pot and I veg them till they're about

495
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,278
three and a half ft tall so they end up

496
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,639
six feet tall by the end and that

497
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,679
requires either a T tomato cage or some

498
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,039
staking yeah I like the staking because

499
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,198
I can pull it apart and I can BR I can

500
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,919
support each Nug in a different area so

501
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,039
I can kind of do what you do you're just

502
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,479
surface area basically train it to like

503
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,199
this this cola's got this section this

504
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,880
cola's got this section you want to kind

505
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,160
of fill as many sections as you can yeah

506
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,079
yeah and if you think about what kind of

507
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,480
genetics you're using like we were

508
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,759
saying the Golden Goat or the Gorilla

509
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,919
Glue makes a whole bunch of heads M the

510
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,640
Golden Goat will make a whole bunch of

511
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,759
heads cookies doesn't really like to do

512
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,240
it so maybe grow a whole bunch of small

513
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,480
cookies plants like just if you can do a

514
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,439
bunch of twoot tall 3ft tall cookies

515
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
plants flower it yeah that's the way to

516
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,279
go with a plant like that just a sea of

517
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
green again G Kush just do a bunch of

518
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,678
small ones instead of one giant plant

519
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,519
it's all about the genetics and canopy

520
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,759
management I guess mhm yeah uh use a fan

521
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,400
you still need fans when you're doing

522
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,640
all this people forget about air flow we

523
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,759
can't stress enough about air flow

524
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,559
somebody was telling me they had powdery

525
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,038
Milo they couldn't figure out how to

526
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,558
beat it and they're asking what to spray

527
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,000
and I said Don't Spray something get a

528
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,639
dehumidifier and clean out the air in

529
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,480
your room so they're simple stuff cut

530
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,440
all that [ __ ] off if you can yeah cut

531
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,640
all that [ __ ] down if I see any bad [ __ ]

532
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,880
is going bye-bye bye-bye all right what

533
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,280
else you got about canopy management you

534
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,919
want to talk about something

535
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,158
different it's good 15

536
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,400
minutes uh canopy management um let's

537
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,360
see um what do you think about the

538
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,280
levels of your lights during flower to

539
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,519
help you know like in earlier do or the

540
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,960
first couple weeks of flower do you keep

541
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,000
them lower do you keep them further away

542
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640
you know I kind of my lights don't move

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
uh I start sometimes I'll put my plants

544
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,880
on a 5 gallon bucket to get them higher

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,759
but for the duration of the grow my PL

546
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,840
my lights don't move I'm tall and I hate

547
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,960
moving the lights down where I hit my

548
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,000
head on them I keep them as high as

549
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,558
they'll go in the rooms um one thing I

550
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,359
do is I don't change out from the

551
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,720
halides to the sodiums for the first two

552
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,759
weeks of flower you stay blue stay blue

553
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,079
yeah and they keeps them I feel like

554
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,038
they don't stretch as far and uh when I

555
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,720
do the switch I see them start to bulk

556
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,720
up right away at the two weeks instead

557
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,240
of doing that extra week yeah and I

558
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,640
really think that that helps and I have

559
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,359
stopped doing the V with blue lights

560
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,038
yeah okay so they're just used that

561
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,599
probably that change from Blue to HPS

562
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,480
kind of gives them

563
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,599
a time span they got to get used to that

564
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,120
[ __ ] real quick I do dark periods you

565
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,158
know before flower and I was about to

566
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,199
say I've stopped doing that I don't uh I

567
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,080
just don't find it useful really it

568
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,440
doesn't do anything I used to veg under

569
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,720
24 hours and then I would veg for 24 and

570
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,279
then go dark for 24 and then start my

571
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,000
flower and I noticed it would trigger a

572
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,960
little more quickly but yeah uh it's not

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,319
enough time to do anything I kind of

574
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
like let my plants do their thing for

575
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,839
some reason I just feel like when I go

576
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,558
cuz you know when so I go 18 18 to six

577
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,158
yeah that's what I'm doing into flow so

578
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,519
usually like when they sleep they're

579
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,799
ugly you know they're just sleeping you

580
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,079
know what I'm saying I'm not the

581
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,839
prettiest person when I'm asleep um and

582
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,158
then when they you know eventually when

583
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,879
the lights come back on they get into

584
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,600
the swing of things and then you know

585
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
before the lights cut cut off they'll

586
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:55,359
start going back down and then when I

587
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,798
usually hit that um I 48 Hours dark

588
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,678
they're as soon as I go in the rooms

589
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,599
even when it's dark they're already

590
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,080
praying and ready I feel like they're

591
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,558
just preparing themselves for the time

592
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,199
change yeah they excited for it yeah

593
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,558
it's crazy how like you the plants will

594
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,840
be veg looking and then that dark period

595
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:12,519
you go in there and it's like oh [ __ ]

596
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,720
they're

597
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,240
ready plants are these plants tell us

598
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,759
what they want that's for sure I like

599
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,359
that guys don't be afraid to try a

600
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,759
different light cycle my mother plants

601
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,959
run on a 195 cycle recommended by D or

602
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,640
is it 195 yeah 195 recommended by DJ

603
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,240
Short and that's the best performance

604
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,038
I've ever had from a mother plant so

605
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,279
don't be afraid to experiment with some

606
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,960
stuff uh now I do the uh I do 186 in my

607
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,279
veg areas and then my flower I just go

608
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,120
straight 1212 because I don't really uh

609
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,240
I don't do the all the dark period I

610
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:44,119
don't do I do 122 the dark period is the

611
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,679
only thing I do just start flower some

612
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,319
of the best her I've ever grown was

613
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,960
actually grown under a uh under a single

614
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,038
Hood in a 5x5 Hydro Hut with a 600 watt

615
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,759
uh high pressure sodium and a 400 wat

616
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,798
metal hly in the same bulb and that

617
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,119
Grilla bulb that hydrarm makes the

618
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,879
double bulb yeah yeah and I used one of

619
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,798
those I liked it that was great great

620
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,559
butd it had great flavor it looked great

621
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,480
some of my best pictures came from that

622
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,158
run of flow it was definitely quality

623

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,798
about but we're uh we've done enough on

644
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,639
it that's like 15 minutes we're going to

645
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,759
talk about some new

646
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,278

651
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,278
better than that

652
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,798
y'all the look on Spence's face proves

653
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:08,798
it I'm not sure that he knows where he

654
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,319
is right

655
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,879
now your eyes your hoodie and the

656
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,278
microphone cover are all the same shade

657
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720

660
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,400
[ __ ] it's called rosin Rosen Rosen Rosen

661
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,440
I've been calling it Rosen I've been

662
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,120
calling it Rosen I've been calling it

663
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,120
Rosen Rosen Rosen Rosen whichever way

664
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,439
you want to do do it uh it's spelled r o

665
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,119
i n so we can't argue that uh I saw it

666
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,480
first on Instagram from a dude named

667
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,879
soil called soil grown this dude uh what

668
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,079
do you think bro how do you feel about

669
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
it I don't want to give away too much of

670
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,480
his Tech because we're going to have him

671
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,039
here on the show pretty soon

672
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:53,079
um I will gladly support somebody trying

673
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:57,000
something new for sure like no doubts um

674
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:59,119
I was listening to Hash church today um

675
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,159
shout out to Hash Church check that out

676
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,959
don't like don't freak out on me cuz I

677
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,640
say this cuz people argue about it all

678
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,759
the time but it's the first

679
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,880
nonsolvent actual not there's not like

680
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,679
water as much as you don't you don't

681
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,400
believe it it's a solvent um and the

682
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,640
butane and propane those are all

683
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,679
solvents but he's just using pure heat

684
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,360
to extract oils there's no you can't use

685
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,640
heat as a solvent heat and pressure

686
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,879
that's pressure it's pretty impressive

687
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,080
did you see the picture of the SL like

688
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,960
the whole slab he posted oh no I the I

689
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,720
saw one it's like rolled up in a worm

690
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,880
around a car had a giant one it was big

691
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,919
as his face so like he's been going in

692
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,720
lately yeah I've got a scheduled phone

693
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,559
interview with him uh he said Tuesday or

694
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,079
Wednesday he hasn't confirmed a specific

695
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:42,558
time but we're going to talk to him I'll

696
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,240
probably just piece that right into this

697
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,000
episode you guys if I can get him to

698
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,640
call me on time that's all I need and

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,159
I'll throw that into this show probably

700
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,799
right here so here's an interview maybe

701
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,880
hopefully with soil grown how you doing

702
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,079
today bro great man I'm doing good cool

703
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,440
man thanks for pulling some time away

704
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,960
from your work to join

705
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,278
us yeah not a problem

706
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,400
uh dude I'm just gonna I know you're a

707
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:02,720
busy man I'm just going to get right to

708
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,360
it and start asking a couple of quick

709
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,798
questions first of all can you explain

710
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,119
to me a little bit about what rosent is

711
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:13,038
and how you got the

712
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:16,199
idea um well okay rmch I think that

713
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:19,200
comes from uh from somebody named

714
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,640
compassion that I guess was uh on IC

715
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,000
mag um he does a he does a robing tech

716
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,399
with like a no

717
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,038
melt uh hash you know so you take your

718
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,719
hash your no melt and you can turn it

719
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,558
into

720
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,480
M by pulling all the uh the resin out of

721
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,960
the no you know with a double boiler a

722
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,399
bowl and your no melt so uh so I did

723
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,240
this uh different

724
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:47,158
method um I rosin I guess what rosin is

725
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,319
is technically it's just a form of resin

726
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,278
obtained from like plants you know okay

727
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,798
that's where like I don't I don't know

728
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,240
why it's called rosin I mean it's

729
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,759
similar like rosin what I know rosin has

730
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,319
was like you know for boat strings for

731
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,319
friction

732
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,158
but uh I don't know where the term

733
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,919
actually stuck in cannabis but that's

734
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,039
where I know it from and it's really

735
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,278
kind of related to resin you know in a

736
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:16,440
way okay all right but um the way I got

737
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,839
my my idea I mean it came from basically

738
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm I'm a hash be you know so yeah I'm

739
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,158
GNA have my melt so I decide uh I need

740
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,038
to figure something out I have all this

741
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,240
snow melt and I remember back when uh

742
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,919
collected Nick put something on on uh

743
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,759
the IG about uh taking like a a flat

744
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,320
iron just for pressing you know just

745
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,640
press out your hash much simpler than

746
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,918
heating up a wand or you know doing

747
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
something like that you can get the

748
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,159
right temp just to press it out and have

749
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,519
a proper press

750
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,120
G well I used to take my uh wife's hair

751
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,480
crawler and I would uh sometimes I'd get

752
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,079
it too hot you know by accident I would

753
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,558
notice that it would separate you see

754
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,359
the oil and then the hash I wouldn't

755
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,079
think any this was like you know this

756
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,558
was a this was a while back so I didn't

757
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,798
think anything of it I would just pull

758
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,960
the parchment back up and now I have a

759
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,319
pressed Patty that was over pressed I

760
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,440
with too much sheat but uh otherwise it

761
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,000
was some press hash you know okay made

762
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,480
it smokeable made it better yeah you

763
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,640
know I made a little better how years

764
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,120
ago do you think that

765
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,799
was that was not too long ago maybe

766
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,119
about two years ago okay probably about

767
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,839
two years ago when I did that and then

768
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,599
uh yeah just doing like the FY teex

769
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,240
anything that didn't know I would triple

770
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,599
press it you know try to try to increase

771
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,278
the mou quality on it some stuff didn't

772
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,359
some stuff

773
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,119
did so what gave you the idea to just

774
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,240
start pressing straight buds without try

775
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,879
and hash in

776
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,319
there all right so uh so once I ran out

777
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,559
of my no melt all my no melt and turning

778
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,678
it into rosin and

779
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,158
smoking we just took I don't know we're

780
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,399
just sitting here smoking you know I'm

781
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,399
not I smoke flour but my thing is

782
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:59,359
dabbing I'm I'm oh yeah more the

783
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:02,359
extracts you know me too definitely

784
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,719
yeah so so we're just I'm sitting here

785
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,278
uh bullshitting with my uh

786
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,640
father-in-law and I'm like hey let's try

787
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,200
this I grabbed the nug he's like what

788
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,520
are you doing I put it in between the

789
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,038
parchment just like I would a h you know

790
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:19,679
a a rolled up ball a hash and uh my

791
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,798
surprise resin squeezed out of the bud

792
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,559
we were both in shock like no way so I

793
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,720
scooped up the oil did it again scooped

794
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,000
it up there was a little there was

795
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,319
enough on the end looked like dab so we

796
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,398
tried it

797
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,079
out and

798
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,639
uh and uh to my surprise you know melt

799
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:41,599
it to nothing nothing like no

800
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,799
residue and sometimes you get from even

801
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,918
good BHO will leave a residue sometimes

802
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,960
so that's impressive yeah yeah exactly

803
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,600
very sweet very [ __ ] cool man you got

804
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,880
lucky figuring that one out yeah I would

805
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,119
I would you know luck luck the way to

806
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,880
say it but uh I mean I just I'd say I'm

807
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,518
I mean if I didn't do it I did like if I

808
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,760
didn't sit here and smoke like I do

809
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,599
every day and I wasn't so much into the

810
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,158
to the concentrate aspect of cannabis

811
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,839
you I wouldn't be the one to respect the

812
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,080
Lu you know yeah man much respect for

813
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,398
putting in the work for putting in the

814
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,918
time to get to there and for loving that

815
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,599
the extracts as much as you do to find

816
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,679
that for us because it seems to be the

817
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:19,918
thing now bro you're blowing up on

818
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,679
Instagram yeah uh you know I didn't and

819
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
when I posted I really didn't expect it

820
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,600
I thought it'd be like you know

821
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,759
something some of these uh um hash

822
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,240
makers were like could could utilize for

823
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,960
all their the no notes and then once I

824
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,399
started posting up the flower I was just

825
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,640
thinking you know some people would be

826
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,479
like you know in awe about it but I

827
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,120
didn't expect that no way yeah bro can

828
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,399
you tell me just kind of a brief I know

829
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,678
it's just a pretty simple process can

830
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,798
you tell me kind of briefly how you do

831
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,360
it yeah I mean I would say it it's

832
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,918
probably the most simplest process of

833
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,599
extraction I would say uh I mean if you

834
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,720
want to do it the most basic way to do

835
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,158
it for anybody at home is just grab your

836
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,120
uh grab your lady's flat eye on your

837
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,320
hair straightener get the widest one you

838
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,839
can digital settings would be Optimum if

839
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,200
not I mean when I first did it I had it

840
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,599
up to

841
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,558
420° you roast buds yeah I mean the

842
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,599
Turin were I I I wasn't worried about uh

843
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,319
I was I wanted tur but I wanted that

844
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,079
melt you know so to my surprise I was

845
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,519
pulling melt out and now that I've

846
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,119
fine-tuned it a little bit and there's

847
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,278
going to be a lot more evolving to it

848
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,918
it's just in the beginning stage for

849
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,919
sure but uh you know it's fine tuning

850
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,679
and stuff you get those those turps out

851
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,799
of it but so you just get the uh the

852
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
straightening comb or the flat iron and

853
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,918
then just basically put some parchment

854
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,240
in there yeah so you put it between the

855
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,278
parchment and then uh put it between the

856
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,000
flat iron you want to do it in a quick

857
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,159
as fastest possible put it between the

858
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,038
flat iron and then press it as hard as

859
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,720
you can you know press it as hard as you

860
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:51,000
can for about I'd say one to two two to

861
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,919
three seconds depending like how hot you

862
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,960
got your your iron but you really you

863
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,159
hear it come out mostly it comes down to

864
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,880
trial and error and hearing that that

865
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,640
sound of knowing when to pull up and you

866
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,600
know knowing when you have it too hot

867
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,679
it's it's a lot of ear it really

868
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,119
is all right so I just got to practice

869
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,200
and waste a couple of buds but it

870
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,918
doesn't look like you're doing a lot of

871
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,480
buds at one time so that's not too big

872
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,519
of a deal to waste a couple

873
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,120
nuggets yeah yeah I don't do the the

874
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,960
hair straighten anymore I mean I do the

875
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,759
Press now yeah I see you doing big

876
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,679
things now yeah it's a little bigger you

877
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,200
know I'm still I have a lot of other

878
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,038
plans for for something uh make it more

879
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,640
efficient process but right now this

880
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,278
this seems to work it's if I can sign P

881
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,120
this to make it workable then whatever

882
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:37,880
goes on after it's just going to be

883
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,959
better there you go keep improving every

884
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,080
day that's the way this industry is

885
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,360
working so how are you doing are you

886
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,038
doing anything special to prepare the

887
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,558
buds do you like them a little moist you

888
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:46,558
like them dry do you like them crispy do

889
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:50,038
you like them

890
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:53,119
cured uh I'd say a properly grown well

891
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:56,798
cured but uh you mean that's how I would

892
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,158
look at it but that is too dry Works um

893
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,798
something that might have a little too

894
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,600
much moisture it probably will work I

895
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,240
haven't uh had too much like uh trial

896
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,959
with that I've had like fresh nugs and I

897
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,079
haven't had too many results with it uh

898
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,278
nothing nothing to to be ecstatic about

899
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,759
okay so it's better to let the moisture

900
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,079
come out a little bit let it dry

901
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,879
up and I don't know what how the

902
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,839
moisture is gonna affect the extract

903
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,639
whether we see it or not I I can't see

904
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,638
how it wouldn't you know moisture heat

905
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:30,158
and resin it's just somehow trapping in

906
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:33,240
there just like when you're pring some

907
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,720
not properly dried iwe you know you're

908
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,839
trapping moisture so I don't I can see

909
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,639
that being the same to this process all

910
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,439
right do uh do certain strains work

911
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,798
better do like indicas or sativas work

912
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,240
better or do you have a favorite strain

913
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,759
that works the best for make and rosin

914
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,960
uh right now I'm finding that indas are

915
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,000
are producing they have the most resin I

916
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,639
mean I've even had some real Frosty

917
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,880
sativas you only putting out like eight

918
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:05,839
9% but I've had some indicas P around I

919
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,278
mean anywhere from like 9 to 22% you

920
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,319
know wow that's impressive that's

921
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,919
getting up there with the the BHO

922
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,398
pools yeah I mean it really depends on

923
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,000
how much time and effort you want to put

924
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,239
into if you want to sit there and do it

925
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,759
as Point ons I mean you want to break

926
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,558
the the bud down if you're doing it in a

927
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,480
whole gram you're probably not going to

928
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,319
get the percentage you're looking

929
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,000
for on big scale it might suffice

930
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,480
because uh you're going to be how

931
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,599
efficient the process

932
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,720
but all right so break it up a little

933
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,278
bit or the more the more broken up the

934
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,960
better actually all right that's good to

935
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,359
know um does how does the flavor of a

936
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,759
Rosen dab compared to like a BHO dab or

937
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,558
a solventless dab are you still getting

938
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,919
good

939
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,759
flavors yeah H man it's it's

940
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,480
unbelievable I can't wait to send in

941
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,879
some of these samples for testing that

942
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,200
was be one of my next questions I was

943
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,799
gonna ask if you've had anything tested

944
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,840
or if anybody that you know has had it

945
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,398
tested yet yeah actually a foundation

946
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,918
extracts I think some somebody else had

947
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,719
some actually hash tested seemed like it

948
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,720
was pretty high in CBD okay I posted up

949
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,558
the results on my Ig page with the uh

950
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,319
the results from Foundation extract I

951
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:16,079
think it was like 83% THC and 8% turine

952
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,839
wow that's pretty man and I don't know

953
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,599
who I'm just guessing that it was made

954
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:26,240
off of a a hair straightener you know

955
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,558
okay so a little bit less uh control on

956
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,359
it have you seen any hatred from all the

957
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,759
BHO people the guys that spent thousands

958
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,678
of dollars on equipment and now you're

959
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,798
just doing it with a shirt

960
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,240
press uh yeah you know I've seen a

961
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,519
little bit of hate you know uh it's not

962
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,319
it's not bad some of it's more of like

963
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,038
on the down low some people are kind of

964
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,638
burnt and then most of the time D A lot

965
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:51,079
of people are just like just not giving

966
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:53,119
it a chance but then you know like I'll

967
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,199
see them I'll see some of these people

968
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,199
like changing their minds about it

969
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,480
they're trying it out once they try it

970
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,919
like can't knock it till you try it

971
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,038
right well that's how this industry is

972
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,519
though you know this industry is Cy they

973
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,839
make decisions right away yeah it is

974
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,358
you're right you're right it's just how

975
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,319
the way the world it's the way the world

976
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:11,918
works but you know when you do that

977
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,720
you're gonna be the one to miss out on

978
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,000
something like this that's truth guys if

979
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,239
you ever get a chance anybody that's

980
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,079
listening if you get a chance take a dab

981
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,759
of some rosin before you diss it try the

982
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,480
rosin Tech yourself don't don't be a

983
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,839
hater so bro are you be surprised there

984
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,838
you go how's the high is it similar to a

985
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,759
normal dab

986
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:35,039
yeah I'd say it's uh it's strong I would

987
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,960
compare it more to like uh iwe or like a

988
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,480
a hash daab rather than a b dab to me do

989
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,440
you get that heavy chested feeling like

990
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,000
you do sometimes from a water dab when

991
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,440
uh or an iwe dab do you get a that heavy

992
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,838
chested like thick feeling sometimes in

993
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,240
my opinion it's the smoothest dab nice

994
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,159
are you gonna be in Denver for the

995
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,479
Cannabis

996
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,760
Cup I'm still not 100% sure about the

997
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,119
the Denver cup but uh we're going to

998
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,960
most likely be in chalice this year all

999
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,440
right well if you were at the Denver cup

1000
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,358
you better find me I'm a tall white guy

1001
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,440
with dreadlocks I would love to Tech for

1002
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:12,239
sure we'll definitely link we'll make

1003
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,200
that worth our time do you think uh

1004
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,639
you're GNA enter any uh contest or any

1005
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,319
cups or anything like that anytime soon

1006
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:22,239
bro

1007
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,880
um I think the the next Cup going on is

1008
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,279
that we that we're going to enter is

1009
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,838
chalice we're setting up for we're

1010
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
starting to prepare for it nice you're

1011
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,000
going to put rosin Tech in there yeah

1012
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,160
definitely going to see some uh

1013
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,920
solventless he extracted oil

1014
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,000
um and then I'm hoping to have some ice

1015
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,519
wax in as well very cool I can't wait to

1016
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,719
see what the rosin Tech does up next to

1017
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,199
ice wax and also up next to BHO they'll

1018
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,358
probably make a category for it by the

1019
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:50,000
time that that the event happens but I'm

1020
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,039
still excited to see it competitions as

1021
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,519
far as I see I mean it's nonf I mean

1022
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,880
don't they throw the clear in that

1023
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,199

right up there with those guys I have

1027
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,239
faith in it from what I've seen people

1028
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,400
are loving it and the fact is you know

1029

there's it's there natural Tes whether

1030
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,160
it went through heat the process that I

1031
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,400
went just can't forget that it's

1032
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:17,318
solventless you know I'm not I'm not big

1033

but these guys are using [ __ ] that's

1143
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,079
around the house and handmade uh Adam

1144

Han from handmade app Peril he showed me

1145
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,760
his what he posted uh his slab because

1146
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,439
of course he had a t-shirt press already

1147
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,319
and he's like I got this game figured

1148
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,760
out and he's winning but I'm amazed that

1149
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:20,838
they're using [ __ ] that is just kind of

1150
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,200
around the house and making Earl you

1151

1153
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,119
actually I I lied I

1154
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,039
tried um but I think it has more

1155
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,559
something to do with the moistured

1156
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,559
content of how your weed is dried like

1157
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,799
weed down here is really dry so it's

1158
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,599
just maybe I needed to do more pressure

1159
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,800
or something like that it's just we'll

1160

you're working on going so uh right

1249
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,838
before you came over tonight I was at

1250
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:02,118
the GR space taken pictures of like 20

1251
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,159
different phenotypes of black cherry Kim

1252
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,358
and I've narrowed it down there's one

1253
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,399
that is definitely a breeder uh it's

1254
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:12,039
purple it's got the great bud structure

1255
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,559
it smells like uh purple Laffy Taffy

1256
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,800
it's got a weird and you can smell it

1257
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,119
from far away it's got a weird

1258
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
overpowering Aroma Laffy Taffy are SLA

1259
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,440
right I don't like great Laffy Taffy

1260
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,039
coincident I'm black and I don't like

1261
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,920
grapes sorry I wasn't going there um but

1262
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:32,318
I do like Laffy Taffy they sliming so

1263
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,240
that flavor yeah yeah and the smell too

1264
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,480
you can open a pack of Laffy Taffy and

1265
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,879
smell it before you even eat it and

1266
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,719
that's kind of how it is when I walked

1267
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,240
in the room and I I could smell that one

1268
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,318
plant all the time so I had to single it

1269
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,118
out I was like this little [ __ ] right

1270
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:44,800
here is going to be a winner and she

1271
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,280
happened to be one of the best purple

1272
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,359
phenotypes uh she grows a nice top Cola

1273
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,319
nice structure so I'm going to use that

1274
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,039
one and then there's one uh that's a

1275
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:55,480
little lighter purple but has more of a

1276
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,079
cam dog sort of a smell so that one's

1277
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,960

golden when I cross anything to Golden

1308
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,358
Goat it makes it more resiny and Gorilla
