start the show off by telling you what

26
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,058
I've been smoking on today I've been

27
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,909
taking dabs of guava papaya nectar from

28
00:00:54,058 --> 00:01:00,509
Green Dot labs this is Kim 4 and papaya

29
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:03,299
mixed together is labeled as sour fuel

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:06,030
and soft fruit flavors it's got sort of

31
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,459
a sour fuel and then there's a weird

32
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,260
like a green gummy bear or a green gummy

33
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,759
worm sort of a flavor to it I was

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,409
enjoying it it's got a nice rip and a

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,760
head height to it it's got me kind of

36
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,109
slowed down it feels like I feel like

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,368
I'm just kind of chilling like I could

38
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,140
be more hyper like I could use some

39
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,659
caffeine or something but the guava

40
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,269
papaya nectar from Green Dot labs tastes

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,299
great it's got me nice and stoned that's

42
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,798
what I'm dabbing on today and today I've

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,110
been dabbing in style because our

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,070
friends Adam ill and hem Perko sent me

45
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:37,500
the highest host collab gift box it's a

46
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,179
very cute collectible pink box it's got

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,280
Adam Hills face on it and it says what

48
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,829
all over the box because Adam L likes to

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,930
say what it's got some cool branding all

50
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,109
over the box and you open the box up you

51
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,790
are styled out and ready to dab there is

52
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,009
everything you need to dab inside this

53
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,299
box except some dabs and a torch other

54
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,909
than that you're pretty much ready to go

55
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,368
I busted the box open there is a rig

56
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,079
inside the box it's a very cute little

57
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,819
rig it's shaped like a cup it looks like

58
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,289
maybe a small cup that you'd get some

59
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,699
maybe if you ordered orange juice in at

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,530
McDonald's or something or some fast

61
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,179
food joint it's that style of a cup

62
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,890
shape it's got a straw coming out of it

63
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,990
for a mouthpiece the best part

64
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,239
is on the front part of the rig there is

65
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,409
a picture of my boy Adam ill he's just

66
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,450
looking at you you can see him going

67
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,099
what and then it says Adam he'll times

68
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,899
hamper on the bottom there it's got a

69
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,759
disc perk which was actually done in an

70
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,620
amber color and then the straw itself

71
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,849
was done in an amber color also I like

72
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,500
the way that the mouthpiece kind of

73
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,569
flares out I like those flirt out

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,400
mouthpieces great little rig from our

75
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,590
friends at Adam ill and hemp er CO and

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,319
then also they threw in a banger so it

77
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,150
came with a 14 millimeter banger a male

78
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,919
banger that fits right into the rig this

79
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,230
thing is super thick I'd hold heat

80
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,000
really well so pretty much all I needed

81
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,469
now was a torch and some dad's and I was

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,759
able to dab and of course I've got that

83
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,989
but wait there's more

84
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,039
they included a whole bunch of sweet

85
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,469
accessories I'm not gonna go over

86
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,879
everything but there's a pack of q-tips

87
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,530
in there to keep the new banger clean

88
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,859
and then one of my favorite things was

89
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,349
random there are some snap cap alcohol

90
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,790
swabs they've got alcohol q-tips so

91
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,829
they're a q-tip that you crack the tip

92
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,329
and then it becomes wet with alcohol

93
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,310
what so you know you've got some alcohol

94
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,469
so q-tips to clean your banger to help

95
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,030
clean your stuff up super helpful there

96
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,379
there were some papers in there there's

97
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,209
some stickers in there there's a

98
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,799
wristband with a stash pocket on the

99
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,409
back of it that's gonna be useful and

100
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,459
then also my favorite part there's an

101
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,900
atom ill air freshener for your car

102
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,000
there are a few other cool items in here

103
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,140
there's a silicone ashtray with a cone

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,539
in the middle of it so you can catch

105
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,738
your bowls on that there's a small torch

106
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,590

107
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,870
blunts there's a hemp lake in here there

108
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,370
are a couple other small accessories but

109
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,900
it's a really well put together package

110
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,189
I think this was well thought out and I

111
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,409
wanted to make sure to say thank you to

112

119
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,359
about before we get into the main topic

120
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,969
of this podcast a couple of episodes ago

121
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,640
I talked about my strain arise and I

122
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,949
requested my audience to go to Leafly

123
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,289
and help me get a rise posted on the

124
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,000
website Leafly Leafly is a website that

125
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,250
many people go to to find strain

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,870
recommendations they list a lot of

127
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,580
strains there you can click on the

128
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,709
strain you can read reviews from other

129
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,449
consumers you can see what it smokes

130
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,459
like you can see what the high is like

131
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,780
you can see how it smells and tastes you

132
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,699
can also click on the strain and get a

133
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,129
bunch of information about how it grows

134
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:29,228
about how it was bred Leafly is a great

135
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,029
resource for a lot of people who are new

136
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,978
to the cannabis industry and want to

137
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:35,109
discover new strains without having to

138
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,728
go to the dispensary and buy a gram of

139
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,259
everything so it's a good place for them

140
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,939
to find out what they're interested in

141
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,579
and what may get their attention and

142
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:44,978
also what may work for them medically so

143
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:48,819
I'm trying to get a rise listed on

144
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:50,680
Leafly com all I did was say hey guys go

145
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,779
do this for me and I gave vague

146
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,129
instructions on how to do so since then

147
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,859
I've gotten a couple of messages saying

148
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,240
hey dude how do I do this I've noticed

149
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,460
that it is hard to figure out where to

150
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,860
create a new strain review if you're not

151
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:05,259
familiar with Leafly so this is a brief

152
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,330
explanation on how to do a review on a

153
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,969
strain that does not exist on Leafly

154
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:11,978
these instructions are based on using

155
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,990
the website not the application I don't

156
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,469
have the app in my phone I open up a web

157
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,340
browser

158
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,260
I go to Leafly calm then either log in

159
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,939
or create an account it's really easy to

160
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,500
create an account it won't take you that

161
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,538
long you have to have an account to

162
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,689
leave a review or to create a new strain

163
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:32,199
so create a new account log in then from

164

171
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,348
page where you can actually add a new

172
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,110
strain so it says create a new review it

173
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:55,629

182
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,430
it is a sativa dominant hybrid but it is

183
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,900
a hybrid now once you've clicked on all

184
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,999
of that it will take you to the next

185
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:23,709
page which is where you can type a

186
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,810
review it will ask you to rate this

stars

189
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:31,180
of course I encourage you to give five

190
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:33,128
stars but be honest if you don't feel

191
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,019
like it was worth five give it what you

192
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,968
feel like it deserves then it says what

193
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,500

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,789
the street

253
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,169

254
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,149
reveal where it came from you can leave

255
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,599
that tap blank and that will be just

256
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,279
fine

257
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,680
then at the end you just click Save my

258
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,689

00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,269

268
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,549

into this show and my throat is starting

275
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,740
to sound like crap my voice is starting

276
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,299
to get funky so I'm gonna press pause

277
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm gonna pound a bunch of water and

278
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:26,939
then when I get back we're gonna talk

279
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:50,859
about watering our cannabis plants

280
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:53,749
[Music]

281
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:55,549

I was gone I took some dad's of some

283
00:09:55,548 --> 00:10:00,528
Doctor Who full-spectrum extract from

284
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:03,470
Green Dot labs this stuff tastes like a

285
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:06,048
strawberry Kiwi Snapple the package says

286
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,209
passionfruit guava and strawberry taffy

287
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:10,850
but I got more of a kiwi strawberry

288
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,438
Snapple sort of a flavor kind of woke me

289
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,659
up snap me out of that little mellow

290
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:16,938
buzz from the other tabs I approve

291
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,399
now before I press pause and took a

292
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:20,889
break and hydrated and medicated I said

293
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,839
I was going to come back and talk about

294
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,339
watering our plants something that we do

295
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,399
every day something that seems so simple

296
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,619
something that we can really do wrong if

297
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,438
we're not paying attention so let's get

298
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:35,298
right into watering our plants I'm gonna

299
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:37,188
talk about something that I call one

300
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,629
through five water tech it's something I

301
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:40,248
use to train new employees it's

302
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,110
something I go over with anybody who

303
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:43,699
waters plants they get trained on one

304
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,528
through five water tech it's something I

305
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:46,969
could recommend to every commercial grow

306
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:49,159
that's something I can recommend to

307
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,629
every home grow if you're watering with

308
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,368
a pitcher if you're watering with a

309
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,528
watering one if you're watering with an

310
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:56,569
automated drip system however you have

311
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,539
chosen to water your plants this will

312
00:10:56,568 --> 00:11:01,428
work for you now keep in mind when

313
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:03,318
you're watering the plants we need to

314
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,938
saturate our medium we don't want to

315
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:06,889
leave dry spots in there we want to wet

316
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:09,110
everything but we don't want to drown

317
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,119
the roots so you need enough water in

318
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,459
there to get everything wet you want a

319
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:14,809
little bit of runoff but then you don't

320
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,188
want it so much water in there that

321
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,899
they're spongy and the plants are

322
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:19,849
drowning and you forced out all of the

323
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,519
oxygen so it's a nice balance that you

324
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,860
need to find it takes time this will be

325
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,720
a way to help you dial it in also think

326
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,369
about this Jorge Cervantes taught us a

327
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,589
very long time ago in one of the very

328
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:33,319
first Grove videos I ever watched Jorge

329
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,569
said water should be abundant but not

330
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:38,448
excessive so keep that in mind you want

331
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:41,058
an abundance of water but not excessive

332
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:43,488
water so the idea behind that is to

333
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:45,409
water them thoroughly give them me a lot

334
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:47,300
of water to where the whole medium all

335
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,559
of the cocoa all the soil is saturated

336
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,838
there's a little water coming out of the

337
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,939
bottom now the water is abundant now

338
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,279
don't water it again until it needs it

339
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,060
and that is not excessive you've got

340
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:01,039
abundance and not excess also focus on

341
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,689
not getting all of the water directly in

342
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,509
the center of the pot the roots are

343
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,700
growing outward your freshest hungriest

344
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,769
most vigorous roots are out there at the

345
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,269
outer edge so water the outer edge of

346
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,399
the plant and let the water work its way

347
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,649
in don't don't go just pour in the water

348
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,990
dead center try to try to get the whole

349
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,000
pot saturated I keep saying you want the

350
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,310
whole pot saturated and that's our goal

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,019
if you're pouring nutrients into your

352
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,879
solution you're pouring that water into

353
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,649
that root zone you want that everywhere

354
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,028
so that every root can eat you don't

355
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,500
want it to have to go digging around to

356
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,179
try to find whatever you just fed it

357
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,190
wears the plus life where is it you

358
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:35,539
wanted to just go uh yeah there's plus

359
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,310
life you just want those roots to be

360
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,139
saturated or you want that dirt to be

361
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,669
saturated so those roots know right

362
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,929
where it is it's right here I'm just

363
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:43,338
touching it already it's been

364
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,049
hand-delivered to me they just brought

365
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:46,670
it right to me on a cafeteria tray I'm

366
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:48,319
gonna eat up this plus life I'm going to

367
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:51,409
eat up this shine I'm gonna eat up this

368
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,550
HD and some fulvic and we're just gonna

369
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,129
take it up is they don't have to go

370
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,750
anywhere for it so saturate your medium

371
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,909
that is my point now let's actually talk

372
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,970
a little bit about 1 through 5 water

373
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:04,219
tech 1 through 5 is a good way to

374
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,399
balance out your wet and dry cycles in

375
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,589
your pots if your plants get too dry or

376
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,230
if they're too wet you will have pH

377
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,630
fluctuations you will have slow root

378
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,459
growth your plants will stop eating you

379
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,110
will have diminished yields if your

380
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,879
plants are too wet or too dry for too

381
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,409
long you will definitely see problems

382
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,659
you've seen what happens if plants get

383
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:25,250
too dry right you know what happens if

384
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:26,689
they get too wet I'm sure some of you

385
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,759
have seen what happens it's the same

386
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,829
thing as if they get too dry so we

387
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,328
always try to keep our plants right at

388
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:34,099
the sweet spot we don't want them dry we

389
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:35,899
don't want them soggy we want them right

390
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,409
where I call number 3 so let's just get

391
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:41,299
right into 1 through 5 now for this to

392
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:43,939
work you're gonna need all of your

393
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,009
plants in the same size and shape pot

394
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,570
with the same amount of medium so that's

395
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,278
really gonna help you out you'll you'll

396
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,660
learn from this you'll learn how to

397
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,338
adjust that but if you want to teach

398
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:55,338
this technique you need everything to be

399
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,690
the same you need it to all match up you

400
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,220
need a uniform that makes it a lot

401
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,260
easier to teach this and to keep this

402
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,759
into production with your crew so

403
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,980
get the pot that you're gonna use get

404
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,629
the medium that you're going to use fill

405
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,399
that pot just like you were gonna fill

406
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,509
it with a plant put your plant in there

407
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,429
just like you're gonna transplant a

408
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:13,559
fresh plant in there pack it down just

409
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,939
like you would do not water it get done

410
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,319
get it all the way done have it just

411
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,610
where you're gonna water it have all the

412
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,140
amount of cocoa or all the amount of

413
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,970
dirt that you're gonna have in there be

414
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,740
done I keep shaking the pot that's in my

415
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,149
hand that is invisible but I'm shaking

416
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,980
it to get all that dirt back down to the

417
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,329
bottom twisted a couple times to get all

418
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,519
that dirt moved into place pack the

419
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,050
plant down in there nice and tight it's

420
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,490
nice and snug it's ready to go all you

421
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,069
need now is water right don't pour the

422
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,560
water set that pot down now get another

423
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,450
pot and do just the same thing put a

424
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,369
plant in there fill it with cocoa or

425
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,509
soil or whatever you're gonna use do it

426
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,129
the same as you did the other one the

427
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:46,470
same exact method the same technique

428
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,700
pack it down make it match if you do

429
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,019
that thing where you pick up the pot and

430
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,640
tap it on the ground a few times to get

431
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,259
the dirt in there I'm sure you just

432
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,429
heard me hit the table just tap that in

433
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,250
there a little bit to get it into place

434
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:58,379
get it to settle shake it into place do

435
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,669
the same thing to all of the pots now

436
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,649
you've got one you did not pour any

437
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:03,419
water through now this other pot that we

438
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,620
just potted for the sake of this

439
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,469
training let's say that we're using

440
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,879
three gallon pots push the one pot aside

441
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,170
it doesn't get any water right now yeah

442
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,399
that plant is gonna start looking angry

443
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,750
in a few minutes but we'll rescue it

444
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,309
don't worry it'll get CPR in a little

445
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,470
while after training classes over but

446
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:18,869
this other plant that we just put in the

447
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,759
pot let's soak the [ __ ] out of it let's

448
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,529
pour like 2 maybe 3 gallons of water

449
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,330
through this pot until water is just

450
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,799
gushing out of the bottom we may kill

451
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,290
this plant but this is the sake of

452
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,629
training so we're gonna just pour water

453
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,309
through it until it's saturated and then

454
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,559
when you think it's saturated with water

455
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,789
pour a little bit more in there just to

456
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,199
where it is just pouring out of the

457
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,549
bottom uncontrollably to where you've

458
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,080
made a mess on the floor and you're like

459
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:41,579
what the hell is happening we kind of

460
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,410
mad at me about it now I don't have all

461
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,570
this water on the floor this is for the

462
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,449
for the sake of training we want to soak

463
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,070
that plant to death now well all that

464
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,660
water is running out of there I want you

465
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,910
to pick that pot up if you're using a

466
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,679
fabric pot it's gonna be heavy you're

467
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:57,480
gonna have to grab it with two hands by

468
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,739
the edges and it's gonna try to stretch

469
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,820
on you it's gonna be real heavy and all

470
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,379
the dirt it's gonna act like a big

471
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,520
grocery bag all the dirts gonna cave to

472
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,590
the bottom it's gonna get real

473
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,029
cumbersome if you're using a plastic pot

474
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,500
you're gonna need two hands you're gonna

475
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,659
have to grab it under the lips on the

476
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,490
edges and try to pick it up it's gonna

477
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,649
be really heavy remember the weight of

478
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,860
that that is a five that's how we're

479
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:16,649
gonna start teaching one through

480
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,300
five water tech that's saturated

481
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,740
overwatered that's a number five that

482
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,779
other pot that we push to the side that

483
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,149
we didn't put any water in that isn't

484
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,649
number one pick that pot up when you go

485
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,299
to pick it up you might accidentally

486
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,129
throw it up into the air after picking

487
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:33,309
up that number five it's gonna be super

488
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:36,220
light that is a number one now let's

489
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:39,099
talk a little bit about the range of one

490
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,710
through five water tech the idea behind

491
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,110
water tech is picking up each and every

492
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,420
single plant and deciding is this a one

493
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,820
is this a - is this a three as this a

494
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:50,409
four is this a five and then

495
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,870
understanding how to water it

496
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,459
appropriately based on your professional

497
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,100
assessment yes you'll be a professional

498
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,810
after this training so number one when

499
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,610
you pick up the plant and you almost

500
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,189
throw it up into the air because it's so

501
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,690
dry that's a number one you should be

502
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,269
able to tell by looking at the plant

503
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,860
that it is at a number one the leaves

504
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:10,389
are drooping they're hanging down the

505
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,429
plant looks sad it's starting to tip

506
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,590
over a little bit the top soil or the

507
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,090
top of your Coco the surface is starting

508
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,279
to look a little crispy and crunchy you

509
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,289
can tell that it is visibly dry that

510
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,629
isn't number one that is a sign that

511
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,359
your plant is slowly dying

512
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,240
it is not eating and it's got the risk

513
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,000
of death and also you were absolutely

514
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,519
going to have diminished yields you were

515
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,680
losing time the whole time that plant is

516
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,389
sitting there looking like death you

517
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,100
were wasting time you were moving

518
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,720
backwards with your girl you're not

519
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,490
making any productivity you were

520
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,269
torturing that plant and pissing it off

521
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,769
and wasting time so number one

522
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:49,839
undesirable also another result of a

523
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,490
number one you're [ __ ] fired if you

524
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,199
work in a commercial grow and I'm the

525
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,789
manager and I walk in and those plants

526
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,860
are number one whoever was in charge

527
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,659
that day is coming to the office we're

528
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,879
gonna talk about it and you may not come

529
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,200
back after that so that's number one

530
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,330
don't be scared I'm not gonna fire you

531
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,940
guys number two number two is when the

532
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:08,500
plants need water you can see it they're

533
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,210
just starting to droop they're like hey

534
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,130
uh can we get a drink now that's number

535
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,660
two right when they start to droop you

536
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,730
can see the difference in the top soil

537
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,950
that top layer is just starting to

538
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,480
change to brownish it's not totally it's

539
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,400
not black anymore like when it was moist

540
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,529
and it's not gray because it's totally

541
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,269
dry or it hasn't turned that cork color

542
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:28,029
because it's cocoa we haven't gotten

543
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,200
that far number two it's like hey we can

544
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,788
do

545
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,399
some water that's pretty much the prime

546
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:34,528
time to give it some water so number two

547
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:35,908
the growth is kind of slowing down the

548
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:37,798
roots are going hey man we could use

549
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,820
some water pretty soon but that's right

550
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,009
when you want to give it some water

551
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:44,220
right when it hits to number two number

552
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,648
three number three is when it is perfect

553
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,509
and thriving

554
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:50,158
number three is where you want to be to

555
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,379
get to number three though you're going

556
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,380
to have to water either a four or a five

557
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,120
and let it dry down to that three and

558
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,760
then maybe just a little bit pass to

559
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,888
that two now it sounds really easy if

560
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,720
you've got a home grow but what if you

561
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,250
work in a large facility and you've got

562
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,110
to leave overnight in a lot of

563
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,388
commercial facilities we clock out at 5

564
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:11,158
or 7 p.m. and we don't come back until

565
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:12,959
7:00 or 9:00 in the morning

566
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,278
the plants are still gonna be the lights

567
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,960
are still gonna be on for a little while

568
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,638
when we leave if we work an eight or a

569
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,019
nine or a ten hour shift the lights are

570
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:21,298
on for twelve hours so we're still gonna

571
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,589
have two hours of lights on they're

572
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,849
still gonna be grower if they're in veg

573
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:25,740
they're still gonna be on for way longer

574
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:27,240
but the plants are still gonna be on so

575
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,620
they're still gonna be active then

576
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,058
they're gonna be drinking and you're

577
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:32,398
gonna have the night cycle to deal with

578
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,259
they're gonna have to last that shift

579
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:36,629
until we come back to work whatever it

580
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,369
is if we leave it will say five then you

581
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,830
have six seven eight nine ten eleven

582
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,599
twelve one two three four five six seven

583
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,278
eight in the morning you got ten solid

584
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,109
hours tell anybody comes back and checks

585
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:48,509
on them they have to stay wet so that's

586
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:50,729
why I say maybe water them at a five and

587
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,259
let them chill out and work their way

588
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,759
through let them cycle through overnight

589
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,349
and then by the time you get there in

590
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,450
the morning hopefully they're right at a

591
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:59,219
three or maybe a tattoo so that you can

592
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,750
water them so that's why it's an

593
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,210
important thing to think about you may

594
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,950
have to overwater at that five just so

595
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,929
that by the time you come back to work

596
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,370
the next morning they're not air21 and

597
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,230
everybody goes home because there are no

598
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,000
plants to take care of so I'm gonna

599
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,220
continue on with the number three is

600
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,690
where I was three is perfect that's

601
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,759
where we would like to stay all the time

602
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,679
there's the right amount of oxygen in

603
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,908
the root zone the pH is correct the

604
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,490
plants are eating the plants are

605
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,139
thriving they're growing everybody is

606
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,240
happy three is where we would like to

607
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:29,278
stay but we've got air flow and

608
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,409
evaporation and science and nature to

609
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:34,319
work with so we can't stay at a constant

610
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:36,840
at a constant three three is kind of if

611
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,778
you poke your finger down into the dirt

612
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,668
just about two inches and you feel some

613
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:42,119
moisture in there that's about a number

614
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:44,640
three

615
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,739
they're not soaked they're not dry the

616
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,990
plants are just going crazy you can tell

617
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,880
that is a number three when those plants

618
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,559
are happy so that's a number three you

619
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,150
guys try to you're gonna have to dial

620
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,440
this in and practice like I said this is

621
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,090
gonna take some practice in your own

622
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,830
garden that's why I gave you a number

623
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,689
one that's why I gave you a number five

624
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:02,159
to see and then you're gonna have to

625
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,750
watch them a little bit and see where

626
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,730
that fine line for number three is watch

627
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,559
your plants see when they're super happy

628
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,630
pick up the pot feel the weight of that

629
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,759
that's probably at number three so let's

630
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,830
move forward to number four number four

631
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,259
is when you're just a little bit too wet

632
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:18,480
but honestly number four is where I

633
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,339
water my plants too right when they're

634
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,289
watered as I'm watering I aim for number

635
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,509
four like that's just a little bit too

636
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,609
much water I've got 10 to 20 percent of

637
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,140
my water that goes in is dripping out of

638
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:30,419
the bottom of my pots but I'm making

639
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,950
sure to water in a circle I don't just

640
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,690
pour the water right into the center I

641
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,130
go around the edge of the pots and watch

642
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,529
the water fill into the middle as it

643
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,450
goes it really works very well so I

644
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,369
water until about ten or twenty percent

645
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,860
is coming out of the bottom that's in

646
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:46,829
number four the pot is heavy but they're

647
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:49,199
not goopy and muddy there's not mud in

648
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,699
your pot it is just really wet and I

649
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,019
know you're gonna have to play with this

650
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,910
to figure it out it depends on how much

651
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,769
perlite you've got in there it depends

652
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,330
on how much cocoa you're using it's

653
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,490
gonna depend on a few things but you'll

654
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:01,230
be able to dial this in and customize

655
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,599
this to your grow you'll be able if

656
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,490
you're a if you're the manager this is a

657
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,719
good way to teach your staff on one

658
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,789
through five if you're the manager

659
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,019
you're touching on does that make sense

660
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:11,220
if you're the manager you're bright

661
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,420
enough they trusted you and you're

662
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,400
bright enough to be able to catch on to

663
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,200
what I'm saying by now if you're a home

664
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,670
grower this is a good way to teach your

665
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,500
back up maybe you've got somebody that's

666
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,820
gonna come help you grow when you go on

667
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,349
vacation maybe you want to get your

668
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,480
girlfriend into there and you're kind of

669
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:26,879
leery on teaching her how to water this

670
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,289
is a way to involve your other half into

671
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,850
the garden maybe you want to get the

672
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:31,379
kids in there maybe you got a new grower

673
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,240
whoever it is this is a good way to

674
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,460
teach people one through five technique

675
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,680
so number four is where I water my

676
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,390
plants to right in the morning when I'm

677
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,980
giving them that fresh first feed I aim

678
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,170
for number four they're a little bit too

679
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,759
wet but if you watch them an hour or two

680
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,680
later they've hit number three they're

681
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,869
just fine by the time the lights go off

682
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,100
they're just about to hit number two but

683
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,049
they don't cycle through much through

684
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,609
the night so the plants are gonna be

685
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,869
just fine overnight when the lights come

686
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,829
on in the morning they're either gonna

687
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,719
be red

688
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:59,428
low into number three just getting a

689
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,750
little bit dry or right at the top end

690
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,298
of number two just like hey you should

691
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,069
water us you guys I'm not sure why but

692
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:08,490
at this point in the recording for about

693
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:10,349
thirty seconds the file just started

694
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,028
making a hissing noise and it sounded

695
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,949
terrible so you only missed about thirty

696
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:15,538
seconds of this episode I'm going to

697
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,370
figure out why this keeps happening and

698
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:18,990
I'm going to correct the issue but it

699
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:20,819
was only about thirty seconds I cut out

700
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,120
the annoying hiss so let's get back to

701
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,889
the show and also if you've got more

702
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,148
than like ten or twenty percent of what

703
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,528
you're putting in coming out of the

704
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:30,000
bottom then you're starting to overwater

705
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:32,398
we only want about ten or twenty percent

706
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,500
coming out of the bottom now let's talk

707
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:37,199
about the dreaded number five if you

708
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,788
were at number five your medium is soggy

709
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,470
there's just water gushing out of the

710
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:43,079
bottom of your pot it may be sitting in

711
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,639
stagnant water we never want that that

712
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,500
isn't number five those plants are

713
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:48,599
drowning they're not getting any oxygen

714
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,240
they're struggling the leaves are

715
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,949
drooping they're probably starting to

716
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,359
get kind of soft at the base where the

717
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,679
stick meets the soil you're gonna get

718
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,589
mushy there because they're starting to

719
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,649
rot we're risking root rot we're risking

720
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:04,558
stem rot we are risking death when the

721
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:06,329
plants are that moist also you were

722
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,158
certainly slowing down your growth and

723
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:10,558
diminishing your yields when you get

724
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,990
your plants to a number-5 level of

725
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,730
moisture so try to avoid that you guys

726
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,460
pay attention to our number four is and

727
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,538
stop there water the plants wait for

728
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,340
something to come out of the bottom if

729
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:22,200
nothing comes out porn a little bit more

730
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,408
if nothing comes out porn a little bit

731
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,759
more if you're using a three gallon pot

732
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:28,200
maybe just pour in a half a gallon of

733
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,388
water and see what happens that's a good

734
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,069
start then if you need more you can

735
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:34,229
always add more remember you can't reach

736
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:37,138
in there and take water out of that pot

737
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,240
now that's one through five one will

738
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:40,888
kill the plants five you run the risk of

739
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,599
killing the plants three is right where

740
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:44,699
you want to be you've got to figure out

741
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,949
how to keep those plants right around

742
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,330
two three four as long as possible and

743
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,370
when they get too dry you gotta water

744
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:52,379
them again without over watering them

745
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,819
now this is gonna be challenging based

746
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,710
on the size of your plants if your

747
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,119
plants are smaller they're much more

748
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,308
critical through that one through five

749
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,989
phase it means a lot more to them when

750
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:02,700
they get bigger they can handle a lot

751
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,710
more stress they can handle a lot more

752
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,509
abuse once that root ball gets developed

753
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:09,750
in that pot they can definitely take

754
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:11,670
more excessive water so if you've got

755
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,009
big plants and you do need to go away

756
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,620
for a long time you can soak those up to

757
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:18,029
a number five just be careful just make

758
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,339
sure that you're not keeping them too

759
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,410
soggy for too long like in a large grow

760
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,970
I'm running three gallon pots we've got

761
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,009
plants that weigh two thousand grams

762
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,350
when we harvest them those plants right

763
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:30,359
before we leave I soak the [ __ ] out of

764
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,369
them I soak them to a five but I'm

765
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,169
confident that by the time I get back to

766
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:36,269
work the next day they're only gonna be

767
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,890
a tattoo so you've got to learn how to

768
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,259
dial in those cycles with your pant

769
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,390
plants the bigger plants will be more

770
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,369
forgiving the smaller plants are always

771
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,750
going to be less forgiving they will let

772
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:48,419
you know when you make mistakes right

773
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,799
away and their cycles will not be as

774
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,230
long so if you've got to be away from

775
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,759
the grow for several hours make sure you

776
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,289
water those little plants right before

777
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,940
you go because they could dry up

778
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,339
overnight if you're not paying attention

779
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,259
you guys that is one through five

780
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,639
watering tech I tried to keep it as

781
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,890
simple as I could

782
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,630
you're gonna have to get a pot and fill

783
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,220
it and make that at number one you're

784
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,290
gonna have to get another pot and soak

785
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,420
the [ __ ] out of it and make that number

786
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,279
five maybe get another one and get water

787
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,990
running out ten or twenty percent that's

788
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,250
your number four then you'll be able to

789
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,170
figure out where the three and the two

790
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,000
live from there then you'll be able to

791
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,830
dial it in then if you're setting up an

792
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,869
auto water system that will help you

793
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:27,029
dial in how much water to give it and

794
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:29,129
how often it'll also help you to teach

795
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:31,609
the new people how to dial in that

796
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,780
garden perfectly and keep in mind

797
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,799
cannabis is very picky and

798
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:37,049
strain-specific

799
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,569
so some plants may want a lot of water

800
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:42,720
and some plants may not want any water

801
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:45,149
so pay attention to each cultivar not

802
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,339
just each table you may have to think

803
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,630
about which plants go on which table if

804
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,139
you're gonna set up an auto system

805
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,780
because durbin poison wants barely any

806
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,250
water where a golden goat will drink all

807
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,779
of the water so you're gonna have to

808
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,960
plan on that and pay attention and

809
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:02,278
adjust and adapt

tech I hope you guys learned something I

hope you're able to teach somebody else

814
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,950
something about one through five water

815
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,808
tech I know it sounds simple but it's

816
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,528
probably something a lot of people are

817
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:18,720
making mistakes on and overlooking it's

818
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:20,759
also something that managers will be

819
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,259
able to train grow Tech's on which will

820
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,220
be very helpful for the cannabis

821
