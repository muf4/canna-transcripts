right i feel like i'm rambling there's

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,159
one more thing i should talk about

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,799
before we get to the main topic of

68
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,959
today's podcast i am recording during a

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,719
crazy thunder and lightning storm it

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
started right as i decided to record it

71
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,318
was raining a little bit i hit record

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,759
and then we got some major thunder and

73
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,159
lightning so if here's some chaos in the

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,318
background it is not world war three to

75
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,680
the best of my knowledge out there uh we

76
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,679
did take a couple of dabs it's been a

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,439
minute since i looked outside but if you

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
hear some noise it is just a major

79
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,680
thunderstorm i enjoy that thunderous

80
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,359
sound it is powerful shook the whole

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
house scared the [ __ ] out of me maybe

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
i'll clip that part out where i almost

83
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
[ __ ] my pants during the thunder anyway

84
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,958
if you hear some noise that's what's

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,639
happening

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,759
i did mention i took some dabs that's

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,679
right i smoked some live batter of the

88
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,878
machine that's right a grower in denver

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
who does not want to be mentioned

90
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,399
because you guys will bother him and

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
harass him for too much product a grower

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
in denver grew the machine he was one of

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
the test growers he got to grow the

94
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
machine before a lot of people he found

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,080
a great phenotype that smells like skunk

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
ass covered in gasoline sounds

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,840
disgusting i love it he makes amazing

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,439
bho rosin a bho batter out of it

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
when i smoke that stuff i get a little

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,079
silly i feel like i get these blinders

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
on

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
i feel like there's like tunnel vision

103
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,318
or the things they put on the horses so

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
the horse can't look to the side it just

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,318
stays focused on the journey i feel like

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
that happens to me when i smoke that so

107

reversed the golden goat using a

166
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,879
solution it was a female plant but i

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
used it as a pollen donor which is

168
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,240
technically the same thing i'm doing

169
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,478
with the male plant everything i did

170
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
with that reversed golden goat was magic

171
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,800
everything it pollinated was gold

172
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,639
then i took the gold took the i said

173
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,079
took then i took the golden goat and i

174
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,720
pollinated that with the daybreaker i

175
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,599
made my own cross called arise i made my

176
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,160
own arize s1 out of that batch of arise

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
s1 seeds i found a male in there that

178
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,319
was stellar he's everything i could ask

179
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,839
for in a male plant that i was looking

180
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
for at that time and we're going to talk

181
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,719
about that a lot but that arise male

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
plant got he's got his own name he is an

183
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
arise f1 plant but he's got his own name

184
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
he is known as king solomon so king

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,439
solomon has pollinated hundreds of other

186
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,799
female plants if you understand culture

187
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,839
you'll understand why i chose the name

188
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,680
solomon for him uh but king solomon is a

189
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,599
lot of what makes my company successful

190
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,319
people know me for my know my company

191
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,160
for my arise mail people look for things

192
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,000
if i say i pollinated this plant with

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
solomon like i want that i need those

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
seeds so solomon is a very sought after

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,079
male a very reliable male plant um

196
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,160
now let's talk about what makes a

197
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,918
reliable sought after male plant since

198
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,439
i'm a breeder i do a lot of breeding i'm

199
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,758
talking about my success with king

200
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,079
solomon my successful male let's talk

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
about selecting a male plant for your

202
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,159
breeding and traits that we would be uh

203
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
looking for and tracy would be desirable

204
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
and how i do a male let's just jump

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
right into it so first of all it's all

206
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,719
about your goal and your desire what are

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,680
you trying to do as a breeder as a seed

208
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
maker are you working with female plants

209
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
that you want to improve do you have an

210
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,598
aroma a flavor an effect that you were

211
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,079
specifically looking for some people

212
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,519
have uh physical or mental or other

213
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,038
types of ailments which they are trying

214
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,279
to cure or mitigate or uh re find relief

215
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,959
from with cannabis and sometimes we

216
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,399
found that this plant does a lot of good

217
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,598
things and this plant does a lot of good

218
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,719
things but this plant's missing

219
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,000
something and this one's missing

220
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,880
something maybe if we breed them

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,319
together we can put the aroma and flavor

222
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,918
from this one and the potency in this

223
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,280
one we'll get the headache relief from

224
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,879
this one and the body relief from this

225
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,359
one it may work perfect for some

226
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,839
patients for a specific person so maybe

227
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
you're breeding for a specific

228
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,198
person's medicine to treat them maybe

229
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
you're breeding for your grow maybe

230
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
you're breeding just because you got

231
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,800
this cool idea that if you cross uh

232
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
plant a with crop plant b plant c is

233
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
going to be [ __ ] stellar it is all

234
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,038
about your goal what are you breeding

235
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,000
for also are you breeding for your

236
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,598
personal selection for your personal uh

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
is it a hobby is it something a passion

238
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,038
that you're trying to do or do you plan

239
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
on doing this on a commercial level

240
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,399
putting seeds out for retail it's all

241
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,560
about your goal

242
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,000
most of most of anything in life if you

243
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,839
want to be successful here i go getting

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,759
all philosophical it's all about your

245
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,519
goal set yourself up for success from

246
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
the very beginning that way when you get

247
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,240
to the end you're happy with the outcome

248
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,918
you got there you didn't have to make

249
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
all kinds of side paths and do all kinds

250
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,598
of weird work set yourself up for

251
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,918
success from the beginning so it's all

252
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,199
about a good goal with a male plant why

253
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,560
are you breeding it what are you trying

254
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,478
to do what are you what are you

255
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,958
intending to achieve with the cross or

256
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
crosses that you make from this male uh

257
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,799
it's like if you're trying to make um

258
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,879
i'm gonna pick random foods here if

259
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,718
we're trying to make lasagna and cake we

260
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,240
need completely different ingredients if

261
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
i'm making lasagna and i show up with

262
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,159
ingredients for cake we can't make a

263
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,278
successful cake uh or the opposite i'm

264
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,399
not even sure how i went with that but

265
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,399
you get what i'm saying if i don't have

266
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,399
the right [ __ ] the goal will never be

267
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
the same the goal will never be reached

268
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,159
so set yourself up for success if you're

269
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
trying to make a short squatty plant

270
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,159
that flowers early a tall skinny male

271
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,079
plant will not be the way to go you need

272
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,838
the male plant that is short and squatty

273
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,800
and flowers early so it's all about that

274
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,720
goal

275
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,359
then it's all about what am i trying to

276
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
do what am i trying to fix or create or

277
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
what's my final destination that's what

278
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,799
it's all about in breeding so if you've

279
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
got to pick a male plant that will get

280
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,039
you to your final destination what is

281
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,559
the desired shape

282
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,519
one of the first things we can see in

283
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,359
plants is leaf shape and plant structure

284
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
by looking at leaf shape we can kind of

285
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,039
get an idea of a lot more of the plant

286
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,639
how it's going to grow if the leaves are

287
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,159
long and skinny that plant's probably

288
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,439
going to get tall it's going to get kind

289
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,439
of lanky it's going to take a little bit

290
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
of time to flower if the leaves are real

291
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
wide and you can camp out under them and

292
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,719
make shade with them that plant most

293
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,639
likely will stay short and stocky and it

294
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,639
will finish a little more quickly of

295
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,080
course there are anomalies the og cushes

296
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,439
make those big leaves and then they take

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,879
a little while to flower and they get

298
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,320
stretchy there's going to be things in

299
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,759
between there but the leaf shape will

300
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
give you a hint of what you're looking

301
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,958
for

302
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,639
what type of leaf shape are you looking

303
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,919
for you know if you've grown if you're

304
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,399
breeding i hope you've grown a lot of

305
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,159
plants uh if you're breeding you know

306
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,679
what kind of plants you like you know

307
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,519
what leaf shape you're interested in

308
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,599
what the goal is so what kind of leaf

309
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
shape are you looking for then what kind

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,240
of plant structure are you looking for

311
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,560
i tend to breed i'm super tall and

312
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,720
skinny and lanky the plants i breed

313
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,879
seem to kind of fall that direction i

314
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
make tall skinny lanky plants some of

315
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,838
the stuff i breed will be shorter and

316
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,079
squattier but it just depends on what

317
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
i'm working with i like plants that can

318
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,799
get kind of bigger because a lot of my

319
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
stuff ends up in a commercial

320
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,639
environment i like plants that grow

321
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,399
really tall and make big giant top colas

322
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,480
that's just something i really enjoy

323
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,000
some breeders want stuff that stays

324
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,440
shorter and squattier because their

325
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,039
environment or their customers are

326
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,560
growing in shorter squattier

327
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,240
environments so it's all about the

328
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,159
desired goal what is the shape and

329
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,919
structure what is the height if your

330
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,199
plants are going to get too tall many

331
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,599
people can't grow them if they're going

332
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,519
to get too wide many people can't grow

333
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
them so find a male plant that offers

334
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,159
the structure which you desire

335
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,720
the width the height all of that stuff

336
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,120
matters but also veg time do they veg

337
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,879
quickly are they real slow to veg when

338
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,759
you cut clones do the clones root well

339
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,360
because you're going to want to keep

340
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,360
this male plant around if you make

341
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
crosses with it and it's successful the

342
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
next thing you want to do is make more

343
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,399
crosses so you've got to be able to

344
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,879
clone this male plant that trait will

345
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
also pass to the offspring that clone

346
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,799
ability so how do they veg do they grow

347
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
well do they handle stress do they

348
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
handle

349
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,559
problems how long is the flower time a

350
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,639
lot of people don't get the opportunity

351
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,919
to flower out a male plant we only get

352
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,439
to let it go long enough to see that

353
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,838
it's a male and then we cut it down i've

354
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,240
got a space dedicated to male plants

355
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,000
i'll put multiple multiple male plants

356
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
in a room and flower them all out at one

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,078
time and see who does the best just like

358
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
we do a pheno hunt for female plants

359
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,719
that's what i would recommend grow your

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
plants isolate the males take notes

361
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
number them plant one plant two and then

362
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
take notes plant number one is doing

363
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
this plant number two is doing this you

364
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
can visually see most of the things you

365
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
wanna see as a breeder once you've

366
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
gotten the eye you can see like oh

367
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,720
that's the one you'll start noticing so

368
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
start paying attention to flower time

369
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
when you put the plant into flower how

370
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
does it react does it go into flower

371
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
quickly does it take a while to go into

372
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,759
flower does it skyrocket and stretch the

373
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,199
minute you put it into flower how long

374
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,519
is that stretch phase some plants

375
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,519
stretch for 14 days some plants stretch

376
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
for four weeks it just depends on what

377
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
kind of genetics you've got there find a

378
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,959
male plant that has the acceptable

379
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,159
amount and time frame of stretch which

380
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,799
you were looking for because that's

381
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,360
going to translate heavily into your

382
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,838
offspring now let's talk about pollen

383
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,839
time and pollen production if you're

384
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,360
making seeds we obviously need pollen

385
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,680
how long does it take for that male

386
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
plant to start producing viable pollen

387
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,278
and enough of it to make it worth

388
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,039
pollinating your garden some are really

389
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,879
stingy some they'll start putting out

390
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,719
pollen really soon you've got to find

391
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,639
the one that produces at the time you

392
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
want and the amount of pollen which you

393
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,519
desire something i like in a male plant

394
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,439
is a big fat top cola that just tells me

395
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,278
that it's going to send fat tops to its

396
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279
offspring if you can get a male plant

397
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,200
that produces a lot of fat tops that's

398
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,679
always a good thing i like those big fat

399
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,759
tops those male plants give me a lot of

400
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,439
pollen so what does the top cola look

401
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,838
like how is it shaped how many colas

402
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,000
does it have how does it branch up is it

403
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,360
all one big top cola or a bunch of coals

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,958
that reach up to the top what are you

405
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
looking for the offspring to do because

406
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,159
that is going to translate heavily into

407
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,399
the progeny of this plant now how does

408
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,639
the male plant handle drought stress

409
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720
flood stress nutrient stress i want to

410
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,039
plan i want to stress these plants out

411
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,040
and see what they do under pressure how

412
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,719
do they handle problems do they take

413
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,799
problems and stress well because that is

414
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,200
going to translate heavily into the

415
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,879
offspring if you've got the opportunity

416
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
to put these male plants in an

417
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,838
environment in which you know is

418
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
prone to get powdery mildew throw those

419
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,600
plants in there see if they get pm see

420
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,439
how they react to it if they don't

421
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
definitely breed with those male plants

422
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
you want those males to give you

423
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,519
resistance a lot of that resistance and

424
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,679
health and vigor will come from your

425
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,440
male plant so stress them out give them

426
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,958
cold stress give them heat stress give

427
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
them drought stress

428
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
give them over watering stress over feed

429
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,039
them under feed them

430
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,479
see what they do see how they react if

431
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,919
they peter out and just fall apart and

432
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,199
die on you don't [ __ ] with that male

433
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,759
plant that's weak we don't need that

434
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,240
dude in the garden our whole entire goal

435
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,159
well one of our goals a very important

436
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
goal should be to

437
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,000
improve upon the cannabis plant when

438
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,159
we're taking plant a and plant b and

439
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,759
breeding them we need it to come out i

440
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,319
would expect and hope it to come out

441
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,319
better than plants a and b we need plant

442
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
c to be better if not then we're just

443
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
going back in the line of cannabis if

444
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
you're not improving on it some way

445
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,958
you're not doing the plant any service

446
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
you're not doing yourself justice as a

447
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,399
breeder one of the hardest things is to

448
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
admit and realize that you just made a

449
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
bunch of seeds that are mediocre i'm

450
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,159
getting off track but um think about

451
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,159
plant stress think about stressing these

452
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,000
plants out and see how they react before

453
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,319
we breed with them like i said if you

454
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
put that male plant in an area that gets

455
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
powdery mildew all the time and this

456
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,919
male plant doesn't get it that is a

457
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
great candidate for pollen chucking use

458
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,240
that male where do we go from their

459
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,000
color does your male plant put out color

460
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
a lot of people will find male plants

461
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
that as they start to fade here's why we

462
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,519
got to grow them out like eight nine

463
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,519
maybe even ten weeks of flower on a male

464
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,278
plant see if it starts changing colors

465
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
does it get yellows does it get purples

466
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,879
does it get oranges sometimes they'll

467
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,479
put out those real pretty red colors

468
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,000
those plants that put out those colors

469
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
will pass that trade along to the

470
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,039
progeny so pay attention to that trait

471
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,278
what about trichomes is your male plant

472
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,799
putting out trichomes if that bad dog is

473
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,759
putting out trichomes then it will

474
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,879
definitely pass on potency as a trait in

475
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,639
the future so check that out um

476
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,360
then does that male plant have any

477
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,198
special traits positive or negative

478
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
because those things will appear in the

479
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,359
offspring if that plant has a problem if

480
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,359
it's pissing you off because of this one

481
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,680
reason don't breed with it because that

482
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,079
one reason will be what's it called

483
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,239
exacerbated it will be exponentially

484
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,399
displayed in the progeny so don't use

485
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
that one if it's already pissing you off

486
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,559
if it's doing something that you go oh

487
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,759
that's rad i like this plant that's what

488
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,039
you're supposed to do that's what

489
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,879
breeding is about you're supposed to be

490
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,719
drawn to it attracted to it and want to

491
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,000
reproduce with it it's weird that we're

492
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
looking at a plant and getting that

493
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,198
feeling but it is the right idea oh that

494
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,639
plant right there bro i want to

495
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,000
pollinate that one with king solomon

496
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,839
that's going to be awesome that's the

497
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,440
excitement that i feel when i see the

498
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
right male plant or the right female

499
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
plant for a breeding project so pay

500
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,919
attention to that you'll get that

501
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
feeling inside don't breed with the

502
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,679
plant just because you you can it's not

503
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,278
best practices to breed with the male

504
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,719
plant just because you've got it just

505
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,838
because somebody gave me a male plant

506
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,519
just because i have some pollen that

507
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,320
doesn't mean you have to breed with it

508
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,000
breeding should be about selection

509
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
selection should be a very important

510
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,039
part of your breeding

511
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,240
i consider it like

512
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,919
you sure you could let somebody else

513
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,198
pick out the pollen but that's just like

514
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,278
somebody sending you sperm and you're

515
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,879
making babies with it like how the [ __ ]

516
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,639
do i know what's gonna come out like who

517
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,320
knows i'd like to do a little bit of

518
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,600
selection in that process it means a lot

519
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,680
to me i'm gonna have to deal with the

520
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
progeny forever so why don't i do a

521
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,679
little bit of selection so color

522
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,919
trichome special traits another thing i

523
00:16:53,679 --> 00:17:00,479
want to touch on is i usually do not use

524
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,879
the first male plants to show me that

525
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,038
they are male and to go into flower and

526
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,480
start producing pollen let me explain

527
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
that a little bit

528
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
let's hypothetically say i run a batch

529
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,918
of seeds we don't need a number we're

530
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,679
going to say a batch i've got plenty of

531
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,880
seeds right half of those are going to

532
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
be females they're going to go to

533
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,360
another room half of them are going to

534
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
be males we're putting them in our

535
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,958
project right here some of those plants

536
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,519
are going to start showing that they're

537
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
male even before we put them into flower

538
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,599
those are getting cold i don't want

539
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,520
those then when they go into flower it's

540
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,119
going to take about 14 days for most of

541
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,400
them to show me that they're dudes but

542
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,119
some of them are going to start popping

543
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,120
balls early i don't want to use the male

544
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,759
plants that start popping balls and

545
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,879
showing sex too early because in my

546
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,960
opinion

547
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,520
those plants are going to contribute too

548
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
much of themselves to my breeding

549
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,319
project what i mean is when i breed that

550
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,240
male plant to a female plant i'm not

551
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,079
going to see enough of the female plant

552
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,519
in the progeny to make it worth a

553
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,480
breeding project it's going to be just

554
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,798
reproducing that male plant more often

555
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
than not out of that uh the progeny the

556
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,798
offspring of that breeding project so i

557
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
like to find a male plant kind of my

558
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,480
theory my opinion is that that plant has

559
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,000
just got too much uh too much

560
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
testosterone he's just too much of a

561
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,679
beefcake he's a gym rat anything he

562
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
breeds to all the kids are going to look

563
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
just like him we all know this guy he's

564
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,759
got [ __ ] six kids they all look just

565
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,599
like him we want to do it to where uh

566
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,679
the the breeding looks a little bit like

567
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,918
mommy and a little bit like daddy i hope

568
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,519
for 50 50 in the mix when i do breeding

569
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,840
because if not then i'm just recreating

570
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,519
the female or recreating the male so

571
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,439
what i'm saying is i don't like to use

572
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,960
the male plants that express flower and

573
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,519
start showing their flower and showing

574
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
their sex right away if i've got i said

575
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,240
i wasn't going to pick a number now i'm

576
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,319
going to pick a number if i've got 10 of

577
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
them i probably get rid of the first

578
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,759
three right away the first three to show

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,519
me flower not going to use them then

580
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,359
we're going to work with that thir four

581
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,119
five and six those guys are probably

582
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,639
going to be the ones i use the later

583
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,639
plants to show me flower i don't want

584
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
those for the exact opposite reason

585
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
they're going to make my offspring take

586
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,319
way too long to flower so i want those

587
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
plants right in the middle

588
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,480
that show me good traits that show me

589
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,879
good potential now something else people

590
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,038
are doing we are using sex testing

591
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,640
through labs through the lab you can

592
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,720
actually take a clipping of your leaf

593
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
there's just a little tiny like a hole

594
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,679
punch of a leaf and you can send that to

595
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,919
a lab and they can test that sample for

596
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,360
the presence of cannabinoid precursors

597
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,120
if you're able to send your male plants

598
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,038
to a lab and they can tell you that that

599
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,359
male plant has a high opportunity a high

600
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,279
potential for cannabinoids use that bad

601
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,119
dog that is a great way to do some

602
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,798
breeding selection i always like i said

603
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,719
before like to see the plants touch the

604
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,720
plants rub them feel them smell them

605
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
abuse them that's the way i like to do

606
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,038
breeding selection so don't use those

607
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,719
earlier flowering males because that's

608
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,640
going to transfer into the offspring

609
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,558
they're going to flower too quickly and

610
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,400
they're also going to be too beefcakey

611
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,519
too much of that male i wouldn't want to

612
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
do that

613
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,798
now at least half of your offspring is

614
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,320
going to show uh the male traits so keep

615
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,839
that in mind when you are selecting

616
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,399
whatever you're going to add that mail

617
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,798
to at least 50 will be if we do this

618
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,240
correctly hopefully at least 50 of that

619
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,759
is going to be displayed in the

620
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,319
offspring so whatever you're adding to

621
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,158
that mix is going to show so make it a

622
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,079
good male plant make it something

623
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,679
worthwhile something you'd be proud of

624
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,199
like i said a moment ago don't just take

625
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
a male plant because

626
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,759
one of your friends has a male

627
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,678
that may work maybe it could be cool you

628
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,279
may make some gems but you may make some

629
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,440
complete garbage it's all about

630
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,200
selecting that male if that male gets

631
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,798
your attention if it's what you want do

632
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,880
it but if it's growing weird if it's

633
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,279
wonky if it's got problems get rid of it

634
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,200
because that is going to cause you more

635
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,678
problems down the line now let's get

636
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,360
into the fun part the only way to really

637
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,759
tell what we have created with these

638
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,759
male plants is by growing out the seeds

639
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,599
that they were used to make so the only

640
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,400
way to find out if your male plant was

641
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,639
really a good selection is to pollinate

642
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
multiple females with that plant in my

643
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
opinion you need to pollinate multiple

644
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,960
females because if you just pollinate

645
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
one plant and it works that could be an

646
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,400
anomaly that could be that could be a

647
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,558
hit that could be a fluke if you

648
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
pollinate multiple plants and they are

649
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,480
all great all of the offspring come out

650
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
amazing you did a really good selection

651
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,798
job if 50 of them are great you did a

652
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
pretty good selection job but the first

653
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,759
time you do this you just want to see

654
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,158
what you created and see how your

655
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,599
selection process worked it took a long

656
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,679
time you got male plants you got

657
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,519
multiple female plants you took your

658
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,440
favorite male plant out of the group you

659
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,200
pollinated those girls now it's going to

660
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,120
take you about eight maybe nine weeks to

661
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,558
get those seeds got to get the seeds out

662
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,719
get everything cleaned up now we've got

663
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,558
to germinate and grow a bunch of seeds

664
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
keep them separated keep them numbered

665
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,480
and labeled document the growth and see

666
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,558
what you've created that is the fun part

667
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,480
that is where we see did we choose the

668
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,639
correct mail what does that male give to

669
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
the mix look at the traits of that male

670
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
plant look at the traits of your female

671
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,880
plants which you have pollinated now

672
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,120
grow out those seeds and try to identify

673
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,720
this plant is doing this this trait is

674
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,558
from the mom this trait is from the male

675
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,079
now grow out the other one this trait is

676
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,839
from the mom this trait is from the male

677
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,000
try to see what that male is delivering

678
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,839
across the board to multiple crosses

679
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,919
then you've got good feedback good data

680
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,639
good input on what that dude is actually

681
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,400
delivering in the mix what he's adding

682
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
to the progeny what he's doing to the

683
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
breeding what you're contributing to

684
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,079
your breeding project that is the only

685
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,120
way to do it but that is the funnest

686
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,359
part so breed make a bunch of seeds then

687
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,038
grow them out if you hopefully you kept

688
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,639
a clone of that male because if you like

689
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,480
what you did now you know you've got a

690
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
solid male you can make a bunch more

691
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,839
seeds when you make more of your

692
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,280
favorites out of that first batch

693
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,959
replace the plants you didn't like the

694
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,119
outcome of and put new bad [ __ ] in

695
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,558
there pollinate those test those that is

696
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,959
kind of the way that i got my start with

697
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,279
king solomon pollinated some things grew

698
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,960
them i thought this is [ __ ] amazing

699
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,000
sent those out let friends grow them

700
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
while they were growing them i

701
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
pollinated more [ __ ] to find out if i

702
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,678
had a real stud on my hands or if i just

703
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
hit one out of the park accidentally it

704
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
turns out king solomon is a [ __ ] stud

705
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,400
everything he pollinates uh grows with

706
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,559
more vigor it creates more resin

707
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,880
more potency it just solves all of the

708
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,200
problems i call king solomon the problem

709
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
solver the improver and the fixer of

710
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600
most things uh where are we now if you

711
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,200
grow out those plants and you find out

712
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,439
that that male didn't do what you wanted

713
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,120
it to do guess what start over it's not

714
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,200
that big a deal if you're not relying on

715
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,719
it if this is not your business and it

716
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,159
should not be your business yet that's

717
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,839
something we should touch on if you

718
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
haven't been making seeds and testing

719
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,639
seeds and doing this don't jump in this

720
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
as a business

721
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
your first run of seeds is a hobby this

722
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,240
is an experiment how do you know that

723
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,000
you've even made anything good don't put

724
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
your name on this yet until you grow it

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,079
so if the first round isn't good [ __ ]

726
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
give those seeds away give them to the

727
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,759
birds flush them or let your friends

728
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,599
grow them for free but don't charge them

729
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,200
for them and let them know hey these are

730
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,359
kind of some b grade seeds but they're

731
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,360
free people don't mind free [ __ ] if it's

732
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,119
kind of b grade all right where are we

733
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,439
don't be stubborn have some goals and

734
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,359
some standards only you know if you have

735
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
met your goals and if you are accepting

736
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,798
your standards write down some goals

737
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,639
write down some plans write down some

738
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,918
predictions see if you're meeting your

739
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
goal see if you are correct with your

740
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,559
hypothesis when it comes to growing out

741
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,679
your progeny where are we there's more

742
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,119
to go

743
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,720
a lot of people are intimidated by

744
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,038
breeding a lot of people think that

745
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
they've got to have some gigantic space

746
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,839
for breeding you can do a lot of work in

747
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,519
a very small space you can grow plants

748
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,359
out and find a male

749
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,440
in one gallon pot you could do it in a

750
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,278
cup if you really wanted sprout your

751
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
seed grow it till it's uh what's that

752
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,278
four or five maybe six inches tall put

753
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,880
it into flour they'll go into flour in

754
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,038
like 14 days you can find out if you've

755
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
got boys or girls at that point at that

756
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,158
point you can choose if you want to put

757
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,918
them back into veg or you can keep

758
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,120
flouring them you can re-veg them when

759
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,600
you're done we've talked about this

760
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,038
before you do not need a lot of space to

761
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,678
make seeds once you've got a male

762
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,679
selected you can put a couple of females

763
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,519
or one female in a one gallon pot you

764
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,759
can put that male plant in a one gallon

765
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,679
pot put them in a very small two by two

766
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,278
room with the very small light put them

767
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,798
into flour they'll make seeds very

768
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,640
easily very naturally you don't need a

769
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,240
lot of space it doesn't take a lot of

770
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,240
setup as long as you don't get the

771
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,720
pollen to the plants you don't want

772
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,640
seeded that is the main concern i would

773
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,120
i stagger my crops if i'm breeding in a

774
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,038
small space uh the pollen crop is

775
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,519
happening the next crop is in veg that

776
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,679
way i don't pollinate my seedless my

777
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,200
scentsy crop my smoke crop doesn't get

778
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,440
seeded because i just simply stagger

779
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
them so you can make a little two by two

780
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,360
space put two plants in there put them

781
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,879
on a date bro let them do their thing

782
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,278
make some seeds you don't need all of

783
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,278
the space that people assume they need i

784
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,200
think that wraps up oh i was going to

785
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,440
say father plants male plants kind of

786
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,038
make the breeder we all know that i'm

787
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,038
known for maybe we don't all know we do

788
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,278
by now i am known for the king solomon

789
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,038
male uh subcool was known for his jack

790
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,839
the ripper male a lot of people are just

791
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,038
known for their very popular male plants

792
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,319
that's kind of what sets the breeders

793
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,119
apart that's kind of what makes their

794
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,879
standards i know that seeds here now.com

795
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,639
will not sell your seeds if you just

796
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,360
took like so if you were to buy a pack

797
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,440
of a rise and just use my arise mail and

798
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,038
pollinate a bunch of [ __ ] james bean

799
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,278
won't accept you as a vendor you

800
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,960
actually have to take my arise and breed

801
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,640
it to something and then pull your own

802
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
mail out of there you've got to do a

803
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,480
little bit of work is what we call it so

804
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,480
make your own mail find your own mail

805
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,079
plant don't just you can but don't just

806
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
accept pollen or male plants as gifts

807
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,240
from people i think it's very important

808
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,440
to do a thorough selection process for a

809
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,440
male plant

810
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,038
all right i think that is my lesson on

811
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,798
male plants i wanted to do that because

812
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,599
