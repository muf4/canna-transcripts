00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,158

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,950
society I want people to grow better

63
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,330
cannabis and I want people to have a

64
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,848
better understanding and a better

65
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,780
attitude toward cannabis in general so

66
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,219

67
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,229

68
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,090
can so thank you thank each and every

69
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,009
one of you for all the podcast support

70
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,459
now let's talk about some stuff that's

71
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:26,318
not podcast related I am grateful that I

72
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,789
am in generally good health I know I

73
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,409
sound like [ __ ] today I've got a little

74
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,000
cold big deal that'll go away I took

75
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,829
some medicine I took a lot of vitamins

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,689
I feel the medicine kicking in my palms

77
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,250
are getting super sweaty so this cold

78
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,620
will be knocked out for the most part I

79
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,050
am in good general health mentally and

80
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,480
physically I'm grateful for that I feel

81
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,400
like I'm doing fairly well business-wise

82
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,859
the podcast is part of my business the

83
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,840
podcast is taking off seed sales are

84
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,700
taking off I feel like I read genetics

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,349
is going really far we have spread our

86
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,359
wings quite far we've got a far reach

87
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,949
seeds are going everywhere people are

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,390
really happy with the products the

89
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,429
merchandise is selling quite well

90
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,768
everybody is happy with the company

91
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,110
myself the customers of the vendors

92
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,789
everybody is satisfied it's growing it's

93
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,230
expanding I'm really grateful for that

94
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,818
that was my little dream one day I was

95
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,229
like I'm gonna make a seed company and

96
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,818
look here it is it's happening you guys

97
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,709
I'm doing it so I'm really grateful for

98
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,629
that I set my mind to something I

99
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,849
thought about steps of how to do it and

100
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,919
I took those steps and it is happening

101
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,599
so I'm grateful that my efforts are

102
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,030
finally paying off it's been a long time

103
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,919
but it is doing something now and I see

104
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,390
it I can actually see the growth I can

105
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,609
see the explosion and I'm really

106
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:32,139
grateful for that through the expansion

107
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,660
of my company through social media

108
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,369
through all the things I have done in

109
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,189
the past few months I've made a lot of

110
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,590
new friends some really close friends

111
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:43,810
I'm really grateful for all the friends

112
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,209
I have made locally and through social

113
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,159
media worldwide I talked to a lot of

114
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,109
people that are nowhere near me I've got

115
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,639
friends in other states that I talked to

116
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,100
more than some people that are really

117
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,449
close to me so everybody from the people

118
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,039
in my neighborhood the people in my

119
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,108
house to the people worldwide that I

120
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,090
interact with my little support team my

121
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,070
Friendship Circle I'm [ __ ] super

122
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,229
grateful for each and every one of you

123
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,849
if you've texted me and I've replied if

124
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,469
we've had a conversation that meant

125
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,139
something to me so I'm thankful for you

126
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,639
thank you and I'll talk too much about

127
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,768
my family life on the podcast because

128
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,969
quite frankly that's not what we're here

129
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,930
for we're here to talk about cannabis

130
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:19,870
but I'm talking about what I'm grateful

131
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,150
for I recently had a health scare with a

132
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,829
family member and I am extremely

133
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,810
grateful he pulled through on that he

134
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:27,159
still got a long ways to go but it was

135
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,930
scary as [ __ ] for a couple of

136
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
days there and I'm extremely grateful

137
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,340
that he is okay I'm also super thankful

138
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,939
and grateful that my mom is still in

139
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,709
good health

140
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,779
she's probably my she's certainly my

141
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,459
closest family member my mom's probably

142
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:41,529
my best friend you guys so I'm really

143
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,909
grateful that my mom can be my best

144
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,559
friend and that she is still in good

145
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,420
health because she's not a spring

146
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,889
chicken she's getting up there an age so

147
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,340
I'm really thankful that she's still in

148
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,629
fairly good health also I'm glad my

149
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,279
daughter's doing well I don't talk about

150
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,870
my kid on the show a lot but if I'm

151
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,819
talking about [ __ ] I'm grateful for I'm

152
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,129
really grateful for that kid everything

153
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,870
about her I'm grateful for I feel like

154
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,250
those are most of the big major obvious

155
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,959
points I should be grateful for my

156
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,389
friends my family my loved ones my

157
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,769
business my general health I'm really

158
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,779
grateful for all of that stuff but also

159
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,299
they're random things that make me happy

160
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,939
every day just the fact that I can drive

161
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,199
just about any direction I can go ten

162
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,850
minutes that way I can go ten minutes

163
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,490
that way and I will arrive at a

164
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,710
dispensary that allows me to buy some of

165
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,259
the best cannabis flowers and cannabis

166
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:28,569
concentrates on the planet I am really

167
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,279
grateful for that ability I spent too

168
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,839
many years of my life having to hunt

169
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,579
down some good herb I spent too many

170
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,229
years of my life having to grow good

171
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:36,639
herb just to have it around I spent too

172
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,530
many years of my life having to watch

173
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,750
over my shoulder because I consume

174
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:43,000
cannabis so I'm really grateful for the

175
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,709
situation that we are in with cannabis

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,910
now of course things could be different

177
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,099
there are some things I would adjust

178
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,660
with the rules I would raise plant

179
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,160
counts I would make a lot of things a

180
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,189
little bit different but I am grateful

181
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,590
that I am able to acquire the stuff that

182
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,389
I enjoy and not have to feel like a

183
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,009
criminal something random that I'm

184
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:01,959
suddenly grateful for I can feel this

185
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,240
medicine I took starting to work my

186
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,529
sinuses are loosening up I'm starting to

187
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,650
feel a lot better so I'm definitely

188
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:10,839
grateful that I have access to medicine

189
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,310
that when I am not feeling well I know

190
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,929
I'm stubborn I don't take medicine so

191
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,149
I'm about to die but I really needed

192
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,650
some I finally took it and I feel much

193
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,349
better already so I'm grateful for that

194
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:22,029
stuff working another random thing that

195
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,330
I'm really thankful and grateful for is

196
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,099
my ability to play the drums I'm very

197
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:28,779
musical on the drums I'm very gifted on

198
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,730
the drums I'm not trying to brag I am

199
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,769
more grateful than bragging about it

200
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,259
right now that is something that I am

201
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:37,329
really proud of and I feel like I am

202
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,740
blessed to be able to play the drums the

203
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,269
way that I do so I'm absolutely grateful

204
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,870
on that that really feels like a humble

205
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:43,120
brag but

206
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,129
I'm so grateful because a lot of my wife

207
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,389
I made a living playing the drums I

208
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,980
travelled around the country playing the

209
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,810
drums I got paid playing the drums I

210
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,910
learned how I guess I kind of learned a

211
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,160
lot about business being sort of the

212
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,840
band manager I'm the obnoxious guy in

213
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,550
the group most of the time I'm the big

214
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,989
guy in the group a lot of the times so I

215
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,639
would be the guy that was sent to tell

216
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,960
the club owner [ __ ] you pay me when

217
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,479
things didn't go right so I learned a

218
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,009
lot about business by being in a band

219
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,050
and being the drummer so I'm grateful

220
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,610
that I had the skills to be a drummer

221
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,980
that took me places and I'm also

222
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,379
grateful that I learned some business

223
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,960
throughout that process and of course I

224
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,120
am super super grateful and thankful for

225
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,759
the skills I have acquired and developed

226
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,530
within the cannabis industry this plant

227
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,329
has taken me far and I owe a great

228
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,189
respect to the cannabis plant so I'm

229
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,199
grateful for the plant I'm grateful for

230
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,699
the industry like I said earlier there

231
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,250
are several things I would change about

232
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,360
legalization there are so many things I

233
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,430
would change about the cannabis industry

234
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,230
but overall I'm grateful that the

235
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,060
cannabis industry even exists and I'm

236
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,650
grateful to be involved in it on any

237
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,079
level and I'm grateful to have been

238
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:46,509
accepted by so many people as a teacher

239
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,310
as an advocate and somebody that people

240
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,750
look up to and respect in the cannabis

241
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,600
industry I'm really thankful and

242
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,920
grateful for all of that and one last

243
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,270
thing just to wrap this up because my

244
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,199
voice sounds like [ __ ] and I think this

245
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,269
is getting long enough

246
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,089
I am super grateful to live in this age

247
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,159
of information and technology you should

248
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,199
never say I wonder because there's no

249
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,150
need to wonder there's a device in most

250
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,370
of our pockets we can pull it out and we

251
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,049
can find the answer to almost anything

252
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,370
you wonder of course there's some

253
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,430
existential [ __ ] you should always

254
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,160
wonder the most facts most info it's in

255
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,800
