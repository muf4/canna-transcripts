right guys

45
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,530
Jessie is here because a lot of people

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,240
on social media have been asking him to

47
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,820
come back on the show and talk about

48
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,228
no-till beds so we're going to talk

49
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,298
about no-till you just want to jump

50
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,099
right into it bro sure cool

51
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,920
first of all maybe we should explain

52
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,438
what no-till is let's talk about maybe

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,820
what no-till is and how it varies from a

54
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,250
lot of the traditional methods that I

55
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,629
talked about and how most people are

56
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,590
taught how to well maybe not how most

57
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:00,478
people are taught to do if they're

58
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,770
taught if they're on a farm or if they

59
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,828
live in a way they were probably taught

60
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:08,409
no-till no-till in the cannabis industry

61
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:11,729
that turn gets confused so much

62
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:13,299
it's yeah there's a big misunderstanding

63
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,349
about it

64
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,900
no-till in real big AG is completely

65
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:22,539
different practices than then raised

66
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,539
beds and whatnot but not to knock you

67
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,340
know what we're doing it's just a

68
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:32,019
misunderstanding of the term okay

69
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,479
also permaculture that's one it's yeah I

70
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,909
see permaculture get just tagged on all

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,229
kinds of stuff that isn't permaculture I

72
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,629
think for a while I was using

73
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,590
permaculture wrong I think Ted Hussey is

74
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,519
the only person that actually

75
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,849
understands what permaculture yeah yeah

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,009
it's it's a design plan it's a way to

77
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,239
work a piece of land you know it's not

78
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:56,799
really something you know pull off in

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,469
your basement okay um you know it's it's

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,790
a whole practice

81
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,659
yeah she's got farming chessboard

82
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:06,189
essentially yeah yeah and I slightly

83
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,469
understand it from because of that but

84
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,469
yeah yeah it just biggest msconfig

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,169
that people are chiming in most of my

86
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,419
people they listen I have taught them to

87
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,250
grow with bottled nutrients because

88
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,539
that's what I'm mostly familiar with so

89
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,489
we need to tell them kind of what

90
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,349
no-till is and how it's different from

91
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,680
grown with the bottle of nutrients so

92
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,699
from what I see mostly in cannabis a

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,969
no-till

94
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:46,479
cannabis bed seems to be a raised bed

95
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:52,299
with a large amount of soil in it that

96
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:57,518
is you know good amended organic soil

97
00:03:52,299 --> 00:04:00,800
okay and it you know it's it's awesome

98
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,519
what it is says you know it's no-till so

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,450
[Music]

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,359
tilling is not really something I think

101
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,369
a lot of pot growers actually do with

102
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,680
the rototiller you know I think a pot

103
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,959
growers version of tilling is to dump it

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,730
out buy new yeah finds a way somewhere

105
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,199
to get rid of all of this and then buy

106
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,098
brand new at the store is our version

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,420
for sure

108
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,219
so to me

109
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,189
what I see it means that they're reusing

110
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,550
their soil so they're you know they're

111
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:29,759
they're doing things to build soil you

112
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,810
know to protect it with cover crops

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,449
chopping chop and drop having worms in

114
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,939
there eating stuff you know all kinds of

115
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,610
biology in the soil not feeding it

116
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:45,610
bottled nutrients and you know top

117
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:49,480
dressing with amendments compost you

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,189
know feeding compost teas you know so

119
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,340
that's what I see

120
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,290
no-till is in cannabis okay but this

121
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,029
gives me a good start of places to ask

122
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,670
questions it sounds like it all starts

123
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:04,179
with our no-till bed and can we also do

124
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,500
this in large pots for sure I recommend

125
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,670
the beds it seems to be like what you

126
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,079
talked about a lot and that seems to be

127
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,689
what the people on Instagram are asking

128
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,959
about - yeah the bigger amount of the

129
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:16,449
you know the larger amount of soil you

130
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,709
can work with the better it's gonna work

131
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,360
trying to create in life so you need

132
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,129
more space for more life the more stuff

133
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,050
the more activity the more space more

134
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,139
life right for sure and I mean honestly

135
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,900
you could even apply these practices

136
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,479
directly to the ground - in ground

137
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:34,949
planted stuff and and honestly that's

138
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,379
where you're gonna make the most impact

139
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:41,729
as far as like restoring restoring soil

140
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:44,529
in this earth right you know long-term

141
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,300
okay so end of the world scenario this

142
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,479
would be the way to go for sure all

143
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,819
right

144
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,030
yeah you seem like the type of guy to

145
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,790
build your own raised beds definitely so

146
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,259
we've get out of the you know everything

147
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,140
I'm talking about pretty much is

148
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,060
representing the project that we got

149
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:09,069
going on it might work right now okay

150
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:12,449
so we've built their 5 by 8 and 5 by 16

151
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:18,599
linked beds out of two by eights

152
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:20,949
there's 16 inches deep so sure no my bad

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,950
hey they're not two by eights they're

154
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,959
two by two by twelves okay so yeah

155
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,959
pretty sturdy there yeah 24 inches deep

156
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,719
but it's just a basic box built out of

157
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,938
wood you know

158
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,710
square box things are they on wheels are

159
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,659
they stuck in place no no they're on the

160
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,718
ground okay so we covered the bottom

161
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:43,788
with the weed fabric to keep the soil

162
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:45,709
from running and falling out yeah

163
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:48,860
just stable with it to the inside of the

164
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,810
bed filled with our soil and rock and

165
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,479
roll basically just made a big wood pot

166
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,209
and made the use the weed film as the

167
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,550
bottom of the pot right easy enough

168
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,709
fill that up with your awesome soil yeah

169
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,968
do you recommend a certain type of soil

170
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,198
is there something that if they're gonna

171
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,000
go shopping or if they're gonna make a

172
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,900
shopping list certain kind they can put

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
on there just to make it easy for

174
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:11,959
themselves I mean get to get the best

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,538
you can you want something with a lot of

176
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:19,549
organic matter in it you know for a long

177
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:22,399
term and yep just just get the best soil

178
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,050
you can I mention that's a perfect I try

179
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,098
to avoid brand names unless there's

180
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,870
somebody that yeah that I really

181
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:29,180
recommend okay so we've got a raised bed

182
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,528
we've got a 5 by 8 or a 5 by 16 you guys

183
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,079
you can make whatever size raised beds

184
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:35,269
work well for you I saw a guy on social

185
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,430
media who is a smaller fella and he has

186
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,038
made some raised beds that are actually

187
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,718
5 by 5 by 5 but he put a little Inlet in

188
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,370
the middle so he can walk into the

189
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:45,680
middle of it because he can't reach to

190
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,180
work canopy and stuff he decided and he

191
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,918
can fit them together like Tetris pieces

192
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,259
yeah so it looks pretty nice and his bro

193
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,149
set up but they're on wheels also so you

194
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,028
can make whatever size and shape raised

195
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,439
beds you like you can do it in pots you

196
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,639
can do it in small pots you can do it in

197
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,800
large pots well we're gonna talk about

198
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,829
is mostly going to be in these raised

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,598
beds so we've got the bottom in there

200
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:09,019
we've got soil in there what else are we

201
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:11,389
going to put into our no-till mix what

202
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:16,278
kind of amendments are we gonna add in I

203
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:20,379
mean what we did is we just we use a dry

204
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:23,899
powder nutrient that before we were

205
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,939
every week when we were amending so old

206
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:28,218
toil at the end of a cycle you know you

207
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,408
dump it out of the bags we'd have more

208
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:32,990
compost and more of our powder nutrient

209
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:36,168
okay so we just we started with that

210
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,948
basic mix that we use of you know it's

211
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:41,598
like a five for two nutrient you know

212
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:43,029
once I'm not gonna mention names but

213
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,110
it's just

214
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:49,449
it's like kelp and [ __ ] crab shell

215
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,570
mill and that's what I'm looking for as

216
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:56,259
a Gill crab shell so we just use an

217
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,000
all-in-one you know just to agricultural

218
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,080
nutrients okay so there's something

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,340
that's available if they do a little

220
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,360
research they'll probably find that

221
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,250
product you're talking about

222
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,450
definitely yeah it's a it's got kelp

223
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,190
meal there's crab meal

224
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,720
there's azomite in there would you add

225
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,420
some worm castings there's that included

226
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:15,129
in this product no no so I would also

227
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:17,019
add you know we normally do probably

228
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:21,429
like a quarter yard of compost or worm

229
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:24,909
castings every week you know so you know

230
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:29,409
I'm talking about a like a 20 yard pile

231
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:31,000
of soil here so I think no no I'm

232
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:33,219
definitely talking about a 20 yard Bell

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,769
soil so we're adding in more like the

234
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,660
yard I'm gonna come Otacon this is stuff

235
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,090
you know it's been getting this week

236
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,559
after week after week so leave for some

237
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,850
room in your no-till bed you guys

238
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,899
because you're gonna need to top dress

239
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,070
and you're gonna be adding stuff in

240
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,299
there but at the same time the plants

241
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,560
are gonna eat that up so some of its

242
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,240
gonna go some of its gonna add in

243
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,619
believe some room don't fill all the way

244
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,060
up to the top I never recommend you fill

245
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,009
your pots all the way to the top anyway

246
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,989
you want water room you want more ahead

247
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,919
in space should you meet it so don't go

248
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,629
all the way to the top and you're

249
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,889
filling your raised beds so we've got

250
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,870
some compost we've got some worm

251
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,179
castings we've got this agricultural mix

252
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,490

253
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,719
crab meal kelp meal blood meal fish meal

255
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,820

257
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,660
these other things to your mix at your

258
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,030
discretion if you would like you can

259
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,429
find tons of recipes online for making a

260
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,220
no-till bed i think bill the soil will

261
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,659
have a great recipe I'm pretty sure

262
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,060
Clackamas coop probably has some recipes

263
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,889
available you can design your own recipe

264
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:28,000
we're gonna leave a little work up to

265
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,470
you but we're gonna give you a good

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,149
guideline on how to do this I'm not

267
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,200
gonna point you in all the product

268
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,179
directions but we'll give you a pretty

269
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:40,390
good guideline don't get caught up with

270
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:42,759
trendy stuff it's it's not the the name

271
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,189
of the label of the product that makes

272
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,799
this work so I've noticed when you go to

273
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,720
the farm store and the big horticultural

274
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,599
store well that worked out hard there

275
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,220
aren't really cool logos on the products

276
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,590
there's no pretty babes on the

277
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,930
advertising it is a white van

278
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,330
and it says like potassium phosphate

279
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,859
that's what's in that bag it's not a

280
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,050
bunch of water and a bunch of other [ __ ]

281
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,820
so yeah don't be sold on trendy names

282
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,419
don't be sold on advertising don't worry

283
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,100
about that

284
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:11,500
get the things that we need for the

285
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,230
garden you want the these are what the

286
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,940
people who before they were farming to

287
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,350
survive before they ever had cool

288
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,600
labeling and these are the products that

289
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,490
the farmers are using so and farmers are

290
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,990
farming to survive they've got much more

291
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:28,930
on the line than a cannabis grower oh

292
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:34,180
yeah they're feeding the country you

293
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:36,939
know yeah yeah yeah but yeah I mean the

294
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,359
the I feel like the amount of soil that

295
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,850
you have is more important than then

296
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,539
what you put in it as long as it's well

297
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,540
amended okay um and end your compost is

298
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,759
key get the best compost or worm

299
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:54,699
castings you can find there you go the

300
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,679
best worm castings you can find but try

301
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,820
to find a local worm casting company so

302
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,509
they're nice and fresh they're nice and

303
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,520
alive

304
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,230
you should find a couple of live worms

305
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,939
in your castings if you've got a quality

306
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,529
company there will be worms in there

307
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,950
they'll still be wiggling around when

308
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,870
they get to you so we've got a basic

309
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:15,970
idea of what goes into our mix does this

310
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:19,570
need any cook time yes and no okay I

311
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,009
mean I yeah if you can let it let it

312
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,000
chill for a couple weeks

313
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:27,100
keep it well watered but you don't have

314
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,179
to I mean you throw plants right in here

315
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,769
and then it's gonna start doing its

316
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,539
thing and one of the things I hear about

317
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:34,360
no-till is it gets better every single

318
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,709
time in theory in theory if you do if we

319
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,750
do it correctly we should get better

320
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,220
every time okay so the first time we can

321
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,620
let it cook for a couple of weeks or we

322
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,840
can mix up our no-till bed and we can

323
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,500
throw our plants in on day one now if

324
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,320
we'd like to yeah okay we have we didn't

325
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,700
have any results

326
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,900
we're not the one of the main

327
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,580
differences here is we're not gonna

328
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,899
force-feed these plants like we would be

329
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,009
with bottles but the bottles you're kind

330
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,629
of force-feeding they don't get to

331
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,220
decide what they take in because

332
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,019
everything's been buffered and chelated

333
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,790
here it's organic the roots run around

334
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,740
they go huh oh look nitrogen I'm gonna

335
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,179
eat up some of that phosphorus cool I

336
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,159
don't need me so much phosphorus hey

337
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,299
guys do we need potassium up there no

338
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,980
we're good on potassium let's just

339
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,419
this nitrogen for now guys believe that

340
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,560
potassium behind we know it's here we

341
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,909
can come get that when we need it the

342
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,259
plant eats it will when you're feeding

343
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,850
it bottled nutrients you're basically

344
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,389
going eat [ __ ] and you're forced

345
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,889
feeding it

346
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,289
it's got eat what you feed it that's how

347
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:24,699
you get those burns so sounds like we'll

348
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,329
be safe just going right into our

349
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,540
no-till soil mix just don't amend it so

350
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,660
much that it would heat up you know so

351
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:36,189
with no-till you know you just were

352
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:38,649
constantly topdressing

353
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,600
we talked to us those beds at work every

354
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,159
other week so I think I may have been

355
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,899
going into this thinking it's too much

356
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,490
like a super soil in the beginning I

357
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,679
need to back my brain out of the super

358
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,350
soil idea and not put so much in in the

359
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,269
beginning and just going definitely okay

360
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,500
all right so I was thinking sort of a

361
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,939
wrong direction with this I had to

362
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,490
correct my thought process and I think I

363
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,290
just realized that the super soil I was

364
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,600
combining no-till and super sorry I mean

365
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:04,269
you could start with well I wouldn't

366
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,460
start with the de su personal recipe but

367
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:10,689
that's another term that has been

368
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,330
diluted so I you know back in the day

369
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,850
super soil mint sub cool but now super

370
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,740
soil could mean a hundred different

371
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,340
[ __ ] alright I've seen so many things

372
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,919
advertised as super soil and you know

373
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,990
it's just is so is confusing okay so

374
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,490
I've got to get my brain out of the idea

375
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,250
of thinking that this was similar to

376
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,990
building a that you premix and then you

377
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,149
just water basically till the end yeah

378
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,620
we're gonna be more amending and top

379
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,819
dressing to keep this going and keeping

380
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,620
it fresh for sure

381
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,940
okay let's that correct my thought

382
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,379
process and they'll change my line of

383
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,390
questioning for you a little bit too

384
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,590
awesome alright so you guys we all

385
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,870
learned something today that's the fun

386
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,730
of this podcast so I like the the beds

387
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,590
that we have at work that have been on

388
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,659
the steady top dressing regimen you can

389
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,879
dig down into the top just a little bit

390
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,129
and there are just millions of [ __ ]

391
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,649
worms that's eating that [ __ ] up yeah

392
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:04,269
[ __ ] and if you look underneath the

393
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,699
worms a little bit it's [ __ ] worm

394
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,370
castings I mean it's like a goddamn

395
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,990
[ __ ] worm casting Factory okay it's

396
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,629
it's amazing man it's I've never done

397
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,620
no-till with this success or on this

398
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,049
level before

399
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,210
every day I go in I'm just like [ __ ]

400
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,469
what am I gonna see today it's [ __ ]

401
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,879
exhaust man

402
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,550
and there's awesome diggity mushrooms

403
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,500
that grow out of it no no yeah no yeah

404
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,819
but maybe in the future you grabbed his

405
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,450
phone when I said that with excitement

406
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,450
that was cool

407
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:48,019
I don't have that type of charger yeah

408
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:49,189
it's even if you did I love when

409
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,289
companies do that now you have to buy

410
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,180
new [ __ ] alright so we've got an idea

411
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,529
what goes in at first we don't have to

412
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:56,239
cook it we can throw some plants in

413
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,220
there now let's talk about these things

414
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,169
we keep talking about should we go over

415
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,410
a cover crop or top dressing first oh

416
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,539
wow he's showing me the mycelium layer

417
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:07,699
is that alfalfa or clover growing there

418
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,500
that's clover he's got clover growing

419
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,759
out of the soil here he's got some stuff

420
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,649
that is sprouted there are things that

421
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,039
are ready to sprout so that's like

422
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:19,669
malted barley and the the mycelium just

423
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,490
grows off the valley and if you lift up

424
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,469
that barley there's just like all kinds

425
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,930
of little baby worms in there that's

426
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,399
amazing on his phone I think the area

427
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:30,469
that I can see is about a foot by a foot

428
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,419
square probably and there is a small

429
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,639
environment that is a life cycle

430
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,990
happening on that little photo yeah you

431
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,819
could take that somewhere and create

432
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,560
life if you took that to a planet you'd

433
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,890
have existence on that planet in a few

434
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,909
weeks

435
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,860
yes I totally would I'm all looking at

436
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:47,000
it think think that kind of [ __ ] yeah

437
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,550
that's I think that's where the weed

438
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,139
grows the people that think about little

439
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,359
microorganisms that's just where we've

440
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,370
gone now we've grown so much like oh

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,029
there's so much life right there yeah I

442
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,100
love it

443
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:01,549
our friend frosty would say life bro I

444
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:07,099
love it just so much like think of the

445
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:08,750
dude from Jurassic burg life always all

446
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,169
right should we talk about cover crop or

447
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,319
tea first

448
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:19,250
or top dress cover crop there are some

449
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,759
mainstream popular cover crop blends and

450
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:25,190
I don't like any of them they they have

451
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,619
plants in them that in my opinion don't

452
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,580
really work well with indoor cannabis or

453
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:34,158
greenhouse Canada

454
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:37,308
so currently I'm just using a white

455
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:40,179
Dutch clover okay clover at the

456
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:42,740
agricultural store by the pound I mean

457
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,120
yeah it looks like it works like four

458
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,470
bucks of pounders it looks like it's

459
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,089
working hey just sprinkle that in there

460
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,740
and it grows naturally out of the top as

461
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:50,599
you water in it falls in and works like

462
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,929
nature works definitely again right

463
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,959
before harvest we chop it and we mulch

464
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:59,480
the bed with it and I guess chill for a

465
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,569
week for him to come up eat it we put

466
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,589
the barley into the the Bart the malted

467
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:09,259
barley powder is like warm magnet

468
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:11,689
wherever we put it worm show up so

469
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,940
that's awesome yeah it's [ __ ] it's so

470
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,769
rad sprinkle some of that in and watch

471
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,929
the worms come do their work yep and

472
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:20,599
then it also grows the mycelium yeah and

473
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,399
it breaks down that waste to just I mean

474
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,829
I know these are just indoor beds but

475
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:26,629
we're literally building topsoil yeah

476
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,879
the picture you showed me is better than

477
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,070
any soil you can buy yeah okay anything

478
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,590
like that that's that looks like it but

479
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:36,079
the little area by the park about 20

480
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:37,939
feet away from where the little stream

481
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,398
runs through it's got that real moist

482
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,750
soil is soil kind of area it's getting a

483
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:43,548
little funk on it's kind of swampy

484
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,308
that's what you've built right there is

485
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:48,319
that type of environment so we haven't

486
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:52,788
made a lot of it yet but we're actually

487
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:56,509
making our own compost on-site out of

488
00:18:52,788 --> 00:19:00,619
just chicken [ __ ] and cannabis waste

489
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:02,990
awesome I made about a half yard so I

490
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,278
think I saw a picture of it it really I

491
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,138
saw you looming through it and looked

492
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:12,048
really fluffy and it's everything that

493
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:14,298
we've put it on just yeah it's I love

494
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:16,819
your farm style yeah it's so far from

495
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:18,500
how I learned and how I was taught it's

496
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:20,269
fascinating to me I understand it but

497
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,148
I'm still like wow I want to play that

498
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,528
way just so far from all of every like

499
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:26,239
just how I learned you know I've learned

500
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:28,759
with bottles and I was taught with

501
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,230
bottle I mean tozai yeah it's like

502
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,839
leaving karate school and going to

503
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,278
jiu-jitsu after all around on the ground

504
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,148
this sucks

505
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:40,250
can't breathe all right so how about a

506
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:40,969
so we've got a little white some Dutch

507
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,109
white clover

508
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,308
we've got some malted barley

509
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,599
just sprinkle in that and there how

510
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:49,879
often do we want to do that about once a

511
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:52,159
week malted barley well the the clove

512
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,890
replant that once okay

513
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,798
I recommend well not just once but like

514
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,740
once per cycle okay once per cycle so I

515
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,250
recommend just planning it after you

516
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,230
then plant your your cannabis plants

517
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,710
okay so it'll just fill it around it

518
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,179
yeah yeah alright and you know look for

519
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,679
other plants you're interested in

520
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:17,330
growing and if you got a big enough

521
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,759
container to fit them in there man it's

522
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,579
this is a random question since we're

523
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,650
adding cover crop but we're also adding

524
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,359
we're adding cover so we're shading the

525
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,490
topsoil we're creating a little layer

526
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,689
we're also adding more plants that are

527
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,130
eating from that layer do we do you

528
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,980
water more or less frequently do you

529
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,900
find yourself in a no-till environment

530
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,759
the beds that have cover crop use less

531
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,929
water okay that's gonna help cuz you're

532
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,369
getting shade you're got something to

533
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,380
trap that water in there less

534
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,579
evaporation and then less light okay

535
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,720
that's a cool thing that's gonna happen

536
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:48,889
for you it's another day out of it yeah

537
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,390
people are going a whole day yeah in a

538
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,440
commercial environment bro a whole day

539
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:57,830
is changed yeah we might have talked a

540
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,929
little bit about that and then we're

541
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:04,329
gonna get irrigation on that too so that

542
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:07,429
it's it's going to be insane how much

543
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,000
how little work it's gonna take that's

544
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,720
awesome

545
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,589
all the works gonna be just like

546
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,839
specifically to the plant

547
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:19,339
you know not not worry about water and

548
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,709
where exactly where to put what top

549
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,990
dress and exactly how to time it and

550
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,779
then where to prune and lollipop and pop

551
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,690
into it can't do you do trellising and

552
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:32,960
stuff also so we're working on building

553
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,640
a trellis in game awesome we're learning

554
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,169
a lot we're getting we're getting better

555
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,000
at it I've loved trellising well if you

556
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,559
know some guidance just ask for Sean I

557
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,750
was taught by a person who's really good

558
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,529
at trellising I was very good at it yeah

559
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,569
I used to do six foot wide by 75 foot

560
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,970
strips if just one piece of net all the

561
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:53,119
way down yeah it was that's people hated

562
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,740
it I loved it gonna work them in it's so

563
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,979
much

564
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,480
all right so we've got some white Dutch

565
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,849
white clover we've got our malted barley

566
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,000
we've talked about worm castings in the

567
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:06,459
mix we have got some compost in the mix

568
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,409
Oh what else are we gonna need to add in

569
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,028
as things go on are we gonna be set to

570
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,039
jet until harvest time what that makes

571
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,148
in there so I make it tea every other

572
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,648
week okay

573
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:19,989
just basically compost and compost and

574
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:22,028
or castings and molasses

575
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,130
fungal dominant team and get in there

576
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:26,619
and get the roots all activated of

577
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,140
microbes and get it living up a little

578
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:31,089
coke yeah pretty much

579
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,770
that's it I think the kelp will help

580
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,359
with your your flavor and your density

581
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,710
and the aroma for sure

582
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,349
I always think kelp helps with flavor

583
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:43,350
and density and aroma yeah it helps

584
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:46,148
encourage mycelium good yeah nature I

585
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,129
like ocean products in the grow all

586
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:49,509
right so basically now you've just got

587
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,770
to keep it wet and then give it the tea

588
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:53,349
and make sure none of the top stuff

589
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,288
starts dying off on you yeah keeping it

590
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:58,480
healthy yeah and then harvest time comes

591
00:22:55,288 --> 00:23:00,429
then you chop right yeah but what are

592
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,659
people gonna say about not flushing a

593
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,679
no-tell that's what I'm curious about

594
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:07,090
there's no flush time it's all organic

595
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,950
so we're not forced feeding it anything

596
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,538
so there's no built-up salt and residues

597
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,740
to flush out while my computer just went

598
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:15,129
into a screen saver we're still

599
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,069
recording that's cool we we quit feeding

600
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,320
teas you know a few weeks before but the

601
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:24,579
the plants are a few weeks before

602
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,470
harvest but the plants are going through

603
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:28,480
a fade and everything you know all right

604
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,769
just like just like they naturally would

605
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
because they're like I said earlier

606
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,230
we're not forced feeding them they're

607
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,940
just they're only taking up they go oh

608
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,860
it's probably the end of my cycle I

609
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,899
better start finishing up here I've been

610
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:40,028
flowering for nine weeks for sure all

611
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:41,979
right that makes sense to me so harvest

612
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:43,480
time comes we chopped down our plants to

613
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,339
plant disappears that's a whole nother

614
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,048
podcast episode you guys are harvest

615
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,720
drank your episodes to listen to you can

616
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:51,519
go listen to those we're gonna focus on

617
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,589
what happens to the no-till soil after

618
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,329
the trim crew has taken the plant out of

619
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:56,949
the room we've got a little stock

620
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,359
sticking up out of the plant you just

621
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,460
get like a little Spade and kind of cut

622
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,619
a tiny circle and cut that root ball out

623
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,210
or he does yank it out yeah just pretty

624
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:06,558
much Hank you don't yank it out distill

625
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,019
leaves because you want to leave organic

626
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,359
do in there okay so it's still leaves

627
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:13,490
plenty a root system behind you just let

628
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,019
the worm castings and everything else

629
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,298
does take care of that for you yeah all

630
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,429
that organic matter terms it turns into

631
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:22,038
warm food all right it gets broken down

632
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,950
and turned it back into nutrient and it

633
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,359
just is there any time between see we've

634
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,919
harvested everything we go through and

635
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,628
pull out all the basically pull out the

636
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,429
sticks now is there any time between

637
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:35,298
putting new plants in there we just put

638
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:39,710
them right back in I mean yes and no

639
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:43,220
okay so I'm divot you know the the true

640
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:47,169
spirit in no-till you would want to let

641
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:50,419
it rest for I mean at least a month okay

642
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:52,639
you know true spirit of no-till it'll be

643
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:55,730
more agriculture you know traditional AG

644
00:24:52,638 --> 00:25:01,459
so it's gonna rest you know an entire

645
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:04,730
season yeah like a lot of the I won't go

646
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,110
to that but yeah I mean so commercial

647
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,450
no-till is a little different because

648
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:11,089
you know figuring out the balance he

649
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,730
keeping nutrient and health in the bed

650
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,839
plus keeping up productivity right cuz

651
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,149
you can't just have half your farm

652
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:23,868
shelling for a season with no gas yeah

653
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:25,548
yeah so can you tell us what you do to

654
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:30,980
how your house what's your uh what's the

655
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:33,168
word at your compromise so we're really

656
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,710
ideally we're shooting for a week arrest

657
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:40,970
okay we we cover the same day we harvest

658
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:44,419
we give a real nice layer compost we

659
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,700
chopped cover crop we we mulch

660
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:50,330
use it to mulch it okay so it just stays

661
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,100
right in there yeah and yeah and they

662
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,808
gets a healthy dose of barley that day

663
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:58,538
so everything just kind of starts

664
00:25:53,808 --> 00:26:02,058
breaking down ideally we'll you know

665
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:05,710
we'll get at least a week so okay

666
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:08,418
hopefully see how that goes right

667
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,509
but yeah I don't know it's gonna work

668
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:13,669
we'll see I hope it goes well for you

669
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:15,409
yeah I'm seeing you're brainstorming I'm

670
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:18,110
like you know what if you really should

671
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,710
be Mart is still cooking and it's still

672
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:22,019
cooking all three

673
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,299
ideally you know I was like I'd like to

674
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,879
see like four weeks but you know that's

675
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,909
just not practical for for this

676
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,470
situation do you think that uh-oh it's

677
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,450
not because the things are breaking down

678
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,860
the dying root matter who's gonna ask if

679
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,630
you think that that whole four by four

680
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,189
or five by when we have a five by eight

681
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,690
that five by eight bed do you think that

682
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,910
thing is it looks like when you pull a

683
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,410
plant out of a pot oh it's got roots

684
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,480
just thick everywhere you think that

685
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,670
whole section is just Rudy like that

686
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,930
no because things are eating it and

687
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,890
decaying it right okay yeah all right

688
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,870
like I said earlier this is fascinating

689
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,610
together they envision what's going on

690
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:58,349
toward the bottom of that cuz I can

691
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:01,019
totally envision what's happening about

692
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:02,279
a foot in pusher two feet in I'm not

693
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,009
sure what's going on that far into that

694
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,289
soil yeah yeah yeah so that's like

695
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:12,119
another part of our talking about the

696
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,740
depth so I mean true true no-till I feel

697
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,619
like we'd be putting a clone in or I

698
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,559
shouldn't say true but the way most

699
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:21,119
people know till they so when they

700
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,970
replant the bed they're just putting a

701
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,719
little tiny clone when we replant it I'm

702
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,000
putting in you know of 24 to 36 inch

703
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,480
okay plans are it's ready to flower yeah

704
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,430
they're ready to flip yeah so so to put

705
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,960
you know they're in a two gallon pot so

706
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:41,490
basically we till the top foot of the

707
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,710
bed

708
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,049
and you know that that's gonna react all

709
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,750
kinds of you know the biological [ __ ]

710
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:50,309
right and built up but at the same time

711
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,109
you're introducing fresh stuff with it

712
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,789
right for sure okay so it's worth it

713
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:59,849
then you know that's another one of the

714
00:27:53,789 --> 00:28:02,069
challenges of no-till commercial so in a

715
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:06,209
place that has to August 52 times a year

716
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:07,980
so it sounds like you've got a pretty

717
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,019
good hold on it a good idea of how to

718
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,549
make it work I'm faithful that as long

719
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,710
as you keep reom ending that you'll be

720
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,730
able to keep running that bed virtually

721
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,329
that should be forever

722
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:20,490
definitely I'm gonna work some soil test

723
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:22,589
being a grower that was growing in home

724
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,140
gross for a long time back in the day in

725
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:26,549
Colorado you guys we can run a lot of

726
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,070
plants you could go to the doctor you

727
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,930
could say my neck and my back my neck my

728
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:32,429
back and they would say well then you

729
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,049
need to grow 99 plants who's your

730
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,120
medical

731
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:38,750
and honestly you'd say my money and my

732
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,119
back well it's too fat it's [ __ ] my

733
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,619
back exactly they solve your problem

734
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,539
leave five of those hundreds at the

735
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,839
counter and you can have 99 plants in

736
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:50,149
your house yes sir imagine having 99

737
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,639
three gallon pots worth of soil to get

738
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,200
rid of every 60 days and you're trying

739
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,460
to be slightly discreet about it because

740
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,410
you don't need anybody in the neighbors

741
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,880
know that you've got 99 plants down

742
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,140
there yeah they got a little

743
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,390
nerve-wracking if you're running the

744
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,820
no-till you don't just leave that pot

745
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:08,810
right there forever I'll probably never

746
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:09,980
do another non no-till style girl Wow

747
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:14,059
Wow

748
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,130
it's uh it's super [ __ ] easy so it's

749
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,700
you guys heard it from Jessie it's super

750
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,980
[ __ ] easy yeah he's just I mean you

751
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,049
gotta have the right amount of soil

752
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:28,370
you're not gonna pull off real no-till

753
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:33,079
they're like a 20 gallon I'm thinking

754
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:34,759
like 50 200 gallons at least okay like a

755
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,119
kiddie pool in the closet maybe yeah

756
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,190
maybe

757
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,719
all right and a small she'd want to go

758
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,590
there's some of those companies that

759
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,670
make the Smart Pot style raised no-till

760
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:49,039
beds oh yeah those uh that build a soil

761
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:52,130
place I got a couple demo tents rockin

762
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,170
with with them that [ __ ] looks good you

763
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,000
know yes if you're in the area go check

764
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,440
out build a soil I don't work with them

765
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,779
they don't pay me it's just a cool place

766
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,519
yeah this growers working for growers

767
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:02,869
which is that sounds cheesy but that's

768
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:11,359
why it's cool because there are growers

769
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:16,009
yeah hey bro hey bro careful there I've

770
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:18,139
called out there couple times a bit we

771
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:21,049
went up on a Saturday to pick up soil

772
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,930
once many moons ago that was kinda it's

773
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,440
kind of funny I like some of the grow

774
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,740
checks

775
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,750
I've had a lot of fun let's see we've

776
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,279
covered most of the stuff bro we covered

777
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,730
cover crop we covered top dressing we

778
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,710
talked about feeding it a tee one of the

779
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,019
major questions that you've got was is

780
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,490
it cost-effective in a commercial

781
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,839
environment so far have you found it to

782
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:46,490
be cost-effective I know it's only your

783
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:49,859
first run I believe so okay definitely

784
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:52,950
you know in half a year

785
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:57,928
I'll have concrete evidence but you know

786
00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:00,269
that's so far in your is so far in your

787
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,009
flowering phase does it look like your

788
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:03,240
weight is going to be comparable to what

789
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:05,579
you're familiar with in your original

790
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,288
your other styles that you grow this

791
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:12,240
harvest I think it's maybe just a little

792
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:14,490
bit bigger and you know and I didn't

793
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,288
really know I mean I knew what I wanted

794
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:20,308
to do but I hadn't worked out a lot of

795
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:21,929
the like the feeding schedule and stuff

796
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:25,558
like that

797
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:29,330
when we first started it I I started

798
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:32,519
really light you know I didn't want to

799
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:35,189
overload the soil or you know lock it

800
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,808
out or anything like that and that's the

801
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,460
exact opposite of what a lot of people

802
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:43,710
will do on their first try yeah yeah

803
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,269
more so or we definitely got yielded as

804
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,179
much as we did when we were going in the

805
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:51,269
pods so he's in a little bit of we used

806
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,380
by OBE is a little bit so okay yeah to

807
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:54,538
go product yeah

808
00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:00,440
thanks Steph tastes real nice so in the

809
00:31:54,538 --> 00:32:02,879
beds the reason three liquid products

810
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,360
and we didn't use any of those in the

811
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,549
bed so and you know so we've got

812
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,349
probably a little bit more all right

813
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:11,940
yeah you know that works out really good

814
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:13,678
it sounds like the cost of what you're

815
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,419
putting into it is way cheaper than

816
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,130
going and buying or having a bunch of

817
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,630
nutrients delivered you don't have to

818
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,520
pay for all the extra stuff that's in

819
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,440
the news that you don't need you're not

820
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,690
buying a brand name every commercial

821
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,970
girl around here is using one of three

822
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,679
very specific brand names probably for I

823
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,110
think of four specific brands that are

824
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,090
very popular in all the rows and they're

825
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:34,619
expensive as [ __ ] they'll get the job

826
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,599
done oh yeah but you got to buy them

827
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,548
right now to get them there's one brand

828
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,589
that you can't buy it as a consumer you

829
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,759
have to buy it as a commercial girl you

830
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:43,470
have to have a commercial account and

831
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,359
you have to order eight hundred pound of

832
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,589
minimum so you have to have and they

833
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,579
like to sell you a hundred and fifty

834
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,619
pounds because they come in a hundred

835
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:51,689
and fifty pound drum so you got to buy a

836
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,639
hundred and fifty pound drum and have it

837
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,360
delivered and yeah that's the pain in

838
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,490
the ass so it's good stuff though

839
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,709
is what I would go buy for a commercial

840
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,058
girl right now I know so much about it's

841
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,250
why I'm able to get it because I've got

842
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:06,558
150 pound orders for other places if I

843
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,220
just do a commercial any other way than

844
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,940
this okay I've had great success with

845
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,279
their problem

846
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,779
so yeah it's to varying ways of growing

847
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,190
and we're both totally satisfied with

848
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,190
what we're doing and we're both sitting

849
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,360
at a table smoking - yeah yeah you guys

850
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,160
don't have to fight about anything it's

851
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,419
a cannabis industry our point is to grow

852
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,808
the best weed we can it so we can all

853
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:34,250
smoke good we together I grow anyway

854
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:35,720
you know let's see something that we can

855
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,109
touch on that another person asked was

856
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,700
is it labor effective cost-wise yes

857
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,229
that's me I knew that was gonna be your

858
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,569
answers why save that one because I know

859
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:49,099
is gonna be short and quick less

860
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:51,319
man-hours and less we use less water

861
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:52,819
less man-hours and loss waters here

862
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,678
saving a lot of money there through the

863
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:55,789
most expensive things in the grow other

864
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,009
than electricity and you're in a

865
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:01,308
greenhouse so you just cut down all the

866
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:03,140
money nice bro is there anything else

pay a chief consultant to come and [ __ ]

889

I'm yeah that's up to you anyway

895
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:17,058
before we started recording Jesse made a

896
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,130
joke and said remind me to talk about

897
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:20,749
dirty mike and he doesn't mean white

898
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,930
Mike the guy that comes on the podcast

899
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:25,308
he means something about a microphone so

900
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:26,598
he's taking a drink right now but as

901
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:28,009
soon as he's caught up on that I'm gonna

902
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,400
let Jesse talk about his dirty

903
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:34,548
microphone story so back in the day I

904
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,509
played drums in a couple punk rock bands

905
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:40,489
and the best band I ever played for

906
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:44,179
which didn't last very long because I

907
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:49,249
wasn't very good but I sit down at

908
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:54,440
practice and the old drummer had sang

909
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:56,719
and I looked over it as his mic and his

910
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,298
his mic covers like covered with pieces

911
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:02,538
of food eilean [ __ ] just [ __ ] and

912
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:04,969
[ __ ] it was so so disgusting yes

913
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:07,789
horrible but he was like a well-known

914
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:12,078
drummer here in town and yeah it just

915
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:14,989
hit back that is kind of like like you

916
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,298
know like inferiority complex compared

917
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:23,389
to him and I saw that nasty [ __ ] like

918
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:25,309
that he's human too grody [ __ ] that's

919
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,778
so gross yeah unfortunately that's all

920
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,789
too common in the music industry if you

921
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:34,460
buy a pawnshop microphone you got to

922
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:36,049
take the the block the big box store

923
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,460

924
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:38,838

00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:27,568
and make rules you're ahead of the game

972
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:29,518
and you can be an example and when the

973
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:32,849
whatever the control board is if they

974
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:34,798
like you it really helps out if you try

975
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,838
to be if you're the good kid in school

976
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:38,009
the teacher likes you the regulation

977
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,048
boards when it comes to cannabis they

978
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,759
like the same kind of people so hey look

979
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:43,170
we we already preemptively did this

980
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:44,969
before you made the rule like damn you

981
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,889
guys are good they'll don't really enjoy

982
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:48,539
coming to your facility and they'll be a

983
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:49,920
little more lenient when [ __ ] does go

984
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:51,569
wrong because one day something will go

985
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,039
wrong I couldn't say it better myself

986
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:57,808
that's almost my exact speech too yeah

987
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:01,349

988
