focus on growroom pet peeves something

102
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,239
that I see in a grow room whether it's a

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,719
commercial grow whether it's a private

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,158
grow maybe saw I saw it online or

105
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,799

106
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,158

00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,918
to my buddy patio toker I've seen you on

119
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,360

123
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,159
says my pet peeve is undefoliated plants

124
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,759
we're talking plants that have never

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,120
been touched okay that is a very valid

126
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,919
pet peeve and what he means is uh

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,600
defoliation is when you go in and take

128
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,758
off some of the larger leaves I

129
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,400
recommend it I suggest it I almost

130
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,400
demand it be done in commercial grow

131
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,519
environment when there's a lot of

132
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,599
foliage a lot of uh Leaf happening in

133
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,359
the room I find that that that taking

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,800
off those leaves can mitigate a lot of

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,000
problems but patio toker's big pet peeve

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,160
is that he does not like plants that

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,759
have not been

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
defoliated that big 70s Bush of a plant

139
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,120
with all those leaves growing in there

140
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,199
simply drives you crazy I can understand

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,879
that however let me tell you a little

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,960
bit of a story I recently ran a grow

143
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,959
room and in that grow I was struggling

144
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,279
to keep the humidity up I was not going

145
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,239
to buy a humidifier for one grow it was

146
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,198
a short grow process at a weird part of

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,400
the year I had switched equipment I had

148
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,439
switched the way that I was running my

149
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,038
ducting I was struggling to keep the

150
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,000
humidity right in this grow space my

151
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,159
smart idea was to defoliate less than I

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,560
usually do I left the leaves on those

153
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,919
plants to allow them to transpire and

154
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,879
put uh moisture into the air the all of

155
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,599
those leaves were releasing more

156
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,639
moisture into my environment and

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
contributing to the humidity because I

158
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,120
actually needed that in that grow space

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,399
so most of the time you are correct All

160
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,519
of That 70s Bush all that extra foliage

161
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,279
all those leaves are good opportunities

162
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,399
for powdery mildew it's a good place for

163
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,359
bugs to hide it blocks uh light from

164
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,079
your bud s sites there is great reason

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,038
to defoliate but in this situation my

166
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,240
room is getting so dry that I just chose

167
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,038
to leave a bunch of leaves on the plant

168
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,879
and honestly it brought it up just a few

169
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,839
percent just to keep that room where I

170
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,120
needed it I could water heavily the

171
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,079
water in the plants would raise the

172
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,199
humidity just a little bit then all of

173
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,240
that evaporation from the plants helped

174
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,439
but then also all those leaves letting

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,759
out all that water from the stoma that

176
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,560
definitely helped me uh increase the

177
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,840
humidity in the grow space so I do

178
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,439
understand that a lot of times that

179
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,038
could be um not visually appealing it's

180
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,879
probably not best for the growth of the

181
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,120
room in most environments in most

182
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,800
occasions however this one time in my

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,079
grow space I tried a trick and it did

184
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,240
exactly what I needed done so sometimes

185
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,038
these pet peeves are going to be

186
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,240
subjective sometimes we got to think

187
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,639
about um and this this goes for the

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,038
internet and advice on the internet as a

189
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,160
whole if you see advice if you see some

190
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,038
guidance that may work in a certain

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
situation in a certain environment in a

192
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,000
certain room but we don't always know

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
what all the situations in somebody's

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,959
grow space may be I was struggling to

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,639
keep my humidity up because I had

196
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,799
readjusted my ducting I'd made some

197
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,199
changes and I was not going to buy a

198
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,478
humidifier simply for it was about 40

199
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,400
days worth of growth that I would have

200
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,959
needed that humidifier wasn't going to

201
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,719
spend the money on it maybe I'm a cheap

202
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,478
ass Maybe I'm efficient maybe I'm e

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,800
economical but my idea did work what I'm

204
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,719
getting at is uh there's more than one

205
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,240
way to skin a cat and sometimes the

206
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,840
things that we see in a grow that look

207
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,918
like a problem are actually a solution

208
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,758
so we've got to be open-minded uh you've

209
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,560
got to be kind of a mcgyver and a grow

210
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,598
space you've got to be able to adjust

211
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,879
and adapt and you've got to be very

212
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,360
open-minded I think I said that but if I

213
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,319
would have been super stubborn and said

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,800
no I have to defoliate cuz that's the

215
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,199
way I operate that's my sop I actually

216
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,319
would have [ __ ] up that crop I think

217
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,478
it did much better because I left a

218
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:08,360
bunch of leaf on those plants so my dude

219
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,680
patio toker uh 75 or 85% of the time I

220
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,840
do agree with you defoliate those damn

221
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,360
plants but occasionally like in my

222
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,359
instance those leaves contributed to a

223
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,400
little extra humidity and allowed me to

224
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,840
increase the humidity the overall VPD in

225
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,439
the room was improved because of that

226
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,918
extra 70s Bush my dude I'm still going

227
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,158
to send you a free pack of seeds even

228
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,359
though I don't 100% agree with you this

229
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,120
was a great peeve um I like that it's

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
subjective and I like being able to talk

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
about things that we slightly disagree

232
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,598
on although we do agree 85% of the time

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,720
the question and answer portion of

239
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,000
today's podcast I have a website that

240

website is called iy genetics.com it is

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,278
i i e genetics.com iy it's a Patwa or a

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,078
Jamaican word uh iie means to feel the

246
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,399
sitting um maybe on the beach um

247

probably at the beach just a little bit

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,639
of sun coming down on you you're looking

249
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,360
out at the ocean you're watching the

250
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,919
waves crash there's a little bit of

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,519
Breeze moving your hair but it's not

252
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,399
uncomfortable it's just nice a nice

253

your child with you maybe you're all by

258

300
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,919
tour one day on YouTube if possible you

301
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,200
know I really enjoy showing you guys my

302
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,078
garden and my plants and my setups and

303
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,680
things but I'm sure you've noticed or

304
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,519
maybe you haven't I have definitely

305
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,239
noticed and YouTube notices every time I

306
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,399
show a ganja plant in one of my videos

307
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,360
YouTube takes down my video so I'm

308
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,879
allowed to show you my face um my shirt

309
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,639
and this [ __ ] curtain behind me but

310
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,559
that's about all you get because if I

311
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,839
put Plants up on the screen YouTube

312
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,359
takes my video down immediately and then

313
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,200
they send me a community guidelines

314
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,839
strike and if I get too many of those

315
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,639
they take away the channel so

316
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,760
unfortunately I am not comfortable

317
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,600
showing uh my grow spaces or plants on

318
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,278
this channel I did a very good topping

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,159
video about topping our plants I put a

320
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,759
plant on the table and showed you where

321
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,039
to top it and YouTube took that down it

322
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,639
got a couple thousand views and then

323
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,039
YouTube took it down also I took that

324
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,360
top and showed you how to make a clone

325
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,799
out of it in another video YouTube took

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,159
that one down also those are the two

327
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,278
videos I've attempted to bring plants

328
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,439
into the studio and do Hands-On work

329
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,919
with them and then YouTube took it down

330
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,560
so unfortunately I'm not comfortable

331
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,000
doing a tour um that'd be super cool it'

332
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,879
be really fun maybe a patreon only bonus

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
or something but right now it's not

334
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,720
anything that I've got lined up but it's

335
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,560
a good idea now that I just said it hey

336
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Rost to Jeff when you're editing this

337
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,799
write down the idea of doing a patreon

338
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,040
only growroom Tour episode don't edit

339
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,799
that part out so that people can hear

340
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,958
about it all right it's says uh that

341
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,639
would be uh a tour would be cool one day

342
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,559
if possible um I doubt it but maybe on

343
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,159
patreon it goes on though it says I'm

344
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,638
looking to start a breed I'm looking to

345
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,519
start breeding my own genetics so that I

346
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,159
can keep strains that are no longer

347
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,078
being produced and sold and make my

348
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,879
crosses of my own all right that's a

349
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,799
really good idea preservation is key

350
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,360
especially with the possibility of the

351
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,039
DEA changing scheduling on our favorite

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,240
plan it may be much harder to acquire

353
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,559
seeds in the future we will talk about

354
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,198
that as time goes on as things change

355
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,479
I've promised to keep you updated on

356
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,078
that it says I've got a few questions on

357
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
the subject you have come to the right

358
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,879
place my friend I do enjoy breeding

359
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,440
questions it says do you keep your male

360
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,838
plants in of different strains in the

361
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
same tent and all of your female plants

362
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,000
in one tent in a separate room or can

363
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,799
you keep them in one bedroom all

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,240
together with no worries of pollen since

365
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,919
they are in veg so I keep my I call them

366
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
Father plants all the boys that I have

367
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,159
selected are fathers all the female

368
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,799
plants I've selected are mother plants

369
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,838
so uh mothers and fathers are all kept

370
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,120
in the same uh space during their mother

371
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,920
and father cycle this is just where I

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,000
keep the plants just to have the

373
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,159
genetics on storage it's my stable my

374
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
preserve if you will I'm able to keep

375
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,000
all of those plants in the same room in

376
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,360
the same space because like you said

377
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,720
they are in veg you will not have any

378
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,759
pollen present until several days end of

379
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,199
flower unless you make a mistake

380
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,000
sometimes your male plants if they get

381
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,078
root bound if they don't get enough

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,679
light if they get underfed uh if they

383
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,078
just start getting pissy in general for

384
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,919
any reason sometimes those plants will

385
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,919
begin to go into flower and start

386
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,000
dumping pollen for no reason but you

387
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,559
should see that way ahead of time so you

388
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,440
can keep your father and mother plants

389
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:19,559
and your veg plants and your clones and

390
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,199
your seedlings for that matter basically

391
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,319
all in the mother room and the father

392
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,559
room and the stable if you will uh keep

393
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
them all in that environment I recommend

394
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:32,638
18 at least 18 hours of light I honestly

395
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,199
do 19 on and five off why do I do that

396
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
because some of the more like I said a

397
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,919
moment ago some of the more sativa

398
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,039
dominant plants uh the more tropical

399
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,838
varietals the haze varietals some of

400
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,240
those will try to flower if you give

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,040
them too much dark time if they're a

402
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,680
little bit root bound if they're getting

403
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,240
underfed if they get overwatered

404
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,239
sometimes those plants just a few things

405
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480
will trigger those boys to try to go

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,720
into flower I cannot have that happen

407
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,759
because once they start going into

408
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,399
flower it's really hard to turn a male

409
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,759
back around once he gets started that he

410
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,799
really wants to go so I will keep those

411
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,000
on 19 hours on and 5 hours off in my

412
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,439
mother area to keep Healthy Growth and

413
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,278
prevent those plants from going into

414
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,279
flower so um you can keep all those

415
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,799
plants in the same room I would adjust

416
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,639
that timer to 19 on five off and then

417
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,719
feed these plants they're going to need

418
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,039
a uh a heavy vegetative diet they

419
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
basically need uh just the grow bottle

420
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,919
uh for the most part if you've got that

421
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
base nutrient the grow a grow B that's

422
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,159
probably what they're going to need they

423
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,959
may need would feed them microbes of

424
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,600
course they may need a few other things

425
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,479
based on how big and how old they are

426
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,600
but keep an eye on them it's real easy

427
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,839
to feed mother plants very easy give

428
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
them a basic vegetative nutrient mix um

429
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,920
I've been talking about that light

430
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,720
spectrum I try to go 19 hours on and

431
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,439
five off sometimes I will reduce the

432
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,240
intensity of the light in my mother area

433
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't need these plants growing super

434
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,680
quickly I don't need them uh getting

435
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,278
really big very quickly I just need them

436
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,159
to simply be healthy and exist so that

437
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,000
when I do need Cuts they are there and

438
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,439
available so I kind of turn the lights

439
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,839
down a little bit on these plants to

440
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,440
slow the growth I've noticed uh if I've

441
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,759
got the plant the lights boosted up all

442
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,959
the way they grow too quickly for me I

443
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,919
have to top them I have to defoliate

444
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,518
them too much I just simply reduce the

445
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:16,679
lights and they grow beautifully they

446
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,720
grow just fine for the way that I need

447
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,239
them now there is another part to this

448
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,600
question it says do you keep males okay

449
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,680
do you keep males of the same strains

450
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,360
and the same tint yes because there is

451
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,439
no pollen at this time as soon as you

452
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,120
start making pollen everything must be

453
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,720
separated which is the next question so

454
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,120
let's move on to that it says can you

455
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,399
still grow a seedless crop in the same

456
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
house when breeding I definitely don't

457
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,278
want to pollinate and Seed my medicine

458
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,920
and okay so we're going to talk about

459
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,600
that first um breeding in a location

460
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,000
where you're also growing and hoping to

461
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,639
have cilia buds this is an art I've uh

462
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,120
figured this art out it took me a while

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
um full disclosure we could talk about

464
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,078
it now because it's not happening but um

465
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,318
I used to have a grow in my office is

466
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,078
right over there where I edit this show

467
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,359
is just a room over on the other side of

468
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,798
that wall um that used to be a grow

469
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,359
space on the other in that office where

470
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,240
you guys all see me hang out on Discord

471
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,759
and [ __ ] that used to be a grow space

472
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,759
with two 5x5 tents and a 3X3 tent in

473
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,558
there I'd put the boy plants in the 3X3

474
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,318
and then use both 5x FES on opposite

475
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,078
schedules one ran 9:00 a.m. to 900 p.m.

476
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,078
and the other one ran 9:00 p.m. to 9

477
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:27,038
a.m. that way I could maximize the

478
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,079
electricity in that room but not have to

479
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,279
do any upgrades to the electrical had

480
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,960
1,000 watt light running at all times

481
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,319
and then I had a little uh 400 light

482
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,400
running for my boy plants and then that

483
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,519
boy he only had to be on certain hour so

484
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,559
he would take a break but every 12 hours

485
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,720
tent a would be on and then every 12

486
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:45,519
hours tent B would be on so I was always

487
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,120
running a thousand watt light in there

488
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,440
but only one at a time running two

489
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,678
flowering Cycles very very efficient in

490
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,759
that room I was breeding a lot of your

491
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,200
favorite strains that I made came from

492
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,319
that room in there when it used to be a

493
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,759
grow space it's not a grow space anymore

494
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,439
I had to uh I had to make some

495
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,079
adjustments you guys I I was trying to

496
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
the numbers got changed here in Colorado

497
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,519
we used to be allowed to grow so many

498
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,200
more plants now we cannot that was a

499
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,400
wasted grow space turned it into an

500
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,480
office but that was a grow space up

501
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,080
there that room had pollen in it all the

502
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
freaking time I have another grow space

503
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,158
is was in the basement it was directly

504
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,400
below that room there's another room

505
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,480
basically a mirror of that office in the

506
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,080
basement of the house that were in and

507
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,960
that was where my main grow space was I

508
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,439
was able to breed plants upstairs in the

509
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,679
two tents and not contaminate and Seed

510
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,558
the grow that I had downstairs and it

511
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,880
was it took a few tricks to figure it

512
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,519
out but the main thing that I learned

513
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,600
and here's a golden piece of advice if

514
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,359
you're a breeder if you're thinking

515
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,879
about breeding uh this is going to be

516
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,000
one of those episodes and this is going

517
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,080
to be one of the things you want to

518
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,440
write uh write down or record or take a

519
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,960
note of one thing that I really found

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,159
important that really helped me out

521
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
breeding seeds and growing centy crops

522
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,039
in the same house is timing all it's

523
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,359
about is timing if you've got a plant

524
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,319
upstairs dumping pollen don't have other

525
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,599
plants downstairs in flour have those in

526
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,279
veg as soon as you chop down that male

527
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,639
plant and clean up the pollen put that

528
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,000
other room downstairs and flour you've

529
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
only got pollen around for about 21 days

530
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,159
if you do it properly maybe maybe up to

531
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,759
25 28 days you really don't need pollen

532
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,440
around for that long most of your plants

533
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,158
are going to get hit by pollen by day 30

534
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,840
so what I would recommend have your

535
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,640
breeding room get your breeding room

536
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,359
going put those plants don't have

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,480
another room in flower so let me back up

538
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,158
a step

539
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,679
um Harvest your cilia room the room you

540
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,880
don't want seeds in Harvest it uh right

541
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,280
before you harvest that you need to have

542
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,120
another room in flower that you want to

543
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,319
breed or in veg that you want to breed

544
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,918
in so Harvest your seedless crop while

545
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:45,599
you've got another room vegging that you

546
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,360
plan to breed in as soon as you harvest

547
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,158
flip that other crop to flour um in

548
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,759
about 14 days you'll start seeing the

549
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,480
boys uh about 21 days you'll Chuck

550
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,798
pollen by day 25 28 pollen has been

551
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,440
chucked cut down that male plant you

552
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,400
should have another room in veg

553
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
downstairs already that is ready to

554
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,038
Flower by the time that crop gets about

555
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,919
30 45 days in then flip the other room

556
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,158
as long as these plants downstairs are

557
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,038
not in flower if they're in veg they

558
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,760
cannot receive pollen so you have no

559
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,558
stress no worries no fear uh no risk of

560
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,359
pollinating that crop as long as it

561
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:22,678
stays in veg so you can't have both of

562
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:25,000
them in flour at the same time but it's

563
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,400
just a very short uh juggle there so I

564
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,640
would do a flower crop with no seeds in

565
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
one room and then a seed crop in one

566
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,880
room right after that and then back to

567
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,600
back we do flower seed flower seed and

568
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,200
as long as you clean up properly between

569
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,678
runs you won't have any contamination so

570
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,960
it's all about setting the Rhythm have

571
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,960
this room in the one you want a seed

572
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,600
have it in veg while your flower room is

573
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,120
growing Harvest your flowers put your

574
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,599
breeding crop into flow immediately cut

575
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,158
more clones for your other flowering

576
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,399
room and get that filled up and have it

577
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,919
in veg pollinate the breeding room clean

578
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,519
up by clean up I mean cut down down that

579
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,480
boy plant sweep up all the pollen then

580
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,000
spray everything with water water

581
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,679
deactivates pollen so get a I use a pump

582
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,079
sprayer it's a deck spray it holds two

583
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,919
gallons of water um I'll just fill that

584
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,839
bad [ __ ] up with water I actually may

585
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,799
put push in there uh from uh hydroponic

586
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,359
research it's a veg Bloom product it's

587
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,720
called push it's a foler application

588
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,759
it's a great product put that push in

589
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,640
there shake that up spray every single

590
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,400
plant also spray the walls spray

591
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,320
everything down just to kill any pollen

592
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,440
that may be in that room I'll do that a

593
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,439
couple of times I'll go in there and

594
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,480
spray water a couple of times just to

595
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,558
make sure I've deactivated all of that

596
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,400
pollen now once I'm confident that all

597
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
of the pollen is cleaned up put that

598
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,919
other room into flour now those seeds

599
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,798
will finish while your other room is

600
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,679
starting to flow you can Harvest your

601
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,879
seeds and then your other centy crop

602
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,400
will finish and it will be seedless if

603
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,240
you do it properly and time it properly

604
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,360
it's all about timing that is how I make

605
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
it happen that's how I made this house

606
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,599
produced a lot of flowers and a lot of

607
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,759
seeds at the same time unfortunately

608
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,519
since the new stupid rules in Colorado I

609
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,200
can't do that I've got to either make

610
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,038
seeds at one time or run a regular crop

611
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,840
at one time or use other houses and

612
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,440
Facilities which seems to be the trick

613
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,439
but um very limited here so we're not

614
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,120
doing all that multiple room [ __ ]

615
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,278
anymore it's all about that Rhythm just

616
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,158
don't have your centi crop in flour

617
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,159
while you've got pollen in the air and

618
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,080
everything should work beautifully now

619
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,120
if you do insist on having that male

620
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:27,639
plant in flower while you've got a crop

621
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,759
in another room like I said before water

622
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,480
deactivates try to keep everything as

623
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,558
far apart as possible try to have so one

624
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,679
thing I recommend is if you can set it

625
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,720
up with your ducting wherever the maale

626
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,440
plants are kept have that or where your

627
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
pollination room is have that

628
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,840
ventilation go out of your grow facility

629
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,759
If You Can duct that outside uh you may

630
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,079
end up pollinating the outdoor people's

631
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,558
grow if you're not careful but try to I

632
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,599
use a carbon filter so I'm thinking most

633
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,158
of my shit's getting caught in the

634
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,319
filter but try to duck that pollen out

635
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,440
so that you don't accidentally

636
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,240
contaminate the other rooms inside your

637
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,400
growth facility

638
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,400
um water deactivates everything uh if

639
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
you leave that pollen room try to I've

640
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,120
got dreadlocks dude so there's pollen in

641
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,720
my dreads I'm sure of it but try to wrap

642
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,519
your dreads up in a hat try to wear a

643
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,360
hat if you can change clothes if you can

644
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,158
take a shower I recommend that before

645
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,000
going from room to room but water will

646
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,559
deactivate that pollen if you need to go

647
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,880
from room to room I would say go spray

648
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,918
the centy room with water then go do

649
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,520
your stuff in the pollen room then carry

650
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,640
that water with you and when you go back

651
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,759
into the other room spray it again spray

652
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,120
yourself uh water will be your best

653
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,599
friend in that situation so I think

654
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,479
that's the best I can answer you for

655
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,959
that one I told you how I did it it's

656
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,319
all about that Rhythm don't have uh the

657
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,600
seedless cro in flow when there's pollen

658
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,480
and only have the pollen plants or the

659
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,839
pollinated plants in flour when you're

660
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,319
ready to pollinate them it seems to be

661
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:53,000
the easiest way to do it um there's more

662
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,798
though it says um can you use multiple

663
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,960
males at once in the same house I would

664
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,240
not do that um do not use multiple males

665
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,480
just separ separate your breeding

666
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,880
projects just time them out properly it

667
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,038
doesn't take as much time as you're

668
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,679
thinking it does to breed seeds um you

669
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,480
can Chuck pollen and get that mail out

670
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,919
of there in 30 days then you just need

671
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,599
to let those seeds finish up um get the

672
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,080
next mail and the next crop going in

673
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,038
another room and move them up there as

674
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,278
soon as you harvest and that would work

675
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,038
beautifully but I do not recommend two

676
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,679
males at the same time you're going to

677
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,798
have a Mori poage situation that pollen

678
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,000
is going to cross and get on different

679
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,798
plants it's not going to work the way

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,359
that you want it to who knows who the

681
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,558
baby daddy is at that point it turns

682
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,678
into a spring break situation what

683
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,599
precautions would you take to make sure

684
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,720
you don't transfer pollen between tents

685
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,319
water water water water and proper

686
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,919
ventilation is the answer is a different

687
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,798
bedroom needed entirely um I would do it

688
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,600
in a completely different bedroom I

689
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,798
honestly did it in completely different

690
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,038
sections of the house upstairs and

691
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,319
downstairs put a nice barrier between

692
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,960
there um they were actually the like I

693
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,639
said before the rooms were directly on

694
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,038
top of and Below each other and the

695
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,799
stairs are at the opposite end of the

696
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,359
house so I had to go all the way from

697
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,319
one end to the other then all the way

698
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,278
back down to the other so for Polland to

699
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,960
travel with me there it was possible but

700
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,599
it was much more unlikely because it was

701
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,679
such a distance um is a different

702
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,038
bedroom needed yes I would say so and

703
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,559
showering and changing clothes that is

704
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,359
obvious I think you should definitely do

705
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:19,798
that to not move that pollen around but

706
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,359
like I'm saying like the main thing to

707
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,278
make this work here is just don't have

708
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,199
plants you don't want seeded in flour

709
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,880
when there's pollen because the pistols

710
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,759
are what receive pollen um also Al too

711
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
late into flower the plants won't

712
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,359
receive pollen either once the pistols

713
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,359
are all withered up and dry and brown

714
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,879
those plants are past their estris past

715
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,278
their sexual reproductive stage uh they

716
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,840
cannot receive pollen at that point so

717
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,359
uh you could throw pollen at that point

718
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,119
also and not have to worry about those

719
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,319
plants let me make sure I got it the end

720
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,398
of it says also what happened to Jack

721
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,759
the Ripper uh nothing happened to Jack

722
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,879
the Ripper I've still got a good Jack

723
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:57,359
the Ripper male I've got two Jack the

724
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,520
Ripper females uh they're just taking a

725
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,079
little break I've been honestly regular

726
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,759
seeds do not sell making reg seeds right

727
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,199
now doesn't seem to be a very wise move

728
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,599
for the market for the business because

729
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,600
um 90% of my seed sales are feminized

730
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,558
seeds so making the Jack the Ripper

731
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,158
seeds again or more crosses of that

732
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,398
they'll probably most likely sit there

733
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,600
on the Shelf which is why uh reg seeds

734
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:22,879
are on sale on iir right now for1 or $20

735
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,439
a pack you can get a 10 pack of seeds

736
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
for $10 at iir go take advantage of that

737
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
sale I'm trying to breathe life into the

738
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,000
regular Seed Market Market let people

739
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,000
know that Reg seeds are awesome are

740
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,119
popular are viable they should not be

741
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
afraid which is really funny because 10

742
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,678
years ago we had to do the same thing

743
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,200
with fem seeds everybody thought fem

744
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,278
were problematic they were afraid of

745
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,120
them we educated the masses and now

746
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,000
that's all that sells people forgot

747
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,678
about the regs but Jack the Ripper is

748
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,240
still around uh ripping jacking uh

749
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,399
chilling it's in the grow space I've got

750
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,399
a mom I've Got Two Moms I got a dude in

751
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:55,678
there uh they may do work in the future

752
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,038
but right now they're taking a break and

753
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,919
I'm focused on the feminized seeds I've

754
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,960
got a couple of great fem projects

755
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,960
coming up um I'm going to make more

756
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,798
Golden Goat crosses there will be

757
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,440
grateful dog crosses but I've got a new

758
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,639
plant that is gorgeous I haven't talked

759
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,519
too much about it it needs to be bred

760
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,799
with so that is going to be a project in

761
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,119
the near future I'm saying too much

762
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,000
already let's move on this one says I

763
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,398
really appreciate the advice this will

764

766
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,879
question I love talking about breeding I

767
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,960
love talking about pollen so this was a

768
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,440
great question for both of us my dude

769
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,200

772
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,960
not sure how long we've been going but

773
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,278
we're going to jump into one more

774
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,679
message anyway this one is going to be a

775
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:48,079
fun one this one also came from the

776
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,360
growel tab on iry genetics.com this one

777
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,879
came from somebody who wants to be

778
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,199
called Tilly the question is do you

779
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,440
think it's worth it to try popping bag

780
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,640
seeds and hope to cross each other and

781
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,720
make new genetics all right that's a

782
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,600
really good question that's a multi-part

783
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,278
question there you were kind of putting

784
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,359
the cart before the horse with this

785
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:09,159
breeding part but um bag seed what is a

786
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,439
bag seed let's talk about that briefly

787
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:14,919
what is a bag seed bag seed is any seed

788
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,320
that came from your bag of weed let's

789
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,000
say you got a bag of purple Skittle

790
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,798
dicks right because purple Skittle dicks

791
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,519
is going to be the new popular strain

792
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,519
you got this big bag of purple Skittle

793
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,839
dicks right you find seeds in there

794
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,599
those are bag seed many people are going

795
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,839
to say I've got purple SK Skittle dick

796
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,079
seed but guess what you don't because

797
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,759
who knows what that seed came from we

798
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,240
know that the female portion of that

799
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:39,679
plant was purple Skittle dicks who was

800
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,640
the pollen donor who the baby daddy this

801
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,919
is a Mory Povich situation um we don't

802
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,038
know if that plant was self-pollinated

803
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,840
we don't know if that plant was

804
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,480
pollinated by an intersex plant we don't

805
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,798
know if it was pollinated by a regular

806
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,880
plant we don't know who the baby daddy

807
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,278
was so that is simply labeled bag seed

808
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,880
it came from a bag now are those is

809
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:03,519
worth growing the answer to that is [ __ ]

810
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,399
yeah dude grow that bag seed um that

811
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,640
could be the most amazing plant on the

812
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:12,000
planet or also it could be pure garbage

813
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,399
some of the most popular strains on the

814
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,079
planet came from bag seed um maybe

815
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,398
you've heard of a little cross called

816
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:23,839
chem dog there's chm91 chem D um there's

817
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,518
chem OG there's uh there's more that I

818
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,240
can't [ __ ] think of off the top of my

819
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,480
head but the chem dog lineage all of the

820
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,480
dog lines came from bag seed a guy

821
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,759
bought a bag of weed there were 13 seeds

822
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,960
in it he grew some of those from there

823
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,440
came that chem 91 the chem sister the

824
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,679
chem D all of the major famous chem

825
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,320
varietals came from bag seed so you may

826
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,360
have the next amazing line also Girl

827
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,119
Scout cookies is believed to have come

828
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,278
from a cherry pie bag seed it was a bag

829
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,599
of cherry pie with the seed in there um

830
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,519
I'm going to throw out my theory I think

831
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,839
it was a men py citral Kush that

832
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,919
pollinated that cherry pie just from

833
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,439
some stories that I've heard and that is

834
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,960
what made the Girl Scout cookies we will

835
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,440
never know but technically Girl Scout

836
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,679
cookies from what we know was bag seed

837
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,558
also Gorilla Glue and Golden Goat were

838
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,320
accidents which are technically bag seed

839
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,319
they weren't meant to happen it was an

840
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,000
accidental breeding project somebody's

841
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,960
pollen Got Away in their grow room they

842
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,558
found seeds in their weed those two

843
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,440
strains are two of the most popular

844
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,759
strains on the market so I would

845
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
definitely grow out those bag seed do

846
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,079
not sell them trade them or give them

847
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,240
away and if you do give them to anybody

848
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,240
make sure that grower knows that what

849
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,960
they've got is not a reputable tested

850
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,759
seed they have got bag seeds um you

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,440
could produce interex plants you could

852
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,119
produce crazy [ __ ] mutants we don't

853
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,278
know what's going to come from that so

854
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,518
be very open if you give that to anybody

855
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,159
I recommend you grow it you may have

856
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,000
like I keep saying you may have the next

857
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,799
Girl Scout cookies you could have the

858
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,398
next Mac one on your hands who knows

859
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:55,079
what you've got in there now until

860
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,879
you've grown this plant several times

861
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,678
you've beat the [ __ ] out of it you've

862
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,120
stress tested it maybe you've let a

863
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,440
couple of friends grow it in different

864
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,599
environments I would not breed with this

865
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,798
plant until you have fully investigated

866
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,199
this plant's potential is it interex um

867
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,398
if it shows any interex traits do not

868
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,919
breed with it if it shows you mutations

869
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,638
or problems do not breed with it the

870
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,720
entire point of breeding is to improve

871
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,240
this plant the entire point of breeding

872
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,000
is to make plant a and plant B and put

873
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,798
them together and make a plant that is

874
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,599
better than both of those plants if that

875
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,960
is not possible if that is not the

876
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,319
outcome come abandon that project don't

877
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,480
put a a crappy hermaphroditic plant into

878
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,599
a breeding project that is not setting

879
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,839
yourself up for Success that is setting

880
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,158
yourself up for failure and not doing a

881
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:42,839
service to the community or our plants

882
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,360
so let me get back to the notes and get

883
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,000
myself back on track um is it worth

884
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,359
trying to pop bag seeds the answer is

885
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,798
[ __ ] yeah dude pop those grow them get a

886
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,678
clone who knows what you've got but in

887
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:56,359
hopes to cross each other and make new

888
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,240
genetics um I wouldn't breed to anything

889
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,000
unless I have thoroughly stressed tested

890
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,440
it grown it several times identified its

891
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,038
weaknesses its pros its cons find out

892
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,200
what pisses it off find out what makes

893
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,798
it happy most importantly find out if

894
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,798
there are any interex traits and then

895
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,079
most importantly is there a reason to

896
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:14,879
breed with these plants are you just

897
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,519
breeding them because you've got them I

898
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,039
got a boy I got a girl they going to

899
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,200
[ __ ] or do you see traits in this plant

900
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:24,158
is there a reason is there structure

901
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,159
Vigor flavor Aroma color Leaf shape

902
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,880

resistance um are there prosen cons to

906
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,119
these plants are there reasons to make

907
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,719
this plant worth breeding or are you

908
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,319
just making them [ __ ] because you got

909
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,639
them that's what I want to know all

910
