I want to tell a quick story about why I

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,069
really why I really respect and enjoy

88
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,099
the company of mr. Adam hand the the

89
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,500
founder the proprietor the the main dude

90
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,030
there of handmade apparel just a quick

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,969
little rant on why I respect this dude

92
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,520
so much I was in the Denver cannabis cup

93
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,379
one time in Denver of course right and

94
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,390
it was at a place called the X nu Event

95
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,009
Center and the place was too tiny for

96
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,349
how many people were in the facility I

97
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:57,389
was frustrated it took me too long to

98
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,189
park it took me way too long to get in

99
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,539
the facility when they searched my

100
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,020
backpack they took some [ __ ] away from

101
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,519
me

102
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,960
they made me give some things away that

103
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,280
I plan on taking in but they wouldn't

104
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,590
let me take it in I wasn't gonna wait in

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,539
line again that kind of frustrated me

106
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,469
then when I got in there the place was

107
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,629
so crowded

108
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,310
then I literally got stuck in an

109
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,990
intersection of people for several

110
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,699
minutes and could not go left I could

111
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,439
not go right I could not go forward and

112
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,779
I could not go backward I was trapped

113
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,310
and I do not like being trapped so it

114
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,250
put me in a little bit of a shitty mood

115
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,199
to tell you the truth and I get out of

116
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,540
that big [ __ ] of people and the

117
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,579
first booth I come upon with familiar

118
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,830
faces was the handmade apparel and oil

119
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,899
slick booth and I looked at Adam hand

120
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:38,490
from handmade apparel and the first

121
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,949
thing that flew out of my face was boy

122
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,269
this is a [ __ ] isn't it and I

123
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,680
know now that was the wrong thing to say

124
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:45,659
that was the wrong mindset and I know

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,670
that because Adam had looked at me and

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,140
he said brother I came all the way from

127
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,550
Washington for this and look at all

128
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,529
these people that are here having a good

129
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,300
time this is amazing

130
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:56,579
and it took me about a half a second to

131
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,500
snap out of my shitty mood and the

132
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,029
students right I may have had a shitty

133
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,560
parking experience they may have taken

134
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,839
away some cans of butane out of my

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,399
backpack I may have taken ten minutes to

136
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,779
stand in an intersection with a bunch of

137
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,879
high people doing nothing trying to

138
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,429
figure out which way to go but he's

139
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,170
right this is an amazing cannabis themed

140
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,240
event and people from all over the world

141
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,970
were there smoking weed with me and my

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,439
friends so I just needed that quick snap

143
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,780
from Adam head and he gave it to me

144
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,160
politely and kindly and respectfully and

145
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,419
he's really kind and he's super polite

146
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,370
so I feel like I've been going on about

147

00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:09,959
because you know it's getting worn it's

168
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,848
got some fuzz marks like it's coming

169
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,379
frayed the brother printing is solid

170
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,908
still every bit of printing and I on

171
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,639
here is good I hope I'm sure that those

172
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:19,558
hoodies are going to look just as good

173
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,418
for just as long so much love much

174
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,559
respect I appreciate it good job you

175
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,359
guys look forward to doing business with

176
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,860
you in the future I need some t-shirts

177
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,799
soon we need some girl from your heart

178
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,110
podcast t-shirts that's what we need I'm

179
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:33,209
gonna move forward I like to keep the

180
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,528
listeners updated on my breeding project

181
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,569
you guys know that I've got a breeding

182
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:39,598
project underway just a few days ago I

183
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,189
put pollen on those girls you can really

184
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,998
see the seeds bulking up it's only been

185
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,379
a few days

186
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,550
I'm not sure how far apart those

187
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,809
episodes are gonna come out so I'm not

188
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,348
gonna quote how many days but it's been

189
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:51,239
several days a few several days and the

190
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:52,860
seeds were bulking up all the pistols on

191
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:54,418
the plants are really brown and curled

192
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,939
up so you could tell that pollen got in

193
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,318
there I applied so much pollen guys I

194
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,550
kind of got a little bit crazy I put

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,709
more pollen than I should have but I

196
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,499
wanted to make sure to have a [ __ ] ton

197
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,759
of seeds and it is working so let me

198
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,860
give you an update and a reminder of

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,019
what I bred I took in a rise f1 male

200
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,169
that's golden goat the golden go female

201
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,749
was pollinated by a Daybreaker male that

202
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:17,368
made a rise I used that arise male and I

203
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:21,209
have pollinated cookies-and-cream

204
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:24,329
white widow lemon Geoffrey grateful dog

205
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,889
and several other beautiful females

206
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,478
there's a flow plant and there they got

207
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,788
pollinated also and there are some

208
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,738
what's what else is in there there are

209
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:35,548
other arise phenotypes in there so that

210
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:38,278
I can make more of the arise f2 so here

211
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:40,228
in about seven weeks or so those should

212
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:42,209
be done and we'll get to see what

213
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:44,098
cookies-and-cream trust who arise does

214
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,699
and what white widow across to the arize

215
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,139
will do

216
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,959
my goal you guys that cookies-and-cream

217
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,329
plant was one of the most resinous

218
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,519
Frosty's plants I have ever grown and

219
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,529
the taste on it was great those that

220
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,319
plant made some of the best bubble hash

221
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,779
and iced hash I have ever smoked and it

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,849
yielded really heavy on the shatter when

223
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,099
we make shatter you'd get more shatter

224
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,560
than from any other strain but the

225
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,520
problem was if you wanted bud form it

226
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,470
made buds the size of like my thumb tip

227
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,209
just like the top of my thumb they're

228
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,800
just little popcorn balls up the stick

229
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:17,789
all the way up and down the stick just

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,250
little popcorn balls

231
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,510
and they're shooting to trim and it

232
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,459
doesn't put out a lot of weight and the

233
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,589
plants just kind of it just wispy to

234
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,079
grow it's not the best grower so I hit

235
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:31,409
it with the arize pollen because a rise

236
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,809
makes these gigantic huge colas and I'm

237
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,700
hoping that I can get those giant colas

238
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:39,299
with as much resin and as much flavor

239
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,009
and carry that a rise growth trait over

240
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,709
to the cookies and cream now theorize

241
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:46,980
females have been testing in the 29 to

242
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,900
31 percent THC a range so there's a lot

243
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,670
of THC available to put into this cross

244
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,459
I've never had the cookies and cream

245
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,689
crossed in my cross tested myself but

246
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,220
I've seen it test high because it's

247
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,070
available at kind love and several other

248
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,420
dispensaries so I'm hoping I get that

249
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,460
really high THC THC a value on the tests

250
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,990
that are with that cross so look forward

251
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,730
to that I'll post pictures of it when

252
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,200
those seeds are ready I will grow them

253
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,720
and then I'll post pictures of that on

254
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,950
Instagram I am i re underscore genetics

255
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,870
on Instagram if you want to check out

256
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,310
the progress there's also a whole bunch

257
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,779
of good stuff up on there right now also

258
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,779
let you guys on the podcast know how

259
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,029
it's going so that's my breeding update

260
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,309
speaking of updates I read an email on

261
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,179
the last episode from a man who wants to

262
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:32,309
start a cannabis podcast in the UK and

263
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:33,839
since I read that email he has responded

264
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,669
I'm not gonna read the whole email but

265
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll just read a quick portion of it he

266
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,899
says hey dude Ross here messaging off

267
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,000
the podcast email address great show

268
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,009
today some great advice but I must

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,950
apologize though as I wasn't clear I

270
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,559
actually meant mrs. May Theresa May our

271
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,810
new female prime minister seems she's

272
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,039
okay and passionate and here's where I

273
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,269
screwed up you guys and I knew I was

274
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,740
saying something wrong what I said it

275
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:58,319
lost him it felt wrong when I said

276
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,450
but he said MP means members of

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,420
parliament are equivalent to your

278
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,030
Congress and he said I'm sorry if I'm

279
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,649
wrong he said I remember equivalent to

280
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,480
your Congress I think and I'm sorry if

281
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,039
I'm wrong however we do also have a

282
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,470
military police but they're strictly

283
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,230
military nothing political so what I

284
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,050
said excuse for the throat clearing he

285
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,680
wrote a message saying that the Prime

286
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:23,909
Minister was okay was boss I don't

287
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,139
remember what the stance was right now

288
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:28,409
because I'm talking too fast trying to

289
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:31,889
read an email but he said that the MPs

290
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:34,230
were partial were supporting cannabis

291
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,720
and I didn't know what MP stood for and

292
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,490
the American in me took it his military

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,930
police then I was just reading an email

294
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,610
quickly and trying to come up with a

295
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,620
solution quickly and I spat it out

296
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,129
military police I was wrong as [ __ ] you

297
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,200
guys MP and this students meaning stood

298
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,689
for members of parliament so I was wrong

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,710
I apologize for that I hope I didn't

300
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,060
embarrass your country hoping to

301
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,530
embarrass myself too much by saying that

302
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,149
I wasn't trying to be offensive so I

303
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,220
apologize and thanks for correcting me

304
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,529
I'd like to be corrected you guys I like

305
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,690
to be right if I'm wrong on something

306
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,829
feel free to correct me and he also goes

307
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,810
on to say for you to say you're

308
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,509
confident that I'm the right person from

309
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,789
how I write means a lot as I'm that guy

310
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,259
who thinks he sucks at everything does

311
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,299
not suck at everything you're gonna be a

312
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,100
great podcaster he also goes on to talk

313
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,240
about how he is acquiring equipment and

314
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,060
getting his computer ready for the

315
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,220
podcast I look forward to hearing your

316
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,779
show he says he's going to record a

317
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,149
couple episodes and send them to me so

318
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,519
that I can give him some pointers make

319
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,840
sure that you get a couple good episodes

320
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,659
recorded and then when you launch into

321
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,009
iTunes make sure that you get all of

322
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,299
your friends to listen make sure you

323
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,600
have a Twitter account set up so that

324
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,219
you can tweet those podcasts out maybe

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,960
start a Twitter account now and start

326
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,580
developing relationships with friends on

327
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,920
Twitter so that when you do launch

328
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,960

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,380
mainly what I listen to I'm getting to

371
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,139
the weed section I've been listening to

372
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,549
the spliff podcast I used to listen to

373
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,389
Adam Dunn show I haven't paid attention

374
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:16,909
to that one lately

375
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,230
the dude grows is a great podcast it's

376
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,469
in my feet I don't get a chance to

377
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,120
listen to it Legion of skanks is good

378
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,100
and then down on the bottom of my list

379
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,889
Monday morning podcast with Bill burr

380

384
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,470

385
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:37,819
listened to his podcast but is in my

386
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,500
feet so they lose the podcast I'm

387
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,970
listening to all right let's put the

388
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,429
show back on track a little bit and talk

389
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,200
a little bit about cannabis I want to

390
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,609
read some listener emails because when

391
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,990
the listeners send emails I know that

392
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,909
I'm answering the questions you want to

393
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,440
hear I'm actually getting somebody's

394
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,600
attention and helping somebody out so

395
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
this one comes from a regular listener

396
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,750
and someone that contacts me a lot this

397
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,059
one's from Fast Barry what's up fast

398
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,710
very good to hear from you again this

399
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,259
email goes like this

400
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,330
as always really enjoy the podcast I

401
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,590
have a few quick questions for you and

402
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,360
then he did really list a couple few

403
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,560
questions here we'll see how long these

404
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,000
take and then we might read some more

405
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,689
emails we might do a product review

406
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,240
depends on how much time we have

407
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,819
so the email goes like this have you

408
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,079
always grown using bottled nutrients and

409
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:23,909
why or why not um mostly I use bottled

410
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,958
nutrients I prefer the bottle nutrients

411
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:29,549
it's how I learned I have reached

412
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,128
okay so I guess this is why I've had my

413
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,588
best test results and my best flavor and

414
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,199
some of my favorite crops have come from

415
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:41,009
my trusted source of nutrients that I

416
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,990
have I've used so many brands I have

417
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:45,329
used advanced nutrients I've used psycho

418
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:53,068
I have used Fox farms I've used to roar

419
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:54,899
Aurora Seoul I have used routes I don't

420
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:56,338
remember I may be mixing Aurora and then

421
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,500
Seoul synthetic so those might be two

422
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,910
different things I've used the route

423
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,360
stuff with like the Buddha looking

424
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,969
bottles I have used Dutch master I have

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,550
used I have used I've used dyna-gro or

426
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,399
protec that's dyna-gro I've used so many

427
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:15,599
brands my favorite honestly is botanic

428
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:19,589
air pure blend pro bottles the cocoa

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,230
base grow in blue with a little bit of

430
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,149
liquid karma some cal-mag whatever

431
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,039
there's a whole line of stuff but I

432
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,919
prefer most of the botanic air stuff

433
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,179
from the pure blend Pro line and then I

434
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,469
added a couple other things in there

435
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,929
like just a couple of the things I

436
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,569
probably won't mention too much that's

437
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:37,979
mainly my main mix there's some worm

438
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,240
castings in there and I put in some

439
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,800
stuff to get the roots going a little

440
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,899
bit then I add my own you know a couple

441
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,549
little little proprietary things in

442
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,379
there I also like a product called

443
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:49,828
humble honey if I'm using botanic hair

444
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:52,799
put some honey in there but those things

445
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:54,688
that from the bottles I grew a really

446
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,058
great crop every plant and they're got a

447
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,409
super high test everything tasted

448
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:00,149
amazing and the weight was where I

449
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:01,469
needed it so I feel like I fell in love

450
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,028
with it it was like I hit gold and I

451
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,278
don't really want to change from there a

452
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,990
long time ago I had Shawn come on the

453
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,669
show and he started hyping the organic

454
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,730
as [ __ ] methods he started showing me a

455
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:13,860
whole bunch it was great the product was

456
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,019
really great I had to make too many

457
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,579
trips to too many different stores to

458
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,409
make that happen for myself for my

459
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:21,269
lifestyle it wasn't working I was

460
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,828
working a full-time job I was running a

461
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,120
hundred and something like grow by

462
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,879
myself and

463
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,730
have time to hit the worm casting store

464
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,588
the feed store the hydro store and then

465
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,060
go to big R to get tubs to mix all this

466
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,100
[ __ ] in it was getting a little

467
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,289
overwhelming for me if you've got time

468
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,909
to do it and you can do that go for it

469
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,709
but I was running a bottle drop and an

470
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:43,350
organic crop and it was kind of getting

471
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,150
to be a little bit tedious and I live in

472
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,700
a house and I'm not the only one that

473
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,528
lives here I'm trying to do some of

474
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,220
these stinky [ __ ] bothered some of the

475
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:55,230
other people so that wasn't cool if I

476
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,790
lived alone if I had yeah if I was the

477
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,528
only one ever here because sometimes you

478
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:00,719
can when I mix up a tea and I put some

479
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,549
fish emulsion and stuff in there and

480
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,019
some Bokashi and the stuff that comes

481
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:07,409
out of the Kashi bucket the leachate

482
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,869
that lactic acid bacteria it stinks up

483
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,429
the whole house you can't if it's in the

484
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,719
basement in the back left corner you

485
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,370
can't be in the top story of the house

486
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,160
in the top right corner without smelling

487
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,928
it is just rank so that's part of why

488
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,329
it'll do the organics at home I would

489
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,189
love honestly I've been reading about it

490
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:25,588
and thinking about it I would love to

491
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,269
make this shift to no-till organics I

492
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:29,339
would love to be able to set up some

493
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:31,289
compost in the garage put a worm farm in

494
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,779
the garage get that sort of a thing

495
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,879
going and then just use it sounds really

496
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,119
awesome to be able to use the same pots

497
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,340
for every cycle just cut the plant out

498
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,899
shake the roots off put another plant in

499
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:44,308
there put some compost in there some

500
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,910
worm castings in there and get it going

501
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:48,178
again

502
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,590
that sounds amazing so I have not always

503
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,660
drawn with bottled nutrients I've done

504
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:54,419
the organic as [ __ ] method I've done

505
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,940
outdoor stuff that we just did soil we

506
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,670
did a minted soil that's sucked we had

507
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,240
one summer where everything got stolen

508
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,410
I've had one I've had multiple summers

509
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,960
were everything I [ __ ] stolen and

510
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,570
that sucks but all my outdoor stuff was

511
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,808
amended soils and no bottled nutrients

512
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:14,730
at all it's fun I like the I like the

513
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:16,920
bottles I like the mad scientist feeling

514
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,569
of it but I also like the amended soils

515
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,100
and the teas because of the organic

516
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,990
feeling and I'm a dirty hippie

517
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,149
I got dreadlocks and like all that

518
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,429
natural sort of stuff so I have not

519
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,380
always grown with bottles and that is

520
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,340
kind of why and why not so I'm gonna

521
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,860
move on to the next part of your

522
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,859
question do I like well made bubble hash

523
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,750
why or why not

524
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,289
I love some well-made bubble hash I like

525
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:42,740
some fool melt like the Colorado extract

526
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:47,269
company makes this we take so we'll grow

527
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,950
we a commercial grow we'll grow plants

528
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:51,230
and take off the big leaves and then

529
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,490
freeze the buds like cut them off the

530
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,808
sticks and then freeze the buds while

531
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,569
they're still wet so you've got fresh

532
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:57,829
frozen buds and you take them to there

533
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,629
are several companies that do it but

534
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:01,369
Colorado extract company made my

535
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,799
favorite so far you take into these

536
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:05,599
companies and they'd wash it for you and

537
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:07,039
they keep the whole time they do it the

538
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,500
whole time they do the extraction they

539
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,990
keep your product and I think it's 55

540
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,910
degrees or it might be 65 degrees they

541
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,089
keep it the room is that cold your

542
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,759
product is kept on ice the whole time

543
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:21,558
the hash that comes out of there it's

544
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,150
sold to you it's kept in a refrigerator

545
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:24,859
at the dispensary and a lot of people

546
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,870
the hip kids bring a little cooler to

547
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:29,000
buy it because it's old you still cool

548
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:32,769
and the resin heads look like beach sand

549
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,960
in the container that's bubble hash

550
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:37,879
because that's full melt hash and we'll

551
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,410
take that and fold a piece of parchment

552
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,570
paper in half and put it in the middle

553
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,090
and heat up the carb cap just a little

554
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,379
bit and roll a carb cap out on it and it

555
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,509
presses it out and it makes like a

556
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,130
little it looks like a piece of shatter

557
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:50,869
at that point it's just a little thin

558
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,640
layer of hash and you can see through it

559
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,529
and then we take dabs of it like that

560
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,190
when it's pressed out and it just burns

561
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:59,389
so much more smoothly I really you can

562
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,710
tell by the passion to my voice right

563
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,480
now that I'm kind of drooling over a

564
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,730
nice dab of some good solvent less hash

565
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,089
I do love bubble hash if it's done

566
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,470
correctly the problem is there's there

567
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,329
are too many companies not doing it

568
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,960
correctly and it's too overpriced and it

569
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:18,099
has to be stored kept cool what I do

570
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,600
like they take they take some of that

571
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:25,129
hash that really nice 120 or 90 micron

572
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,740
bubble hash and then they press it they

573
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,900
run it through like a rosin press and

574
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,419
the stuff that comes out of that oh that

575
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,030
is delicious you guys it comes out white

576
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:37,130
and it looks like looks like white silly

577
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,779
putty or the stuff that I used to use

578
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,610
when I was in high school and wanted to

579
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,980
put posters on the basement wall but the

580
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:44,808
wall didn't take nails she's this weird

581
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,819
goo tacky stuff it looked like that but

582
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,388
the dabs out of it were so amazing to be

583
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,489
so

584
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:51,498
and I would get really medicated really

585
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:53,598
quickly from it it was like a full-body

586
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:55,219
high when he smoked shatter I don't

587
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:58,458
think he gets to my body as much as I

588
00:20:55,219 --> 00:21:01,659
think the the solvent list does so yes

589
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:04,429
obviously I do like that then you say

590
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:06,769
you talk about your favorite strain to

591
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,538
breed with oh hold on phone just blacked

592
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,358
out you often talk about your favorite

593
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:13,219
strain to breed with breed with of to

594
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:15,798
make hash oil but if you had to pick a

595
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:18,320
desert island ten pack of seeds what

596
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,210
would they be

597
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,689
okay so I think you said that I talked

598
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,100
about a lot of my favorite let's see is

599
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,240
that you kind of stumbled on some words

600
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,939
or talk about your favorite strain to

601
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,029
breed with of to make hash oil but if

602
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,410
you had to pick a desert island baby so

603
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,660
I'm gonna take this is if I had to pick

604
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,519
ten seeds a ten pack of seeds what ten

605
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,180
pack would I pick to be on a desert

606
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,859
island

607
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,509
hopefully it's a deserted island who's

608
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:43,250
on a desert island trying to grow some

609
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,619
cannabis hopefully I've got plenty of

610
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,119
clean water hopefully I can find some

611
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:48,979
stuff to make some organic nutrients

612
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,089
there's gonna be fish around if I'm on

613
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,009
an island right I'll be able to find

614
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:55,339
some fish and make some fish nutrients a

615
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,930
ten pack of seeds that's really a

616
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,189
challenge and see this is gonna

617
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,500
frustrate a lot of people because I've

618
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,720
got a seed vault of my own that nobody

619
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,369
has ever had access to so probably

620
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,170
something like the lemon Jeffrey

621
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:08,929
grateful dog cross is a really good one

622
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,430
I call that lemon sorbet ten packet that

623
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,500
would be really cool if I were stuck on

624
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,630
a deserted island

625
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,319
grateful dog might be the one to pick

626
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,080
dude because it's got the flavor it's

627
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,549
got the aroma it's got that stank but

628
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,289
here's where I'm gonna go weird grateful

629
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,819
dog is feminized seed and I don't want

630
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,009
to be stuck on a deserted island with

631
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:32,869
feminized seeds I want regular seeds so

632
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:35,150
that I could breed so yeah that's such a

633
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,709
tough choice something i've bred

634
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,050
probably you know it'd have to be one of

635
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,670
my creations something regular something

636
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,680
they came from the arize might be cool

637
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,539
you know what dub wise might be a good

638
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,400
one if I were stuck and people like you

639
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,430
never even talked about dub wise it's

640
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,009
easy to grow i produces huge colas and

641
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,840
it's got a couple of good phenotypes

642
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:55,460
there's like a really hazy phenotype and

643
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,500
there's a more indica phenotype but they

644
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,890
all test high in THC so that would be

645
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,920
cool

646
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,630
but so if the grateful dog were regular

647
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,910
seed that would be my pick because then

648
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,490
I could get an OG Kush leaning phenotype

649
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,200
chem 91 leaning phenotype and then I

650
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,579
could get a male and then I could breed

651
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,350
and then I could start doing some [ __ ]

652
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:14,240
and if I had a 10 pack of seeds that's

653
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,819
all I need to make magic happen if you

654
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:22,700
just left me alone on a deserted island

655
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:24,619
we would have in crosses nuts with it so

656
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,590
if the grateful dog were regular seed

657
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:29,029
that would be my first choice the lemon

658
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,009
Geoffrey grateful dog is also a

659
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:32,118
feminized seed so all my favourites are

660
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,339
becoming feminized

661
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:36,528
the Cascade would be cool you know I

662
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:38,839
might have to say arise arise might be

663
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:40,190
the winner because it's available I

664
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,228
could grab a ten pack of that right now

665
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,879
but then I start thinking see I'm just

666
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:46,340
rambling today I kind of want to go away

667
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:49,248
old school and say like why not some old

668
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:50,868
like Brothers Grimm seeds or some mr.

669
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,788
nice seeds from way back in the day

670
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:54,648
because that's when stuff was really

671
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:56,658
neat way back then before we started

672
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:58,819
kind of is breeding for a lot of random

673
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,379
stuff the old breeders seem to have more

674
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,479
goals in mind they seem to have more

675
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:03,769
more foresight for their breeding now it

676
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:05,058
just seems like everybody's breeding for

677
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:06,469
a lot of hype and they're trying to jump

678
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,598
on the skittles train or whatever it

679
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:09,588
seems to be next

680
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:12,019
alright so speaking of skittles that

681
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:14,148
leads me right into the next part of

682
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:17,388
your question fast berry says I live in

683
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:19,728
Rhode Island and can't really walk look

684
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:22,128
hard into getting elite clones if you

685
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:24,819
were me what cutting should I be looking

686
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:27,949
out for well that's a great question um

687
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:29,598
it kind of depends on what you're

688
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,249
looking for honestly if you're looking

689
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,898
for like head stash for yourself you

690
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,579
might want one thing if you're trying to

691
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:36,798
grow some weight you might want another

692
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,329
thing if you need an indica you want one

693
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,179
thing if you need a sativa you want

694
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:42,978
another thing if you are trying to go

695
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,259
for flavor you might want something else

696
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:48,588
right now what I am noticing everything

697
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,389
tangi is popular strawberry banana tan G

698
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:52,788
double banana tan G there's a banana

699
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:55,398
sherbet that goes around there's a

700
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:57,858
banana split all of that like that

701
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:00,408
Crockett family farm stuff is super

702
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:01,788
popular the skittles with a Z I think

703
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,379
they're calling it skittles because they

704
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:05,719
can't call it skittles you know I'm

705
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,478
saying they gotta spell it with Z the

706
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:09,649
skittles is super popular right now

707
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:11,838
everybody's loving the skittles I don't

708
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:14,388
know what's next I wish I could / - one

709
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:15,858
of my strains was the next type but you

710
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,148
can't you can't just make it the next

711
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:18,918
type somebody's got to fall in love with

712
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,358
it it's got to be the next type so

713
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,028
anything with tangi in it people are

714
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:25,128
really in love with tangi right now that

715
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:28,460
strawberry banana Tandy type of stuff is

716
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:30,618
really cool if you want a really heavy

717
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,169
producer straight-up tangi works well

718
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:35,269
for you if you want more of an indica

719
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,349
type of tangi product I would say the

720
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,450
taffy was great

721
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:41,778
so that sort of stuff is what's really

722
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,940
popular right now it's hard to predict

723
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:46,159
because one day it was Girl Scout

724
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,019
jeez for a long time it was OG Kush all

725
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,700
you could sell was OG Kush if you had a

726
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,370
bag of OG Kush and a bag of whatever

727
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,899
else that OG Kush would sell first

728
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,128
you could buy triple the OG Kush of

729
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:58,008
everything else cuz you were gonna sell

730
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:59,480
that OG everyone wanted OG and then it

731
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:03,200
was Girl Scout cookies and then it was

732
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,429
gorilla glue and then it was tangi there

733
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,288
was golden girl for a little while

734
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,110
before that so it's hard to predict

735
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:10,878
what's gonna be the next type strain I

736
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,158
guess I hyped up a whole bunch of that

737
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:15,859
Crockett family farm stuff I could also

738
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,200
say maybe what do you want in your

739
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:20,949
garden you want to rise you want cascade

740
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,019
do you want Firefly you want morning do

741
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,610
you want those are all strains that I

742
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:27,200
have made and I am just trying to push

743
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,569
my products which I mean if you want my

744
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,159
stuff that'd be awesome I think a rise

745
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,240
is a really reliable strain so that's

746
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,710
something you want in your garden

747
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,308
let's see you said you're in Rhode

748
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,079
Island I'm pretty sure I know some

749
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:41,028
activists and cannabis consumers up in

750
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,428
that area and I'm sure that they've got

751
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:44,960
simulate cuts so get in touch with me I

752
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,548
will try to put you in touch with some

753
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,409
people and that way if you need a couple

754
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:50,990
of elites we can put some good stuff in

755
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:52,460
your hands I'm all about clone trading I

756
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,278
don't think people should clone hoard I

757
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,079
think sometimes I will keep some stuff

758
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,388
back because I'm a breeder and I don't

759
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,069
want everything out because I'm going to

760
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:04,729
breed two things and it's kind of my

761
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,439
magic but once I give a clone out I try

762
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,569
not to say hey don't give that out to

763
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,850
people I feel like once I've given a

764
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,710
clone out you that clones going places I

765
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,329
and I know guys that if you tell them

766
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,620
hey don't give this out the first thing

767
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,638
they're gonna do is go oh yeah they're

768
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:17,989
gonna give you the middle finger and

769
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:20,119
they're gonna make as many clones of

770
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,069
that plant as they possibly can so I'm

771
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,619
all about free trade cloning I think

772
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,240
everybody should have a clone exchange

773
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,709
I'm down to trade seeds for clones and

774
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,450
down and trade clones for clones I'm

775
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,590
down to trade clones recedes I like that

776
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,509
kind of stuff I think it should keep

777
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:34,220
moving I think that's how people find

778
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,628
the perfect strain for themselves and

779
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,149
their gardens and or their medical

780
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:39,980
patients I I think clone trading should

781
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:41,599
happen so if I can find somebody in your

782
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,190
area or if you can find somebody in your

783
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,449
area wherever you are whoever you are if

784
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,519
you could find somebody to trade clones

785
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,629
with I highly encourage it just make

786
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,450
sure that when you get home that you

787
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:52,250
treat those clones for pests and you

788
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,690
also quarantine them to keep them away

789
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,880
from the rest of your garden for a few

790
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,009
days so that if there

791
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,100
something wrong you don't go infesting

792
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:02,079
the rest of your garden alright that was

793
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:03,579
long rant I hope I kind of answered your

794
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,319
question on what cuttings you should be

795
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:08,379
looking for any of that Crockett stuff

796
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,970
any IRA genetic stuff also alien rock

797
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,980
candy has been real popular so if

798
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,480
there's alien rock candy available grab

799
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,870
that it's been real popular here in

800
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,579
Colorado lately alright so let's see

801
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,409

803
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:26,890

847
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,690
from your heart what patreon is is a

848
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,789
service that will allow my listeners to

849
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,820
donate financial contributions to the

850
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,200
podcast to help me pay for the web

851
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:04,569
hosting of this show ladies and

852
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,100
gentlemen I read genetics Colorado comm

853
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,379
costs a little over three hundred

854
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:10,149
dollars per year for me to keep up

855
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,290
and that is where all of the podcasts

856
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,470
are host there are a hundred episodes

857
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:16,750
there I am just trying to offset that

858
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,610
financial burden out of my pocket by

859
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,890
asking the listeners to contribute to my

860
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:23,379
patreon account you can contribute as

861
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,790
little as $1 per month and I do not

862
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,500
think there is a limit I think you can

863
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:28,269
put as many zeros on the end of that as

864
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,920
you would like so I would appreciate it

865
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,389
if you would sign up at patreon if you

866
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,220
feel like this podcast is giving you

867
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,050
some value if you've learned something

868
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,759
if you've been entertained one dollar a

869
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:37,930
month is all I ask I'm not begging if

870
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,490
it's something you can do that is

871
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,500
excellent I'm just trying to offset the

872
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,230
cost of my website so that we can keep

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,349
composting he sent me a message and he

978
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,260
said I have had composting on my head

979
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:54,400
all day I don't think compost is quite

980
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,400
what's in your head but it's close

981
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:00,000
here we are we're gonna talk a little

982
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,960
bit about composting yeah where do you

983
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,380
want a smart brother you want to jump

984
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:09,360
right into it with anything okay the

985
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:16,619
first note that I took was Bo Kashi yeah

986
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:19,920
yeah okay so Bo Kashi is for anyone

987
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,980
that's not familiar it is a grain that

988
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,769
has been inoculated with an e/m one

989
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:34,909
culture an endogenous microorganism yes

990
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:38,699
I think they spray like a barley okay

991
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,929
possibly a dairy product that's how you

992
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:43,069
end up with the em1

993
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:45,960
okay fermented milk okay so you take a

994
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:50,130
culture you collect and you mix it with

995
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,809
milk and it uh it ferments and that's

996
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:55,230
how you end up with what they called

997
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:58,039
labs lactic acid bacteria correct okay

998
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:01,320
and from that you can turn that into em1

999
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:05,550
and you can take the e-m1 and oculi your

1000
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:09,380
crane fermented it again let it dry out

1001
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:11,640
and boom you've got boshy great okay so

1002
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:14,130
are you making the Bokashi are you

1003
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:18,269
buying the Bokashi pre-made I'm getting

1004
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:21,230
the Bo Kashi right now from Victor with

1005
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:25,320
innovative organics up in Denver okay

1006
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:28,920
it's really good and it's pretty damn

1007
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:34,380
cheap so and he's a small local business

1008
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:37,950
that is that's taken food out of the

1009
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,440
book you know landfills oh very cool so

1010
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:41,849
it's so let's teach the people about the

1011
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,900
Bokashi bucket a little bit then since

1012
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:44,400
you said taking food out of the

1013
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,559
landfills that's gonna make people have

1014
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,030
a lot of questions I've got a bocce

1015
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,980
bucket I can see one from where we're

1016
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,170
sitting so it'll be advantageous to

1017
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,869
describe it it's basically a five-gallon

1018
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,220
bucket with a spigot on it there's a

1019
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,799
little collection tray in the bottom

1020
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:00,359
that prevents these solid particles from

1021
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,080
getting in the way of the spigot and

1022
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,490
basically I fill that thing with my

1023
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,019
vegetable scraps I don't eat any meat

1024
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:09,389
product so all my vegetables scrap

1025
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,250
the tips of my carrots the ends of my

1026
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:13,319
avocados the avocado pits go in there

1027
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,750
and they disintegrate completely stuff

1028
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,280
food goes to waste anything I would

1029
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,019
throw away it's sitting near the trash

1030
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,550
can to encourage me instead of putting

1031
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,949
in the trash it goes in the Kashi bucket

1032
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,539
I fill it up I fill up a bowl like a

1033
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:26,519
glass bowl and then I dump that glass

1034
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,659
bowl into the Bokashi bucket because

1035
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,009
it's much easier that way and I don't

1036
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,009
have to open it as frequently because

1037
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:37,230
bucket with a lid that seals on it it's

1038
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:39,299
gonna speak it I usually put a little

1039
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,730
late a thin layer of newspaper in there

1040
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,080
just to prevent a good I do yeah some of

1041
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,559
that particle stuff will clog up the

1042
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,000
drain Zangler so you put put the paper

1043
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,529
down and then you I just put like a

1044
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,880
couple banana peels I honestly in there

1045
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,620
to get started so you [ __ ] son of I used

1046
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,730
to eat a [ __ ] ton of bananas too banana

1047
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:56,069
peels in there to get it started than a

1048
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:58,559
handful of the Bokashi grain because

1049
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,850
that is a bio activator and then you

1050
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,320
just start throwing your all your scrap

1051
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,809
in there and then once you get a nice

1052
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,190
layer maybe an inch or two thick then

1053
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:07,349
just put a little another handful of

1054
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,440
that Bokashi grain on there and repeat

1055
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:11,730
just make lasagna basically of scraps

1056
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,260
Kashi scraps Kashi

1057
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,590
I think it's an inch and a half that

1058
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:19,440
they say okay I put in every inch and a

1059
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,030
half throw in more [ __ ] and don't

1060
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,920
press it down you guys cuz it's going to

1061
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:26,310
expand in there no you do want to press

1062
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,430
you do want to press it down yes okay

1063
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:31,889
all right so uh most bowl Kashi buckets

1064
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:33,389
come with a little masher thing oh it's

1065
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:36,179
when you push it down that it farts and

1066
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:38,489
makes that horrific smell yes okay he's

1067
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,509
also you could squeeze a shit-ton oh

1068
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:44,159
[Music]

1069
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,500
yeah have you ever tried to clean a

1070
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,029
dream with that juice I actually just

1071
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,300
tried it the other day Dave's work for

1072
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,930
it no but it's pretty [ __ ] close okay

1073
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:56,680
I poured

1074
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:57,739
I even made sure had enough I poured

1075
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,940
[Music]

1076
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:01,769
like if that's like a hair clog that

1077
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,679
would have done it you got something

1078
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:08,420
serious all right so

1079
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,190
you make your little is Anya then you

1080
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,200
pack it down and then you seal it up and

1081
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,090
just leave it in there and then after

1082
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,250
about ten or twelve days it'll start

1083
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,809
making juice and you can open up the

1084
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,760
little spigot and I use a glass mason

1085
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:21,199
jar to catch the juice and then I seal

1086
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,760
it up and then I cover it with honestly

1087
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,750
with just a rag to keep it dark because

1088
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,830
you want to keep that away from the

1089
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:29,719
light and then I put about an ounce per

1090
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:31,429
five gallon bucket when I go to mix up

1091
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:33,259
some nutrients put about an ounce of

1092
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,699
that crap in there and a five gallon

1093
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,500
bucket with my newts and I can see the

1094
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:39,799
plants start up taking oh yeah much

1095
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,239
better and it's just full of nutrients

1096
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,810
it's all the nutrients from the plant

1097
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:47,389
right I mean it's just that that's all

1098
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:50,210
I'm using now in my girl that's amazing

1099
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:50,809
even at the big grow we started using it

1100
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,690
quite a bit

1101
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:56,239
and it will save on trash yeah save on

1102
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:59,329
nutrient money it's full of humic acids

1103
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:03,229
folic acids lactic acids

1104
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:04,759
it's got bacteria and fungi in it a lot

1105
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,349
of the things that you probably forgot

1106
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,440
about and that your bottled nutrient

1107
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:11,299
company probably missed also speed up

1108
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,950
the root zone speed up the metabolism of

1109
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,450
your plants so this is just the Bokashi

1110
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,250
bucket you can get that lactic acid

1111
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:17,919
bacteria juice out of there so it'll

1112
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:21,199
start growing this white funky foam

1113
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,930
these big gross looking brainy bubbles

1114
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,000
that is perfect you want that if that's

1115
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:28,069
happening you did it perfectly keep that

1116
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,110
going because once you've drained it a

1117
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,280
few times you can drain it a lot of

1118
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,380
times you can leave it going and keep

1119
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,760
draining it mash it drain it and mash it

1120
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,160
it'll go for a long time but eventually

1121
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,770
what I like to do after I've harvested

1122
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:42,889
I'll take my old dirt and pour it into a

1123
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:45,019
big like a big are it's like a feed

1124
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,609
trough for horses I think pour all the

1125
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:49,009
dirt into there then I'll pour that

1126
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:51,289
Bokashi bucket into there all that funk

1127
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,550
and mix it in and mix that in with my

1128
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,679
dirt and cover it and put a little

1129
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,440
moisture in there and finish breads and

1130
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:59,269
I feel like that stuff whatever I made

1131
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,329
in the Kashi bucket grows throughout my

1132
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:03,980
soil just go stir it occasionally and

1133
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:06,860
I'll try to do it I'll try to get to

1134
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,490
full Bokashi buckets in there before I

1135
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:13,000
go start to reuse it yeah

1136
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:15,159
the smell is intense we do it kind of

1137
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,809
smells you're indoors like somebody

1138
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:19,230
threw up in the bar trashcan after

1139
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:25,059
drinking all day

1140
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:27,269
milk ice cream and then drink all day

1141
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:30,670
then threw up in the bar trash can

1142
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:32,650
that's seriously it's bad you can just

1143
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,599
green a little Mike can't be around it

1144
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,740
white Mike it's on the podcast often he

1145
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:37,630
can't he's like oh if you're gonna do

1146
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:45,129
that I'm [ __ ] going off like he won't

1147
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:46,809
even be here the guy's the Bokashi

1148
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,000
people on instagram actually there's

1149
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:52,210
actually a company called Bokashi they

1150
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,679
use 55-gallon drums of the mixture and

1151
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,420
then they use a forklift to lift it up

1152
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,809
and dump it and I could just imagine

1153
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:02,039
what that smells like just 55 gallons of

1154
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:08,799
dead body Victor's doing the same thing

1155
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:10,570
with the innovative organics okay oh

1156
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,820
when you were talking about putting a

1157
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:16,960
lot of banana peels in there so cool

1158
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:18,850
thing about or doing this process is the

1159
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,269
compost that the Bocage you will

1160
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:26,440
eventually make the pulp itself and the

1161
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:28,920
leachate from it are both they contained

1162
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,559
the nutrients that the plants contained

1163
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:36,670
and bananas for instance are super high

1164
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:40,659
in potassium so if you want a custom

1165
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,460
tune no costs Bo Kashi juice I mean you

1166
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:45,269
know look at the nutrients that are in

1167
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,858
the plant if you filled that thing with

1168
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:51,159
with bananas and banana peels like

1169
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:54,279
guaranteed behind guarantee case yep

1170
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:55,960
yeah if you put berries that are darker

1171
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,460
in colors we're gonna have a whole bunch

1172
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,970
of like hue mix and stuff like that in

1173
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,710
there I assume okay so you've got your

1174
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:04,868
book Oishi bucket you got this whole

1175
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:08,139
fuzzy white mess of stuff you've got

1176
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,460
jars of lactic acid bacteria then you

1177
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,980
said your next thing that you got going

1178
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,760
was your worm program let's talk about

1179
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,719
your worms

1180
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:19,730
so I started

1181
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:22,399
100 worms back in the summer a potential

1182
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:27,010
vendor brought them in and just came to

1183
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:30,380
me it was like a nice red wigglers yeah

1184
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,780
wiggler shows 100 of them and like you

1185
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,630
know like occasion yeah exactly

1186
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,269
all right so I took it home and dumped

1187
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:42,019
him in a smart pot full of food scraps

1188
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:44,300
initially I put it just straight peat

1189
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:48,199
moss in there except something they eat

1190
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,200
and I also did I think some newspaper

1191
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:54,199
then and I kept him through the summer

1192
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,419
I wasn't like real actively feeding him

1193
00:47:54,199 --> 00:48:00,889
or anything but now that winters came

1194
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:04,338
around I took I think it's a 40 gallon

1195
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:06,170
container and filled it with all the

1196
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:09,049
worm or you know all this stuff

1197
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:12,730
necessary for a good proper setup of

1198
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:15,740
warm bedding and I've been dumping the

1199
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:18,550
Bocage a bulb in there and they go

1200
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:20,358
[ __ ] nuts for that [ __ ] but I've got

1201
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,310
so I mean I'm just

1202
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:25,279
it's just cool so I'm making all my

1203
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:26,539
nutrients at home basically we we tell

1204
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,230
us a little bit about what's in your

1205
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:33,050
warm bedding yeah so I use I got some

1206
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,460
used phone books as well I think all

1207
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,109
phone books are used I don't even know

1208
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,349
why the [ __ ] they still make it's true

1209
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:44,509
just the waste of trees yeah I shredded

1210
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:48,140
them up and a bunch of newspapers I used

1211
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:50,630
wood chips I have a comfrey plant at

1212
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:53,269
home so that's indoors so I went ahead

1213
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,500
and chopped all of that guys like so

1214
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:56,480
they're gonna turn that up for you

1215
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,929
turned out any useable nutrients which

1216
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,480
that's a whole another part of my little

1217
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:06,858
homestead style kinda like the comfrey

1218
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,460
that is but I put some of that in there

1219
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:11,509
and then a full bucket of bocaj see

1220
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,010
stuff Wow

1221
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,810
they're gonna love all that and I

1222
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,670
figured out it so the bow cause she

1223
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:21,409
stinks like hell when it's tuna

1224
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:24,139
then yes so this time I put a whole

1225
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:26,000
bunch of wood thick layer wood chips on

1226
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:28,219
the top and then a bunch of wet

1227
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,518
newspaper to seal it all on the trap it

1228
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:33,528
in there and the smell was cool okay

1229
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:35,449
that's helpful yeah in the winter like

1230
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:37,309
this it's cold you guys it's probably 12

1231
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:43,848
degrees here in Colorado maybe lower

1232
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:46,010
I'm not a knight it's gonna get stupid

1233
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,940
cold in my garage I'm guessing it's

1234
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,160
gonna be in the teens

1235
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,470
would I be able to keep my 40 gallon

1236
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:53,528
worm life container in the garage right

1237
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:53,528
now

1238
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:59,320
you know I don't really know okay I have

1239
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,789
a similar situation but my car just

1240
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:05,740
heated it's around 65 degrees and they

1241
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:07,539
don't give it like do it almost the

1242
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:09,069
think I would assume that that dirt is

1243
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:11,469
gonna be hot anyway because it's

1244
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,840
bioactive in there yeah that's like the

1245
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:17,019
the little warm farm I have most

1246
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,960
definitely it creates its own heat it's

1247
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:24,300
more established the big one I just set

1248
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:28,720
that up last weekend so I'm sure it will

1249
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:31,180
meeting up I'm not gonna like just say

1250
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,099
oh yeah you'll be fine so okay one thing

1251
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:36,039
I would for sure do this is lift it off

1252
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:37,599
the floor okay so that's not that cold

1253
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:40,449
your plants want to be off that cold

1254
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,940
concrete really sucks for plants unless

1255
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:45,219
it's a real fancy heated floor right

1256
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,280
he gets so cold yes I'm cold so fast

1257
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:54,429
it's a heat sink it actually stills keep

1258
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:57,780
out of things that are like when you're

1259
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,779
drunk anyway in the bathtub to cool down

1260
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:04,449
[Music]

1261
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:05,709
okay all right so you've got your bo

1262
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:08,439
khosh you got your worms and you're

1263
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,670
using a big forty gallon container how

1264
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,400
well what else you is going into your

1265
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,909
compost just kids subscribes at this

1266
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:20,019
point once spring comes around and it's

1267
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:21,819
not cold as [ __ ] when I get my outdoor

1268
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:25,090
compost pile go and I'll be putting all

1269
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:28,660
the chicken bedding in there that's

1270
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:32,350
mixed with chicken [ __ ] okay and you put

1271
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:35,829
like meat products in there also no boat

1272
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:38,079
I mean you can invoke Oishi but there

1273
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:39,639
they say you can I actually saw somebody

1274
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,159
bocaj you people put their entire

1275
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,829
Thanksgiving dinner there turkey like

1276
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,210
the carcass of the uneaten turkey the

1277
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:47,349
mashed potatoes they put the entire

1278
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,358
thing in there then they showed the

1279
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:50,799
process they and then they took a the

1280
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,569
thing outside and dug a hole and buried

1281
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,480
it and then they planted a tree on top

1282
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:56,590
where they buried it so it's claimed

1283
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,380
they could put meat in there as well

1284
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,579
this is longer David say put feces in

1285
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,740
there

1286
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:04,529
things I'm not brave enough to do and

1287
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:08,469
things I'm not gonna do for my endure

1288
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:11,320
right if I had a big huge gigantic

1289
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:13,239
outdoor garden I that would be an

1290
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,200
end-of-the-world scenario oh yeah yeah

1291
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:18,639
yeah what even dairy cheese and stuff

1292
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,799
like that they say you can put egg

1293
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:25,480
shells in there oh yeah I do I totally

1294
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:28,690
put a yeah coffee grounds even paper I

1295
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,630
mean it's like coffee filters newspaper

1296
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:34,690
stuff like okay so yeah just eats that

1297
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:38,220
right up disappears yeah you don't get a

1298
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:42,099
lot of leachate off awesome I've been

1299
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:46,089
putting all my cannabis scraps of him so

1300
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:48,819
I've been when you've run him through if

1301
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:51,160
I was to throw like the leaves and stuff

1302
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,950
off my plants in the garden into the

1303
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:59,529
open warm bin I would lose most of the

1304
00:52:53,949 --> 00:53:03,460
nitrogen and Patel said I would lose

1305
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:05,890
carbon through the co2 that it admits as

1306
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,990
it dries out breaks down okay running

1307
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:10,869
them through the Bo Kashi bucket you

1308
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:13,659
retain all of that Wow okay his permits

1309
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:15,489
at first and it traps it in the plant so

1310
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:18,009
then it's it's healthier food for the

1311
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:19,389
worms and it makes a higher quality

1312
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,280
product richer

1313
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:22,779
yeah much richer okay if that

1314
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,740
fermentation is what gives it that

1315
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,290
amazing smell

1316
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:29,859
yeah it's Victor's been teaching me

1317
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:31,420
about wonders of bo khosh shoutout to

1318
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,480
Victor yeah he knows what he's talking

1319
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,099
about um he we totally get him on the

1320
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:46,750
show when they say the victory round I

1321
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:54,309
have to be on the phone okay warehouse

1322
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:57,400
full of [ __ ] when you're a ganja

1323
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:01,150
grower smells kind of funky sometimes is

1324
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,430
it a sickeningly satisfying thing like

1325
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,440
that smells terrible I'll take 5 gallons

1326
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:08,149
of it

1327
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,079
you know that that's gonna make fish

1328
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,800
hydro slates

1329
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:15,259
and like Bo Kashi juice remember Nirvana

1330
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,060
and piranha or what was it piranha and

1331
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,680
tarantula from advanced nutrients when

1332
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:20,449
they made the liquids yeah oh those

1333
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,859
things smell like the women's bathroom

1334
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:25,099
at the park in the middle of the summer

1335
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,720
it was so terrible they worked you could

1336
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:28,009
feed your plants very little of those

1337
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,609
things and your plants would just go ape

1338
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:33,440
[ __ ] I admit it back in the day I used

1339
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,940
all of the advanced nutrients product I

1340
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,750
didn't know any better that's what I've

1341
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,220
never tried I just yeah not to bash

1342
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:43,489
anything but that's one that I would

1343
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:45,709
avoid they promise you that you'll get

1344
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:47,929
30 percent heavier yields which it did

1345
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,880
it gave me probably 30% fatter yields

1346
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,190
than any other brand I've ever used but

1347
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,190
all of my different strains looked

1348
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:58,909
smelled and tasted the exact same and

1349
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:00,710
they were all about I hypothetically if

1350
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:02,449
all those strains hit 30 percent of THC

1351
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,490
with my regular regimen they all hit

1352
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:07,219
about 20-25 when I used advanced

1353
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:08,809
nutrients but they were heavier a lot

1354
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:11,509
more of it it just wasn't and I'd rather

1355
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:15,009
have I'd rather grow a pound and a half

1356
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:19,010
of super dank than two pounds of me

1357
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:21,140
they are extremely overpriced and I can

1358
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:24,080
tell you that working with them as a

1359
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:26,299
vendor and a company they are [ __ ]

1360
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,889
nightmare every hydro shop that I've

1361
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,539
tried to mess with has said that because

1362
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:31,009
I would be like hey can you order this

1363
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:32,059
new advanced nutrients product and

1364
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:33,950
people just shake their head to me like

1365
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:36,799
no I'll take what they send me they send

1366
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:41,869
me boxes of [ __ ] I sell that stuff oh

1367
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:44,690
yeah cycle right I did a side by I've

1368
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:46,929
done a lot of side by side way side

1369
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:49,490
track I did not prefer psycho either

1370
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:50,779
psycho gave me a lot of great colors it

1371
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:52,639
gave me bud density and they gave me

1372
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,050
weight but I did not approve of the

1373
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,519
flavor the flavor was where it was

1374
00:55:54,050 --> 00:56:00,050
lacking everything tasted like grape

1375
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:03,259
kool-aid that seems to be how all those

1376
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:05,660
multi part lines right if the bottles

1377
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,940
look like clear with different dyes in

1378
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:08,989
them it's all probably in my opinion I

1379
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,220
don't know this for sure I should

1380
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:12,079
research this they probably all come

1381
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:13,219
from one factory and they just get

1382
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,289
poured into different bottles and get

1383
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,500
different names put on them something or

1384
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:19,710
something similar

1385
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,780
I am as a rule of thumb when you're sure

1386
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:23,730
this is just my opinion but as a rule of

1387
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,560
thumb when you're shopping for a

1388
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:28,590
nutrient line try to stick with an

1389
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:31,590
american-made nutrient yeah those are by

1390
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:36,960
far the best quality avoid Dutch

1391
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:38,490
nutrients of Dutch growers grow a

1392
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,920
completely different way than most

1393
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:43,769
Americans and the nutrients are

1394
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,869
formulated differently and they don't

1395
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:48,119
really work well with the way most

1396
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:50,489
American growers grow I agree with most

1397
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,139
of that I have seen some great results

1398
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:54,599
though with a couple of those Dutch

1399
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:58,349
brands might want mils if you follow

1400
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:59,849
them okay okay then I can think of three

1401
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,009
brands that I would almost buy their

1402
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:21,420
products if it came down to I mean House

1403
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:23,520
&amp; Garden is okay you're right though

1404
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,460
about i I've got a note somewhere that

1405
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,860
says to talk about Dutch the Dutch bred

1406
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,780
cannabis to be a [ __ ] because their

1407
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:38,039
grow rooms happens on a rocky mountain

1408
00:57:33,780 --> 00:58:01,650
in Afghanistan where the wind beat the

1409
00:57:38,039 --> 00:58:03,150
Sun on it so then the Dutch the Dutch

1410
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,920
got a hold of these plants like we want

1411
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,300
to grow them indoors I have no idea what

1412
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,740
a [ __ ] Dutch exit would sound like if

1413
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,910
I tried to do it we want to grow these

1414
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:10,409
indoors they wanted to find the best

1415
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:12,480
[ __ ] they bred it to be these really

1416
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:12,869
skinny sticks that grow really perfect

1417
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,059
buds

1418
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:20,309
it's like roses like tulips that's Dutch

1419
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:23,549
is all about the flower industries yeah

1420
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:25,139
exactly and over here in Colorado

1421
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:27,010
California the states that are catching

1422
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:29,079
on we want to grow dank

1423
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:31,119
robust plants we understand about full

1424
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:34,108
plant health we're breeding for complete

1425
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,460
plant structure not just tulips with

1426
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:39,789
[ __ ] must the time I can pick out a

1427
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:44,679
Dutch strain or duck kinetics from dot F

1428
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:47,079
from touch from Amsterdam with I mean

1429
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:50,108
roll a joint and smoke it you know put

1430
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:52,329
two roll three joints put two American

1431
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:54,519
strains and one from Amsterdam in there

1432
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:57,358
and I guarantee I'll be able to pick out

1433
00:58:54,519 --> 00:59:01,269
though the whitewashed

1434
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:03,670
just completely blended everything

1435
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:08,579
tastes berries and flowers yeah nobody

1436
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:08,579
structure okay I don't want to go back

1437
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,880
and you know some American breeders are

1438
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,730
probably susceptible and guilty of it

1439
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,980
also probably bred because we wanted to

1440
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,659
find back in the day we didn't have a

1441
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,059
high pressure sodium lamp or an LED we

1442
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:35,649
probably were using whatever finagled

1443
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:37,779
lamp we can put together in the garage

1444
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:39,579
to make some space to try to create a 12

1445
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,440
12 flower cycle out of the few seeds

1446
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,340
that we did get from whatever we we got

1447
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,769
that we didn't know where it came from

1448
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,690
but some dude told us was tie stick but

1449
00:59:44,769 --> 00:59:47,800
it was probably from Mexico but we

1450
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:52,840
thought it was cool to tell our friends

1451
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:54,730
it was Jamaican maybe tie stick maybe

1452
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,130
Colombian may be Jamaican seeds it could

1453
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,690
be males could be females could be who

1454
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,490
knows what it is and they gotta figure

1455
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:02,260
out how to grow that so we may have

1456
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:03,159
gotten rid of the good [ __ ] back in the

1457
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,359
day because we didn't have the right

1458
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:06,129
whites we didn't have the right

1459
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,719
knowledge we just wanted something that

1460
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,200
finished quick and didn't climb up into

1461
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:10,689
the lights

1462
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:13,118
I grew for three years before I ever saw

1463
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:15,400
a cloned or even made one so you just

1464
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:19,329
did a bunch of seeds yeah I would kill

1465
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,730
to have some uh yes I thought about how

1466
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:23,559
many I used by Mexican schwag weed back

1467
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,659
in the day where I live Mexican ragweed

1468
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:27,340
was 450 500 dollars a pound it was

1469
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:29,049
everywhere and you could get a half

1470
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:31,690
ounce of seeds out of it it looked like

1471
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:33,130
good healthy viable seeds I almost

1472
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,869
wonder what I would have gotten from

1473
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,970
them because you know those Mexican

1474
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,338
crops were producing a low yielding

1475
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:40,618
strain

1476
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:43,048
remember the lime-green Christmas but

1477
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:45,539
yes I grew out some seats how did that

1478
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:47,880
come out it was lime-green Christmas so

1479
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:50,969
it was just I guarantee that was like

1480
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,249
touch genetics here we go yeah some Auto

1481
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:56,519
flowers there's something like that it

1482
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:58,438
was just it was alright wait you know 10

1483
01:00:56,518 --> 01:00:59,818
years ago what'll it [ __ ] head over

1484
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,498
heels for yeah it's funny that you call

1485
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:14,429
it Christmas but cuz this town is known

1486
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:17,399
for getting that's amazing there's a lot

1487
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:19,048
of talk about the Mexican cartels using

1488
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,670
auto flower strains so that they can

1489
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:22,079
keep stuff going year-round and we

1490
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,999
talked about the one crop that was

1491
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,640
busted in the forest near us it was all

1492
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:30,899
Auto flowers yeah yeah that's so yeah

1493
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,879
that's how they do that there those

1494
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,298
girls are cookie cutter there's every

1495
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,999
single one of them's the same I mean

1496
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:42,268
there are different locations but the

1497
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:43,889
way they grow I mean the cops I can tell

1498
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:46,108
by looking at the pictures most the time

1499
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:48,358
even the cops know you know the DEA

1500
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:50,400
there's just a certain like [ __ ]

1501
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,278
Willie and his crew were here again so

1502
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,400
if you're ever going to bust the pickle

1503
01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:59,338
grow that somewhere find out what that

1504
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:07,699
isn't grow just like it's a Mexican food

1505
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:10,018
I think that's what gives him the first

1506
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:11,688
what did they call Mexican nationals

1507
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,558
what they label them as in the paper

1508
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:19,048
like how do you know that we thought

1509
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:22,530
tortillas I used to get mad when I found

1510
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:25,338
seeds of my weed like good money for

1511
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:27,929
[Music]

1512
01:02:25,338 --> 01:02:32,639
what happened through out the window on

1513
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:34,789
Phish tour had those died when I was out

1514
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,708
in California one time the first time I

1515
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:39,900
was exposed to the whole medical

1516
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:42,389
marijuana scene and everything kind of

1517
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,599
changed my life actually I smoked some

1518
01:02:42,389 --> 01:02:48,009
OG Kush out there from my then

1519
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,559
girlfriends

1520
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:53,800
cousin it was full of seats and I

1521
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:57,329
brought him back even and just over move

1522
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:01,240
moving from you know over the years I

1523
01:02:57,329 --> 01:03:03,190
lost them so it's you find them when the

1524
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:05,289
time is right hopefully oh they're long

1525
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:07,059
I just know you guys to talk about my

1526
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:09,340
first experience with medical marijuana

1527
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:10,449
because I just I've got a cool [ __ ]

1528
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,220
story I'm not gonna tell on this but

1529
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:16,509
it's another podcast I just thought

1530
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:20,649
about that I saw 4k room there was a

1531
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:22,750
light down okay now that I'm a more

1532
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:25,108
experienced grower like total Cali style

1533
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,070
[ __ ] flood and drain tables

1534
01:03:25,108 --> 01:03:29,289
everything that's the way to do it but

1535
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:32,200
the fast crank they it just blew my mind

1536
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:34,869
it was like the oh man all these things

1537
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:36,879
I thought about that room then like just

1538
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:40,030
how huge it was and how much money they

1539
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,358
must wake and all that how much work it

1540
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:45,280
was now I kind of chuckle but yeah this

1559
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:38,920
kind of got sidetracked don't ask a

1560
01:04:35,139 --> 01:04:40,809
couple other questions also I just was

1561
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,130
what's your favorite [ __ ] to smoke

1562
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,239
because we're talking about seeds and I

1563
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:44,440
had a strain in mind that I wanted to

1564
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:45,669
ask you about and I was like I wonder if

1565
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,980

was amazing to the indica version I

1573
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:48,048
could be completely wrong by the

1574
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:50,419
Northern Lights I know it's bull rider

1575

01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:56,630
actually put that one out in seed form

1578
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:58,039
in the beginning and then now there's

1579

1613
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:31,680
part of my plan with this big warm

1614
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:36,568
container is to release in my garden in

1615
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:38,998
the spring early summer so that I'm just

1616
01:07:36,568 --> 01:07:41,009
I'm building up the soil in my garden

1617
01:07:38,998 --> 01:07:43,439
year after year after year yeah if I can

1618
01:07:41,009 --> 01:07:45,949
dump I mean [ __ ] ten thousand worms or

1619
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,630
something like that I might end up push

1620
01:07:45,949 --> 01:07:51,778
amazing is turn that soil all day long

1621
01:07:48,630 --> 01:08:04,229
yeah and if you you your dad go fishing

1622
01:07:51,778 --> 01:08:06,838
yeah but fly fisherman okay so no we've

1623
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:08,879
got we've gotten dope-ass compost now

1624
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:12,150
yeah what do we do with that do we want

1625
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,858
to cut some of that 50% 25% with regular

1626
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:15,479
soil let's let's act like we're gonna

1627
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:17,189
put it into a potted plant to grow

1628
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:19,108
either indoors or outdoors how much is

1629
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:22,048
that compost do you want to use um if

1630
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:24,719
you're building a soil from scratch I

1631
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:28,289
would recommend like 30 40 percent okay

1632
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,658
compost you don't have to use that much

1633
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:32,519
that's just I mean that's ideal 30 it's

1634
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:34,679
available yeah yeah if you've got that

1635
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,819
you know you want to top dress that or

1636
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:38,009
do you want to blend it in when you

1637
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,839
start if you're building the soil I

1638
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:45,359
would totally real kind of blending it

1639
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:47,368
if you are top dressing I would do or to

1640
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,190
say like a quarter cup per gallon

1641
01:08:47,368 --> 01:08:52,559
container okay so if you got a seven

1642
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:56,488
gallon I would recommend three and a

1643
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,830
half cups you did the odd number to

1644
01:08:56,488 --> 01:09:03,048
yourself I don't know what I do the yeah

1645
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:03,048
yeah what I tell the guys at work

1646
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:11,509
and if you're recharging the soil or

1647
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:15,028
like reusing the soil like Jeff does I

1648
01:09:11,509 --> 01:09:17,520
would probably say like 20 percent okay

1649
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:20,069
five percent maybe alright maybe even as

1650
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,529
low as 15 it kind of depends on how much

1651
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:25,440
aeration your soil has and if you want

1652
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,850
to add any end or if or so okay

1653
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,619
aeration is important you guys we

1654
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:30,870
learned our lesson I put some plants

1655
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:32,789
into cocoa and I did not put anything in

1656
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:33,809
there to aerate it and those plants

1657
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:38,548
pretty much gave me the middle finger

1658
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:39,930
their whole lives it's super compressed

1659
01:09:38,548 --> 01:09:42,119
you gonna fill that up with some perlite

1660
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:44,609
put something in there to kind of air it

1661
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:49,170
up for sure alright you can also make

1662
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:52,350
teas with your compost awesome yeah so

1663
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:55,739
with compost make sure you have a

1664
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:58,550
consistent temperature I've been told if

1665
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:01,259
you let it get too warm you can

1666
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:03,659
potentially have some funky stuff okay

1667
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:07,800
and your tea or in the compost itself in

1668
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:11,939
your tea okay all right a lot of people

1669
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:15,300
talk crap about compost or you'll find

1670
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:18,029
people that talk [ __ ] about it one of

1671
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,119
the things they claim is as ecoli of it

1672
01:10:18,029 --> 01:10:23,488
which it possibly could have e.coli in

1673
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,488
it okay but it also has a million other

1674
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:29,579
[ __ ] things that are way nastier than

1675
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:31,529
ecoli that don't karma wouldn't a large

1676
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:33,510
percentage of your fruits and vegetables

1677
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:40,679
have ecoli anyway when you purchased

1678
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:44,550
them okay so would that mean maybe not

1679
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,750
to use a compost tea as a full-year feed

1680
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:47,159
well that's that's the way to get around

1681
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,800
that right just feed it to the roots and

1682
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:52,319
not the full year yeah I personally

1683
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,570
would never use a actual compost tea for

1684
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:58,979
foliar either yeah I would strictly save

1685
01:10:54,569 --> 01:11:00,000
that for worm castings okay yeah so

1686
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:01,109
that's the way to get around that yeah

1687
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,640
don't worry they feed it to the soil

1688
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:05,759
magical happened that you : goes away

1689
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,820
yeah and also with compost you can make

1690
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,750
a concentrate where just take your

1691
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:14,299
compost put it in a cheesecloth

1692
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,560
massage it in water or underneath water

1693
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,060
for about ten minutes

1694
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,140
like you know put it in a bucket of

1695
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:26,030
water just kind of rub it out a little

1696
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:28,510
yeah actually what you're doing you need

1697
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:32,750
it like a loaf of bread okay yeah

1698
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:34,579
perverts and then that makes compost or

1699
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:38,060
worm casting you can do either one a

1700
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:41,090
concentrate and has a longer shelf life

1701
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:44,000
than an aerated tea okay Wow yeah that's

1702
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:46,159
useful something I just learned you're

1703
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,329
taking old food scraps and recycled dirt

1704
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,590
and putting it in cheesecloth and

1705
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:51,319
squeezing it and making your own

1706
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:55,520
nutrients why not do this let's not

1707
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:57,109
making waste companies that do not

1708
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,690
really support the cannabis movement or

1709
01:11:57,109 --> 01:12:01,309
us or our wallets let's stop making

1710
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:05,089
trucks drive across the country with

1711
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:07,010
bottles of water you're paying for what

1712
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,810
would you buy whatever brand to use I

1713
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:11,000
love botanic air but still every time I

1714
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:14,300
buy a bottle of pure Belen Pro or liquid

1715
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,489
karma I had to pay a truck to drive that

1716
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,110
[ __ ] from Arizona to Colorado that I had

1717
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:23,479
to pay some dude or the hydro shot with

1718
01:12:18,109 --> 01:12:25,849
a mullet sell it to me I probably could

1719
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,379
have just taken some kelp and seabird

1720
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,579
guano whatever the [ __ ] else is in that

1721
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:37,550
product and I could have made my own

1722
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:41,260
probably even bench less blue yeah it's

1723
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:44,720
kind of environmentally friendly yes yes

1724
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:46,789
I don't have to add to that truck

1725
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,880
driving that emissions though water

1726
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:52,069
being shipped the gas the exhaust like

1727
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:56,720
we could do it ourselves and not only

1728
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:58,789
that you're diverting food from going

1729
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,369
into the landfill exactly so you're just

1730
01:12:58,789 --> 01:13:03,619
you're basically money from going right

1731
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:05,180
into the same landfill yeah yeah put it

1732
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:07,340
back in your drop back in your wallet

1733
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,560
you're producing something you're not

1734
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,659
depending on someone for that little

1735
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,630
tiny bit of for your life you know it

1736
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:16,670
only may be that part but I love you

1737
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:18,409
know trying to be a producer not a

1738
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:20,119
consumer you know may sound a little

1739
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:23,720
weird but if there's a good feeling

1740
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:24,829
knowing that my vivacious healthy green

1741
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,930
vigorous cannabis

1742
01:13:24,829 --> 01:13:27,949
plants are on nearly the same diet as

1743
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:29,600
myself for sure

1744
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:31,429
it makes me think maybe other than all

1745
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,320
this freaking dr. pepper I'm addicted to

1746
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:35,960
maybe I'm green and vivacious and

1747
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:38,989
vigorous as well keeps me going keeps me

1748
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:40,100
strong alright dude we've been like 40

1749
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:41,510
minutes you got anything else you want

1750
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,620
to talk about composting before we get a

1751
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:52,220
doorbell ring and we get some new

1752
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:59,989
stoners showing up yeah good casting by

1753
01:13:52,220 --> 01:14:02,300
the way comfortable now just stop trying

1754
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:05,179
to build my schedule I've got a busy

1755
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:08,000
life that was all of a sudden well I

1756
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:09,860
don't know I've always had a busy life

1757
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,569
but it you know a few months ago it just

1758
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:14,899
all of a sudden like really stepped up

1759
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:17,359
it's good um yeah so it's good but it's

1760
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:20,750
bad for my podcast and I have all these

1761
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,849
ideals and the you know just plans and

1762
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,840
everything and I'm just trying to adjust

1763
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:27,380
into my schedule

1764
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,239
I understand expect a kick-ass podcast

1765
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,369
coming from me besides the Colorado

1766
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:34,309
podcast are you get a new line coming

1767
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:36,680
yeah excellent so mo go with overhead

1768
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:40,960
and but it's going to be the high-grade

1769
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:44,659
homestead I like that so and it'll be

1770

01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:03,839
typically shirts that are printed with

1962
01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:08,420
logos and stuff the logo goes first I've

1963
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,420
done all of my handmade stuff sure is

1964

1965
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:22,680
of a cartoon characters what they call

1966
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:24,120
me I've been wearing probably I have not

1967
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,829
thrown any of them away I've been

1968
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:28,229
rocking these t-shirts for probably five

1969
01:29:25,829 --> 01:29:29,850
years now and from the first one I have

1970
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,889
not thrown it away the logo is still

1971
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:33,780
crispy the shirt however is getting it's

1972
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:36,980
getting that black shirt tinge to it but

1973
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:36,979
the logo looks like it was fresh

1974
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:45,420
they're sweet shirts so I think we've

1975
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,560
given them a huge shout out big thanks

1976

1980
01:29:51,869 --> 01:29:54,359

1981
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:56,130
I tried a lot of companies handmade

1982
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:58,019
apparel was the most reliable they do

1983
01:29:56,130 --> 01:30:00,390
the artwork in-house and they have the

1984
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,200
pins made so it's all one one groups you

1985
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:03,119

1992
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,250
once you want to chatter about before we

1993
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:28,790

1994
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:30,319
want to jump into let's start off with

1995
01:30:28,789 --> 01:30:31,670
the letter from the DEA they came out

1996
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:33,409
just a couple of days ago and then we

1997
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,970
will do if we have time for it we will

1998
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:35,869
do a couple of election updates because

1999
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:38,240
I know you love getting to that

2000
01:30:35,869 --> 01:30:42,470

2001
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:44,539

2002

2004
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,699
a lot about this project that I'm doing

2005
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:52,309
I've kind of kept it on the down low but

2006
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:55,130
it keeps me busy for 45 or 50 hours a

2007
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:57,140
week so I haven't been doing too podcast

2009
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:01,340
best to get longer episodes and I know

2010
01:30:59,029 --> 01:31:03,920
that the episodes have been a little not

2011
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:09,650
as informative I was over [ __ ] well

2012

I don't give a full informative episode

2023
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:33,649
I feel like I'm kind of treating myself

2024
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:35,239
and the listeners right there are

2025
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:37,369
episodes where I've had to stop and

2026
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:40,489
pause repeatedly while I take notes

2027
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:42,380
they're so hyper detail that's fantastic

2028
01:31:40,489 --> 01:31:44,840
I've got and I know I keep saying I've

2029
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,920

2032
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:51,920
all this page gets more impressive yeah

2033
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,449
I'm gonna do those I'm just I'm trying

2034
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,399
to perfect them those are episodes that

2035
01:31:53,449 --> 01:31:56,689
are gonna be in-depth and I'm kind of a

2036
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:58,729
perfectionist so when they come out like

2037
01:31:56,689 --> 01:32:01,129
that they're really good but on this

2038
01:31:58,729 --> 01:32:02,089
episode we're gonna talk about like I

2039
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:04,100
pulled that background I've been

2040
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:06,500
podcasting Wow in this podcast we're

2041
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,329
gonna talk about a letter that the DEA

2042
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,739
sent who the hell did they send it to do

2043
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:12,649
they just publish it or was it actually

2044
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:16,510
mailed to people this was the big

2045
01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:19,069
dust-up this week the letter clatter

2046
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:22,100
that everyone freaked out about over a

2047
01:32:19,069 --> 01:32:27,920
CB d did your face just break

2048
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:30,289
this story almost broke me the big

2049
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:33,800
dust-up is basically saying the DEA just

2050
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:35,720
made CBD illegal again and that's silly

2051
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:39,619
because it was never legal right we're

2052
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:41,030
gonna we're definitely gonna talk about

2053
01:32:39,619 --> 01:32:43,430
why it's silly and we'll talk about a

2054
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:45,050
lot of details there are a lot of

2055
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:47,570
different versions of this article the

2056
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:50,329
main part that I want to focus on is a

2057
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:53,389
quote the store is a great example of

2058
01:32:50,329 --> 01:32:55,880
just how fake news can be right with

2059
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:57,350
different degrees of [ __ ] they can

2060
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,340
work their way into a press story I've

2061
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:59,840
read it in three or four different

2062
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,510
locations and the part I want to focus

2063
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,069
on is mainly quoted from the DEA

2064
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,720
themselves so that can't be wrong and

2065
01:33:04,069 --> 01:33:07,250
then the the buffers around it we can

2066
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,010
talk [ __ ] about a blot on every website

2067
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:11,420
so this one I chose the one the Leafly

2068
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:13,489
article looked like a crock of [ __ ] to

2069
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:15,770
me I didn't like the Leafly article so I

2070
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:17,840
chose to go with the article from the

2071
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:20,210
Green Rush daily I shout out to the

2072
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,640
Green Rush daily the headline is the DEA

2073
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:24,619
just banned CBD and here's why and

2074
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,300
there's a giant ad and then I finally

2075
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:28,670
scroll like seven Scrolls and I get to

2076
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:30,829
the article it says the legality of CBD

2077
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:33,680
is no longer in the gray area in fact

2078
01:33:30,829 --> 01:33:35,930
the DEA just banned CBD cementing its

2079
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:39,350
place in the list of schedule 1

2080
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:42,650
substances CBD or cannabidiol is a

2081
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:44,570
compound or cannabinoid in cannabis they

2082
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:46,250
won't get you high what it does do

2083
01:33:44,569 --> 01:33:49,579
though is stop seizures and aid and

2084
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:50,600
suffering from dilip elliptic Jesus I'm

2085
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:52,130
the one that wanted to talk [ __ ] about

2086
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,620
an article and I can't speak English

2087
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:56,359
words debilitating is the word I was

2088
01:33:54,619 --> 01:33:58,369
trying to say I kneeled cannabinoid and

2089
01:33:56,359 --> 01:34:01,429
can a video but I can't say debilitating

2090
01:33:58,369 --> 01:34:03,890
you guys sinful especially on a phone

2091
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:05,570
yeah especially after all those dabs the

2092
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:07,820
dabs never help with reading aloud

2093
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:17,899
that's true

2094
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:20,119
I may be the exception to that rule so

2095
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:21,379
why is the DEA putting it on why is the

2096
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:23,630
DEA putting it on the list of the most

2097
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:25,310
harmful drugs available to man probably

2098
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:26,750
the same reasons they temporarily banned

2099
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:28,310
the herbal pain reliever trade on

2100
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,779
earlier this year they're both

2101
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,220
alternatives to more dangerous

2102
01:34:29,779 --> 01:34:33,710
prescription opiates that are plaguing

2103
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:35,320
the country the DEA action seemed to

2104
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:37,210
protect Big Pharma's pocket

2105
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:38,920
more than the health of American

2106
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:40,149
citizens that's not the point that I

2107
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,220
wanted to get you they're talking about

2108
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:43,219
[Music]

2109
01:34:44,038 --> 01:34:51,538
yes just that quick somewhere I wanted

2110
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:51,538
to venture into later in the episode

2111
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,300
because I think that maybe have

2112
01:34:53,828 --> 01:34:56,948
something to do with it they see that if

2113
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,179
there are pharmaceutical companies

2114
01:34:56,948 --> 01:35:00,219
working with it they don't want us

2115
01:34:58,179 --> 01:35:01,690
having that market they want to corner

2116
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:03,130
that before we do so they're just gonna

2117
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:05,589
shut us down like oh no no you can't

2118
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:07,800
even play so now we win they just land

2119
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:09,909
it on free parking by [ __ ] us but I

2120
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,800
want to keep going the archaic spelling

2121
01:35:09,908 --> 01:35:13,719
of the word marijuana with an H is used

2122
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,699
in the text in federal and the Federal

2123
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:17,408
Register announcing the rule probably to

2124
01:35:15,698 --> 01:35:20,578
avoid turning up in marijuana related

2125
01:35:17,408 --> 01:35:36,339
search results oh wow is that true

2126
01:35:20,578 --> 01:35:38,078
no [ __ ] [ __ ] conspiracies yeah I

2127
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:45,099
think this will be helpful for our

2128
01:35:38,078 --> 01:35:49,569
listeners yep because yeah it's that's

2129
01:35:45,099 --> 01:35:51,159
just how the feds spell marijuana and

2130
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:55,139
this is where what a lot of the fake

2131
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:58,569
news is oriented around basically

2132
01:35:55,139 --> 01:36:02,078
everybody has heard of CBD by now coast

2133
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:05,768
to coast the is CBDs a household term

2134
01:36:02,078 --> 01:36:07,479
now people have seen through sanjay

2135
01:36:05,769 --> 01:36:10,210
gupta's specials and through YouTube

2136
01:36:07,479 --> 01:36:11,589
videos and Facebook posts how helpful it

2137
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:14,559
can be with Parkinson's

2138
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:20,319
I wish user disorders with list of a

2139
01:36:14,559 --> 01:36:24,820
syndrome with pain management with the

2140
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:27,448
change in federal policy with the Ogden

2141
01:36:24,819 --> 01:36:29,738
memo and the Cole memo that led to

2142
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:33,729
marijuana markets like we have here in

2143
01:36:29,738 --> 01:36:36,578
Colorado with her legal some of those

2144
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:38,638
like Colorado's included legal hemp in

2145
01:36:36,578 --> 01:36:41,948
so last year the year before the feds

2146
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:45,279
just like the : Ogden memos did for high

2147
01:36:41,948 --> 01:36:48,308
THC cannabis they put out a little blurb

2148
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:51,188
in the farm bill covering industrial

2149
01:36:48,309 --> 01:36:54,309
been putting a definition for what

2150
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:57,338
industrial hemp is and so under the

2151
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:59,458
guise of that legal loophole a number of

2152
01:36:57,338 --> 01:37:02,800
companies both domestic and foreign

2153
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:06,219
started selling TVs or CBD extract

2154
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:08,019
online in all 50 states making it

2155
01:37:06,219 --> 01:37:10,149
available pretty much everywhere

2156
01:37:08,019 --> 01:37:11,409
companies like CBD life water have

2157
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:14,189
sprung up that are trying to get

2158
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:17,198
distribution in all 50 states

2159
01:37:14,189 --> 01:37:19,030
and it's under a gray market loophole

2160
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:21,728
created by the farm bill it is in no way

2161
01:37:19,029 --> 01:37:23,469
legal the feds have always considered

2162
01:37:21,729 --> 01:37:25,329
every part of the cannabis plant it

2163
01:37:23,469 --> 01:37:27,189
doesn't matter if it's the Teva indica

2164
01:37:25,328 --> 01:37:28,238
have ruderalis they don't give a [ __ ] it

2165
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:30,189
let me jump in right there because

2166
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,378
that's right or am in this article and

2167
01:37:30,189 --> 01:37:35,979
they spell it marijuana with an H why

2168
01:37:32,378 --> 01:37:39,189
because these laws are based and [ __ ]

2169
01:37:35,979 --> 01:37:41,739
racism and that was a lot of where that

2170
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:43,539
the original basis for these comes from

2171
01:37:41,738 --> 01:37:45,368
so when the feds write a new marijuana

2172
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:47,768
law it's on the backs of all the old

2173
01:37:45,368 --> 01:37:56,318
marijuana laws and they keep the same

2174
01:37:47,769 --> 01:37:57,579
racist ass smelling I have to get

2175
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:01,359
through this article to make the show

2176
01:37:57,578 --> 01:38:03,099
show the reason given that the u.s. is

2177
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:06,760
complying with the international drug

2178
01:38:03,099 --> 01:38:10,569
control treaties the reason is that they

2179
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:13,059
are stated reason for the change this

2180
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:15,909
week is to help them comply with

2181
01:38:13,059 --> 01:38:18,279
international then they see before this

2182
01:38:15,908 --> 01:38:20,469
elaboration CBDs legality was in a gray

2183
01:38:18,279 --> 01:38:22,358
area it was assumed that CBD extracted

2184
01:38:20,469 --> 01:38:24,309
from medical cannabis was only legal for

2185
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,800
medical marijuana patients any legal to

2186
01:38:24,309 --> 01:38:28,989
the rest however CBD derived from

2187
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,149
industrial hemp was being sold across

2188
01:38:28,988 --> 01:38:33,488
the country as if it were federally

2189
01:38:31,149 --> 01:38:35,229
federally legal well apparently the DEA

2190
01:38:33,488 --> 01:38:39,848
is always believed any form of cannabis

2191
01:38:35,229 --> 01:38:42,280
extract to be Schedule one if I handed

2192
01:38:39,849 --> 01:38:43,659
you a CBD molecule a scientist a CBD

2193
01:38:42,279 --> 01:38:45,969
molecule and I said did this come from

2194
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:47,318
hemp or cannabis he'd probably tell me

2195
01:38:45,969 --> 01:38:50,168
to go [ __ ] myself because it's the same

2196
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:51,699
thing it would say it's a molecule so

2197
01:38:50,168 --> 01:38:53,679
the DEA claims if there are small

2198
01:38:51,698 --> 01:38:55,658
amounts of cannabinoids in every CBD

2199
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,969
extract they cite this as another reason

2200
01:38:55,658 --> 01:38:59,888
to keep CBD on Schedule one for

2201
01:38:57,969 --> 01:39:01,989
practical purposes all extracts that

2202
01:38:59,889 --> 01:39:03,489
contains CBD will also contain

2203
01:39:01,988 --> 01:39:05,799
at least a small amount of other

2204
01:39:03,488 --> 01:39:09,189
cannabinoids however if it were possible

2205
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:11,050
to produce the form of cannabis plant

2206
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:12,189
I'm sorry they wrote this weird there's

2207
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:14,380
an ad right here I'm skipping through it

2208
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:16,238
let's see produce from the cannabis

2209
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:18,279
plant extract they contain only CBD and

2210
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:21,098
no other cannabinoids such an extract

2211
01:39:18,279 --> 01:39:23,710
would fall within the new drug code so

2212
01:39:21,099 --> 01:39:25,389
basically the DEA made extracting CBD

2213
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:27,908
completely illegal whether it's from

2214
01:39:25,389 --> 01:39:29,109
hemp or not whether it is pure CBD cuz

2215
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:30,908
they are wrong right there when they say

2216
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:34,479
that you can't get pure CBD because I

2217
01:39:30,908 --> 01:39:36,009
know thinking counting I can put five

2218
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:37,839
fingers up and confidently say that I

2219
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:40,030
know five people but I could call

2220
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,769
friends that can make CBD isolate is

2221
01:39:40,029 --> 01:39:44,050
ninety-nine point eight or nine percent

2222
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:46,210
CBD that one or two percent is

2223
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:47,980
atmospheric conditions there are things

2224
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:52,510
like oxygen in there that they cannot

2225
01:39:47,979 --> 01:39:54,069
control it's you can get 100% pure CBD

2226
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:57,820
lots of different places

2227
01:39:54,069 --> 01:39:59,439
the DEA is position on it doesn't have

2228
01:39:57,819 --> 01:40:02,558
anything to do with their being trace

2229
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:04,149
cannabinoids in it that's just something

2230
01:40:02,559 --> 01:40:06,849
that happened to mumble during the press

2231
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:09,038
conference so it's always been always

2232
01:40:06,849 --> 01:40:12,550
been illegal just like every part of the

2233
01:40:09,038 --> 01:40:15,550
cannabis plant is illegal federally the

2234
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:17,920
seeds are illegal though the leaves the

2235
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:21,489
root ball is illegal the pot you grew it

2236
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:26,319
it is illegal it doesn't matter if it's

2237
01:40:21,488 --> 01:40:29,618
industrial hemp every year I'm just to

2238
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:31,719
be safe every eighteen months some drug

2239
01:40:29,618 --> 01:40:33,939
task force somewhere like East [ __ ]

2240
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:35,170
Texas makes the announcement that

2241
01:40:33,939 --> 01:40:37,928
they've just found the world's biggest

2242
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:40,389
pot farm and they're raiding it today

2243
01:40:37,929 --> 01:40:43,599
and they didn't catch any growers and

2244
01:40:40,389 --> 01:40:45,940
it's headline news on Monday and it's

2245
01:40:43,599 --> 01:40:47,380
headline news on Tuesday and then

2246
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:50,408
there's nothing about it in the press on

2247
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:51,969
Wednesday and next Friday comes out that

2248
01:40:50,408 --> 01:40:56,319
it was a wild Hempfield

2249
01:40:51,969 --> 01:40:59,019
on some farmers back it's 400 400 acres

2250
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:00,518
in the middle of nowhere and it was the

2251
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:04,210
weather conditions that spring were

2252
01:41:00,519 --> 01:41:07,329
perfect for feral hemp to go nuts and

2253
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:09,010
the DEA I'll spend $100,000 ripping all

2254
01:41:07,328 --> 01:41:11,738
of that feral hemp out of the ground and

2255
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:13,239
burning it because it's the dangerous

2256
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,599
marijuana plant it doesn't matter that

2257
01:41:13,238 --> 01:41:15,549
it's

2258
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,870
while that doesn't have any tears if you

2259
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,789
smoked any of that stuff if you

2260
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:20,050
harvested dried and cured it properly

2261
01:41:18,789 --> 01:41:23,350
all that [ __ ] would do is give you a

2262
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:25,529
headache there's an Indian Reservation I

2263
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:27,670
want to say it was in New Mexico

2264
01:41:25,529 --> 01:41:31,719
somewhere hot and kind of miserable to

2265
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:33,159
live where feral hemp was just

2266
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,680
everywhere they couldn't do anything

2267
01:41:33,159 --> 01:41:38,409
about it it was an issue and they'd

2268
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:40,090
found a way to basically build whole

2269
01:41:38,409 --> 01:41:41,409
houses with it with hemp creed and a

2270
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:44,619
couple of other products and they were

2271
01:41:41,409 --> 01:41:46,170
doing it all on site in the feds would

2272
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:49,420
show up every now and again and burn

2273
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:52,149
their em down because it's dangerous

2274
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:54,670
hemp I mean this happens all over the

2275
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:56,829
country the DEA wastes small fortunes

2276
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:58,630
ripping wild hemp plants out of the

2277
01:41:56,829 --> 01:42:00,519
ground that are left over from the 30s

2278
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:02,859
and 40s when hemp was grown as a crop

2279
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:04,690
all over the US when there's a terrible

2280
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:07,689
heroin epidemic everywhere right now

2281
01:42:04,689 --> 01:42:09,699
like Colorado Springs is littered with

2282
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:10,750
crystal meth meth is everywhere in

2283
01:42:09,699 --> 01:42:12,279
Springs people are driving around on

2284
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:14,470
bicycles look in the [ __ ] trash cans

2285
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:16,329
all over Colorado Springs Pueblo it

2286
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:18,039
level is dead it's Friday night right

2287
01:42:16,329 --> 01:42:19,600
now you guys it's Friday night at 10:30

2288
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:21,159
it's [ __ ] quiet all the people that

2289
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,570
used to be out raging doing heroin not

2290
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:24,369
all but I mean a good [ __ ] portion of

2291
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:26,469
our young people are out doing heroin

2292
01:42:24,369 --> 01:42:28,420
right now and the DEA is worried about

2293
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:32,079
[ __ ] with plants they keep us cool I

2294
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:35,829
mean not even cannabis just fun cannabis

2295
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:39,760
that I guess you stoned and it helped

2296
01:42:35,829 --> 01:42:40,809
just know if you make jeans with houses

2297
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,989
bricks

2298
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:45,940
textiles necklaces right there's an

2299
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:48,460
infinite number of products you can make

2300
01:42:45,939 --> 01:42:50,349
with with hemp and that was part of the

2301
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:53,020
the reason they they included the

2302
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:56,470
exemption in the farm bill last year the

2303
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:59,890
year before to to designate what exactly

2304
01:42:56,470 --> 01:43:02,650
is industrial hemp because everybody I

2305
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:06,250
mean everybody everybody understands how

2306
01:43:02,649 --> 01:43:08,559
absurd our hemp laws are but as far as

2307
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:10,210
law enforcement is concerned cops can't

2308
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,400
tell the difference between half and

2309
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:13,869
weed and they're pretty sure you can

2310
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:16,179
grow the two next to each other so you

2311
01:43:13,869 --> 01:43:18,819
could heart hide your high THC plants

2312
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:20,530
and among your hemp plants which anyone

2313
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,889
that's ever growing either crop knows

2314
01:43:20,529 --> 01:43:23,688
how insane that is

2315
01:43:21,889 --> 01:43:26,059
but law enforcement across the country

2316
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:28,639
still argue [ __ ] like that in federal

2317
01:43:26,059 --> 01:43:30,800
court well to keep the DEA noted since

2318
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,949
all Asians like this and Saul's growing

2319
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:36,139
a bunch of it's all CBD plants and it

2320
01:43:33,948 --> 01:43:37,728
looks like killer cannabis plants if

2321
01:43:36,139 --> 01:43:39,649
they told me that that was White Widow

2322
01:43:37,729 --> 01:43:41,030
or something I honestly couldn't tell

2323
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:43,969
the difference on their plants they've

2324
01:43:41,029 --> 01:43:46,038
got can't very cannabis looking some of

2325
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:47,748
them can be very very similar it depends

2326
01:43:46,038 --> 01:43:51,018
what the hemp you're growing has been

2327
01:43:47,748 --> 01:43:54,800
bred to do yeah and if I understand

2328
01:43:51,019 --> 01:43:57,380
what's doing is they're producing CBD

2329
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,809
extract it looks like it grows just like

2330
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:03,109
feel and that's the type of F you would

2331
01:43:59,809 --> 01:44:04,729
want for a high CBD extra production but

2332
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:07,938
that I'm guessing that hemp strain would

2333
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:09,769
be crap if they tried to make oil and

2334
01:44:07,939 --> 01:44:11,570
fiber it's not fibrous

2335
01:44:09,769 --> 01:44:13,579
I mean that's one of the great things

2336
01:44:11,569 --> 01:44:15,168
about cannabis is it can be bred one way

2337
01:44:13,578 --> 01:44:18,529
or the other to achieve an infinite

2338
01:44:15,168 --> 01:44:20,658
number absolutely of final products but

2339
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:22,609
as far as the feds are concerned every

2340
01:44:20,658 --> 01:44:26,118
single part of its illegal the only

2341
01:44:22,609 --> 01:44:28,038
legal hemp or marijuana products that

2342
01:44:26,118 --> 01:44:30,529
are federally legal in the United States

2343
01:44:28,038 --> 01:44:32,868
are hemp clothing produced in other

2344
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:34,728
countries are produced from fabric that

2345
01:44:32,868 --> 01:44:39,438
was grown in other countries silly low

2346
01:44:34,729 --> 01:44:42,769
friends and and I mean products that

2347
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:45,949
were produced with plant material grown

2348
01:44:42,769 --> 01:44:50,510
in other countries everything else is at

2349
01:44:45,948 --> 01:44:53,478
least gray market the FDA and a couple

2350
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:55,820
other national safety organizations

2351
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:58,219
release the thing we even did a blurb

2352
01:44:55,819 --> 01:45:00,679
about it on the show about the foreign

2353
01:44:58,219 --> 01:45:04,309
companies selling you god knows what is

2354
01:45:00,679 --> 01:45:06,199
CBD extract random [ __ ] in there yep

2355
01:45:04,309 --> 01:45:07,429
they were testing and it didn't have a

2356
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:09,738
lot of CBD in it

2357
01:45:07,429 --> 01:45:12,050
or maybe it did but it had a lot other

2358
01:45:09,738 --> 01:45:15,248
crap and you didn't want us along with

2359
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:15,248
it is filler

2360
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:19,729
that's what you get in a gray market you

2361
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,909
get a lot of knockoff products you get a

2362
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:25,039
lot of mislabeled products and this is

2363
01:45:22,909 --> 01:45:26,720
why I've been freaking out about getting

2364
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:28,489
people politically active disease just

2365
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,930
doing this for their own financial gain

2366
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:31,159
do you think the pharmaceutical

2367
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:34,579
companies are planning something with

2368
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:36,139
CBD products um there's a couple in

2369
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:39,170
Great Britain and around the country

2370
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:43,400
that are already working with THC CBD

2371
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:46,100
products GW Pharmaceuticals is working a

2372
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:48,229
couple of different product lines but

2373
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,860
there's still five ten years from market

2374
01:45:48,229 --> 01:45:52,789
okay

2375
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:57,679
I'm sure the industry don't that don't

2376
01:45:52,789 --> 01:45:59,720
want THC and see like they would prefer

2377
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:03,970
to I as an industry I'm sure they would

2378
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:06,590
prefer to have control of all

2379
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:09,199
medications that people can't eat yeah

2380
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:10,460
but that's not physically possible they

2381
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,079
don't want to make any better they want

2382
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:14,750
to mask my symptoms and keep feeding me

2383
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:16,489
a pill to make me a customer ingredients

2384
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:18,979
like the one conspiracy theory you're

2385
01:46:16,489 --> 01:46:21,529
gonna get me to buy into anywhere but

2386
01:46:18,979 --> 01:46:24,019
with a decision like this this is just

2387
01:46:21,529 --> 01:46:26,029
business as usual this is the exact same

2388
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:28,580
I mean this has been true since nineteen

2389
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:30,559
forty if people are freaking out about

2390
01:46:28,579 --> 01:46:32,899
this decision today because they issued

2391
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:36,980
it it's a owned serial number so they

2392
01:46:32,899 --> 01:46:38,869
can track the caesars separately and I

2393
01:46:36,979 --> 01:46:40,779
mean I encourage the move because

2394
01:46:38,869 --> 01:46:43,970
tracking [ __ ] separately is helpful

2395
01:46:40,779 --> 01:46:45,979
right now any anti marijuana group is

2396
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:48,409
gonna tell you that ten years ago

2397
01:46:45,979 --> 01:46:50,359
fifteen years ago the average THC

2398
01:46:48,409 --> 01:46:53,000
content in marijuana was one to three

2399
01:46:50,359 --> 01:46:56,269
percent and they can back that up with

2400
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,710
DEA seizure numbers and the reason

2401
01:46:56,270 --> 01:47:00,260
that's true is because they've been

2402
01:46:57,710 --> 01:47:08,000
seizing fields of [ __ ] barrel hemp

2403
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:09,680
every year for decades and I mean it's

2404
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,229
always been illegal this is nothing new

2405
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:14,570
a tracking it separately helps us figure

2406
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:17,089
out okay exactly how much did they waste

2407
01:47:14,569 --> 01:47:18,739
ripping up half out of the ground how

2408
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:20,449
much money did they waste making sure

2409
01:47:18,739 --> 01:47:23,179
Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last

2410
01:47:20,449 --> 01:47:25,099
year how much money did they waste

2411
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:25,480
rounding up hemp seed off the inner or

2412
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,550
have

2413
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:30,969
off the side of the highway as you drive

2414
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:33,640
to New Mexico I mean it's nuts how many

2415
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:36,550
people since they've got these companies

2416
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:39,340
that are shipping CBD ah they're gonna

2417
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:40,600
have to like the people there's a couple

2418
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:41,560
I don't know if I want to say anybody's

2419
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,239
names I don't - getting people in

2420
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,530
trouble but I know people personally and

2421
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:46,569
there are companies in Colorado that

2422
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:48,309
will ship CBD products nationwide you

2423
01:47:46,569 --> 01:47:50,049
can be in Maine name in California and

2424
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:53,500
they will send you a bottle of CBD

2425
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:56,230
t-shirt how are those people that were

2426
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:57,819
relying on those medicine what are they

2427
01:47:56,229 --> 01:48:00,849
gonna do now that's who I'm mainly

2428
01:47:57,819 --> 01:48:03,460
worried about they're screwed yeah but

2429
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:06,670
they were always like their access was

2430
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:08,199
only obtained through a gray market and

2431
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:10,149
if they were paying attention they knew

2432
01:48:08,199 --> 01:48:14,139
that and they've been lobbying for a

2433
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:17,589
different way to access whatever product

2434
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:19,960
they desperately need in their area um I

2435
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:22,210
would love to say come to Colorado and

2436
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:24,819
we've got CBD for you but there is a CBD

2437
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:25,779
drought it the only way like everybody

2438
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:28,059
thinks they're gonna come to Colorado

2439
01:48:25,779 --> 01:48:30,488
and go to a medical dispensary and get

2440
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:35,110
Heidi CBD medicine and they are highly

2441
01:48:30,488 --> 01:48:38,859
disappointed there is not much is

2442
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:40,599
expensive because it's it's there's been

2443
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:42,599
a shortage for a while you've got to

2444
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:44,920
find yourself a private caregiver

2445
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,210
squeezed out of the system now anyway or

2446
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:48,220
you've got a girl yourself and then

2447
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:49,810
you've got to find a CBD clone or you

2448
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:51,640
got to find seeds or something high CBD

2449
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:54,280
and then you've got to grow it and then

2450
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:55,630
you've got to get it tested or I don't

2451
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:56,859
know people focus a little bit too much

2452
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:58,630
on testing when it comes to personal

2453
01:48:56,859 --> 01:48:59,979
medicine I think I'm gonna do an episode

2454
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:02,800
on this I'm gonna write this down I

2455
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:04,209
think that the medicine I think if

2456
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,529
medicine works for you it works for you

2457
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:07,060
don't pay attention to the lab testing

2458
01:49:05,529 --> 01:49:09,340
there's a lot of elaboration I want to

2459
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:11,289
do on that but we'll see there's a lot

2460
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:15,190
of stuff that lab testing brought to the

2461
01:49:11,289 --> 01:49:16,960
community that's just bizarre people

2462
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:20,919
focus on all the wrong numbers and

2463
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:23,460
that's I mean I loved watching the CBD

2464
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:27,430
industry explode over the last two years

2465
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:29,590
I don't take that from what I'm saying

2466
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:32,140
because I think that should be available

2467
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:33,969
to everyone everywhere I think this

2468
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:36,160
society would be a lot better if more

2469
01:49:33,969 --> 01:49:38,529
people were adding CBD to their diets

2470
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:40,448
regularly as a supplement

2471
01:49:38,529 --> 01:49:42,759
it helps with a bunch of stuff I'm a

2472
01:49:40,448 --> 01:49:44,138
huge CBD advocate I use it daily what's

2473
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:48,128
your daily dose of CBD

2474
01:49:44,139 --> 01:49:50,128
right now I'm restricting myself because

2475
01:49:48,128 --> 01:49:52,988
the product I'm using I'm limited on

2476
01:49:50,128 --> 01:49:53,918
accessing anymore of it ever that won't

2477
01:49:52,988 --> 01:49:56,498
happen

2478
01:49:53,918 --> 01:49:58,748
it's gone the person that's making it is

2479
01:49:56,498 --> 01:50:00,668
gone and so I'm kind of making it last

2480
01:49:58,748 --> 01:50:04,359
so is the worst part about this product

2481
01:50:00,668 --> 01:50:08,590
yep and right now I'm it two or three

2482
01:50:04,359 --> 01:50:10,208
CBD devs a day okay um and I spaced them

2483
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:11,828
throughout the day and it depends if I'm

2484
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:13,359
not hurting that day maybe I only take

2485
01:50:11,828 --> 01:50:16,808
one maybe I'll take just a little

2486
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:19,139
itty-bitty one maybe I'll just use some

2487
01:50:16,809 --> 01:50:23,019
of the pain cream I've got left in store

2488
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:27,819
but that's not purpose I'm purposefully

2489
01:50:23,019 --> 01:50:30,189
going slow before then or like when I

2490
01:50:27,819 --> 01:50:35,049
was taking it is milligrams pills it was

2491
01:50:30,189 --> 01:50:36,010
50 milligrams a day morning 25 at night

2492
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:38,229
I was my next question

2493
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:41,889
okay 25 so 25 to keep you pain-free a

2494
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:44,409
day 25 to get you sleep well just making

2495
01:50:41,889 --> 01:50:46,300
it easy cuz I never kind of went wild

2496
01:50:44,408 --> 01:50:48,938
with it because I liked it half and half

2497
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:51,969
THC CBD and I didn't want to be eating

2498
01:50:48,939 --> 01:50:54,610
50 milligrams of THC before like I went

2499
01:50:51,969 --> 01:50:57,038
out and did my day so I was keeping it

2500
01:50:54,609 --> 01:51:00,128
225 and then adding more during the day

2501
01:50:57,038 --> 01:51:02,109
if I needed to okay but I can consume

2502
01:51:00,128 --> 01:51:03,760
human huge amounts of CBD when I'm

2503
01:51:02,109 --> 01:51:07,238
hurting like I've got an issue with

2504
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,010
through the vertebrae in my back and it

2505
01:51:07,238 --> 01:51:10,628
doesn't happen often but every now and

2506
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:13,449
then they Twain off each other kind of

2507
01:51:10,628 --> 01:51:15,878
like a rubber band and that feeling is

2508
01:51:13,448 --> 01:51:19,688
pretty excruciating and then the area

2509
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:21,868
around where those two twang will get

2510
01:51:19,689 --> 01:51:24,459
inflamed and hurt for several days and

2511
01:51:21,868 --> 01:51:28,299
to a degree where I can't really bend

2512
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:30,010
her work and if I feel its twang and I

2513
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:32,409
eat a whole bunch of CBD likes because

2514
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:34,119
300 milligrams right away it won't

2515
01:51:32,408 --> 01:51:37,268
inflame to the point where I'm down the

2516
01:51:34,118 --> 01:51:39,219
next day that's I was yeah I've heard a

2517
01:51:37,269 --> 01:51:41,229
lot about if you get on it as soon as

2518
01:51:39,219 --> 01:51:43,538
you feel it it like as soon as you feel

2519
01:51:41,229 --> 01:51:45,340
it get that like get that CBD edible in

2520
01:51:43,538 --> 01:51:48,908
you and if you can take a DAB because

2521
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:50,470
dab is it's instant absorption yeah dab

2522
01:51:48,908 --> 01:51:53,139
is instant not just

2523
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:55,060
but any inhalation through the lungs

2524
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:57,100
that that makes it to the bloodstream

2525
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,510
incredibly quickly you get relief in

2526
01:51:57,100 --> 01:52:01,180
seconds yep

2527
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:03,489
it's it's seconds and if you eat it

2528
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:06,340
you're looking at I mean half hour per

2529
01:52:03,489 --> 01:52:08,109
hour hour and a half two hours before

2530
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:11,739
you you've got full effect of what

2531
01:52:08,109 --> 01:52:13,539
you've consumed the effect of what you

2532
01:52:11,739 --> 01:52:16,420
eat is gonna be a little stronger but

2533
01:52:13,539 --> 01:52:18,850
that delayed if you're taking it for

2534
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:24,310
pain you can't wait two hours for your

2535
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:28,170
painful to kick in right but CBD was

2536
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:28,170
never legal in all 50 states

2537
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:34,029
you just called that back like a

2538
01:52:29,859 --> 01:52:37,329
professional kiddies it was a loophole

2539
01:52:34,029 --> 01:52:39,909
that everybody was operating under and I

2540
01:52:37,329 --> 01:52:42,100
mean it was so glaringly obvious a

2541
01:52:39,909 --> 01:52:46,899
loophole that Chinese companies know

2542
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:48,490
fall over it and obviously that was

2543
01:52:46,899 --> 01:52:50,649
gonna get shut down at some point and

2544
01:52:48,489 --> 01:52:54,969
that's not even what this was this was

2545
01:52:50,649 --> 01:52:56,829
this was just the DEA a serial number

2546
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:58,270
for when they do seizures they didn't

2547
01:52:56,829 --> 01:52:59,890
even release a letter saying we're gonna

2548
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:03,490
go after the people selling this [ __ ]

2549
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:06,100
online it's just a reminder that all

2550
01:53:03,489 --> 01:53:08,369
parts of the cannabis plant are illegal

2551
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:10,990
most of our community is still not

2552
01:53:08,369 --> 01:53:12,460
politically aware let alone privately

2553
01:53:10,989 --> 01:53:13,659
active but that's what we're here for

2554
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:15,180
that's why I bring you on Mike because

2555
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:19,029
you can remind them and you can turn

2556
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:20,500
huge I mean huge segments of the

2557
01:53:19,029 --> 01:53:23,139
population not just the marijuana

2558
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:25,989
community got this story wrong I'm

2559
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:28,240
freaked out about it and they're tying

2560
01:53:25,989 --> 01:53:31,329
it to every conspiracy theory there is

2561
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:35,229
we gets marijuana legalization like I

2562
01:53:31,329 --> 01:53:37,659
read a whole on a fairly reputable news

2563
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:40,029
site it was an opinion piece that they

2564
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:42,630
chose to publish about because they used

2565
01:53:40,029 --> 01:53:45,579
the marijuana with an H spelling in this

2566
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:48,730
that it was that was because Trump was

2567
01:53:45,579 --> 01:53:52,059
elected in racism is now openly accepted

2568
01:53:48,729 --> 01:53:54,369
and that this was medication today was

2569
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:56,950
gonna round up the stoners and the

2570
01:53:54,369 --> 01:53:59,019
Mexicans and this was published in a pen

2571
01:53:56,949 --> 01:54:02,260
and I'm reading this like okay geez

2572
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:04,719
like we've come so far we just had a

2573
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:08,320
huge night on election night marijuana

2574
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:11,079
won big in so many places in the first

2575
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:14,500
thing we do to celebrate is give

2576
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:16,719
ourselves a black eye and then another

2577
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:19,090
in another in another in another in

2578
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:22,329
another I mean we didn't need a fake

2579
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:26,310
news shitstorm this week there's enough

2580
01:54:22,329 --> 01:54:30,159
real news that we should be focused on

2581
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:34,140
and because so much of our community

2582
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:37,329
isn't aware of the legalities nationally

2583
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:40,510
for this plan we all love this story's

2584
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:44,289
spread like wildfire I've seen half a

2585
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:46,270
dozen businesses down here posted and

2586
01:54:44,289 --> 01:54:47,859
it's like you're a marijuana store you

2587
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:51,910
should have known this better than ever

2588
01:54:47,859 --> 01:54:53,920
yeah yeah the businesses the CBD

2589
01:54:51,909 --> 01:54:56,859
businesses that we're sending this [ __ ]

2590
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,719
through the mail their lawyers should

2591
01:54:56,859 --> 01:55:01,299
have made this perfectly clear to them

2592
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:04,119
that they're operating in a legal gray

2593
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:07,090
area through a loophole in a [ __ ]

2594
01:55:04,119 --> 01:55:09,159
farm bill I mean that as far as the feds

2595
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:11,500
are concerned all parts of the cannabis

2596
01:55:09,159 --> 01:55:14,979
plant are illegal regardless of THC

2597
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:17,680
content it can be just the root ball of

2598
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:19,509
a hemp plant that dried up earth was

2599
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:21,400
harvested two years ago and it's still

2600
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:24,699
illegal you can still be charged for the

2601
01:55:21,399 --> 01:55:25,149
federal crime for having it wow that's

2602
01:55:24,699 --> 01:55:27,670
scary

2603
01:55:25,149 --> 01:55:29,710
yeah and that's that's just the reality

2604
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:31,600
of our situation that's why I have so

2605
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:34,869
much respect for even the marijuana

2606
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:42,789
business owners I really hate because

2607
01:55:34,869 --> 01:55:59,349
there's everyday going alright we've

2608
01:55:42,789 --> 01:56:00,699
talked about this alright so thanks for

2609
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:02,530
listening to the DEA part we're gonna

2610
01:56:00,699 --> 01:56:04,090
move on to a little bit of updating

2611
01:56:02,529 --> 01:56:08,199
stuff of things we've talked about in

2612
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:11,489
the past because on our post-election

2613
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:11,488
episode we mentioned that a

2614
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,138
it was the little bit of bad news we had

2615
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:19,618
for for Pueblo for our election night

2616
01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:22,769
there was a election question should we

2617
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:24,658
allow retail marijuana stores inside

2618
01:56:22,769 --> 01:56:38,159
Pueblo city was it called on the ballot

2619
01:56:24,658 --> 01:56:40,649
what's that we thought it did not pass

2620
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:43,859
on Allah when we recorded our

2621
01:56:40,649 --> 01:56:47,638
post-election show it was it was failing

2622
01:56:43,859 --> 01:56:49,109
by like 150 or 200 votes and by the time

2623
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:51,150
they got all of the provisional ballots

2624
01:56:49,109 --> 01:56:54,238
counted and all the ballots that were

2625
01:56:51,149 --> 01:56:58,229
stuck together and what not counted we

2626
01:56:54,238 --> 01:57:01,348
won by like 5 or 600 votes nice so we

2627
01:56:58,229 --> 01:57:02,759
will be able to have recreational

2628
01:57:01,349 --> 01:57:07,230
cannabis stores within the city limits

2629
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:08,880
of Pueblo um December 27th I believe the

2630
01:57:07,229 --> 01:57:12,979
City Council is the Tuesday after

2631
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:16,618
Christmas city council will be voting on

2632
01:57:12,979 --> 01:57:18,859
the final rules and regs package for Rex

2633
01:57:16,618 --> 01:57:21,969
Rex shops

2634
01:57:18,859 --> 01:57:21,969
[Music]

2635
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:29,909
unfortunately I've been involved with

2636
01:57:27,988 --> 01:57:31,649
this for a long time so I know way more

2637
01:57:29,908 --> 01:57:32,698
about it than I should even the people

2638
01:57:31,649 --> 01:57:34,578
that are working on it right now I

2639
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:37,138
probably know more about it than they do

2640
01:57:34,578 --> 01:57:40,679
the ordinance that they're about to vote

2641
01:57:37,139 --> 01:57:42,900
and probably pass on passed into law was

2642
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:45,599
written by a Zoning Commission that was

2643
01:57:42,899 --> 01:57:50,129
very dead set against allowing marijuana

2644
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:52,769
businesses in the city at all and at a

2645
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:56,760
certain point they discovered that with

2646
01:57:52,769 --> 01:57:58,619
one or two zoning buffer rules so 1,000

2647
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:01,230
feet from schools and 300 feet from

2648
01:57:58,618 --> 01:58:03,328
residences that they could essentially

2649
01:58:01,229 --> 01:58:06,538
limit the number of marijuana businesses

2650
01:58:03,328 --> 01:58:08,488
in the city because that's all the

2651
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:11,729
property that's physically available to

2652
01:58:08,488 --> 01:58:14,759
make sense if they they include those

2653
01:58:11,729 --> 01:58:16,888
two buffer zones and to make that even

2654
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:18,630
more restrictive they've decided to

2655
01:58:16,889 --> 01:58:20,389
limit the total number of stores in the

2656
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:22,010
city to 8

2657
01:58:20,389 --> 01:58:26,989
for north of the river for south of the

2658
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:29,899
river they've the city is preparing for

2659
01:58:26,988 --> 01:58:32,678
a wave of applications and they've come

2660
01:58:29,899 --> 01:58:35,090
up with a point system in a time line

2661
01:58:32,679 --> 01:58:37,699
for that application process to take

2662
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:39,110
place so hopefully by the end of the

2663
01:58:37,698 --> 01:58:40,969
year we've got at least a couple of

2664
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:42,438
recent marijuana shops open in Puebla

2665
01:58:40,969 --> 01:58:45,469
that'd be cool

2666
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:47,360
yeah I I wish the the rules were that

2667
01:58:45,469 --> 01:58:50,359
we're about to pass are different or

2668
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:53,658
we're different are different but that's

2669
01:58:50,359 --> 01:58:55,458
very unlikely I'm doing what I can to

2670
01:58:53,658 --> 01:58:57,938
get some of the craziness to be taken

2671
01:58:55,458 --> 01:58:59,748
out of them but there's only so much

2672
01:58:57,939 --> 01:59:02,059
change that they're willing to make

2673
01:58:59,748 --> 01:59:05,179
right now they're catching on they're

2674
01:59:02,059 --> 01:59:07,550
kind of slowly evolving this is a very

2675
01:59:05,179 --> 01:59:10,819
different City Council than the one we

2676
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:13,159
had a year or two years ago I mean this

2677
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:17,058
is a full process that started four

2678
01:59:13,158 --> 01:59:18,978
years ago it's been four full years that

2679
01:59:17,059 --> 01:59:22,010
the city has been working on this

2680
01:59:18,979 --> 01:59:23,689
particular set of rules and regs that's

2681
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:26,149
how long I've been working on it do you

2682
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:27,739
think since we had the first shop do you

2683
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:32,869
think we could get just first in line

2684
01:59:27,738 --> 01:59:35,178
like hey no come on just play that card

2685
01:59:32,868 --> 01:59:37,219
okay we was here most of that part of

2686
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:39,019
the city is blacked out due to schools

2687
01:59:37,219 --> 01:59:42,828
because the thousand-foot from schools

2688
01:59:39,019 --> 01:59:46,760
rule isn't just classrooms where they're

2689
01:59:42,828 --> 01:59:50,328
students if the college owns an empty

2690
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:52,099
apartment on whatever street then

2691
01:59:50,328 --> 01:59:54,828
there's a thousand foot buffer around

2692
01:59:52,099 --> 01:59:57,828
that apartment around that empty

2693
01:59:54,828 --> 02:00:01,279
apartments property line yeah yeah does

2694
01:59:57,828 --> 02:00:03,168
the library in such kill not for not for

2695
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:08,868
these this rule package like that tends

2696
02:00:03,168 --> 02:00:12,139
not to matter um there were several

2697
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:14,630
other buffer zones listed around our

2698
02:00:12,139 --> 02:00:16,609
medical shops um which is why they've

2699
02:00:14,630 --> 02:00:20,199
been allowed with no store cap for four

2700
02:00:16,609 --> 02:00:20,198
or five years and we only have three

2701
02:00:21,029 --> 02:00:25,800
I move the stoning rules you can really

2702
02:00:23,429 --> 02:00:28,260
limit the allowed businesses in an area

2703
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,230
and this is why if your area passed

2704
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:34,860
legalization recently you really need to

2705
02:00:31,229 --> 02:00:36,718
brush up on local politics and get down

2706
02:00:34,859 --> 02:00:38,179
to planning and zoning in City Council

2707
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:40,288
or County Commission meetings now

2708
02:00:38,179 --> 02:00:45,359
because these rules are being decided

2709
02:00:40,288 --> 02:00:48,118
for your area right now I mean if you're

2710
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:51,089
not involved people who do give a [ __ ]

2711
02:00:48,118 --> 02:00:53,098
enough to show up it's their voice that

2712
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:54,538
helps craft these rules and if it's two

2713
02:00:53,099 --> 02:00:56,819
people that really hate weed for one

2714
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:59,389
reason or another in one person that

2715
02:00:56,819 --> 02:01:02,819
loves weed but is really an articulate

2716
02:00:59,389 --> 02:01:04,349
expect ugly rules yeah if you know how

2717
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:05,460
to grow and you were all about talking

2718
02:01:04,349 --> 02:01:06,929
with City Council go down there

2719
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:08,550
represent them tell them why they're

2720
02:01:06,929 --> 02:01:10,679
there guidelines aren't gonna work for a

2721
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:13,500
typical girl you know I was thinking

2722
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:16,920
about I think I cannot recall buying

2723
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:18,868
cannabis in a Pueblo dispensary since

2724
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,300
the legalization of recreational

2725
02:01:18,868 --> 02:01:23,189
cannabis that's the last time I can

2726
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:26,760
remember shopping in a blow dispensary I

2727
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:29,279
rarely shop in a store but I'm actually

2728
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:30,809
get out to the stores as often as

2729
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:45,538
possible just to see what everybody's

2730
02:01:30,809 --> 02:01:48,989
doing yes yes and also our good friends

2731
02:01:45,538 --> 02:01:50,759
at elevate glass and and so that was the

2732
02:01:48,988 --> 02:01:52,138
good news that we screwed up on election

2733
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,030
right that was our big blooper from that

2734
02:01:52,139 --> 02:01:55,529
show yes the next thing I've got written

2735
02:01:54,029 --> 02:01:58,069
down you can see it it says Maine if you

2736
02:01:55,529 --> 02:02:00,059
want to tell us about Maine go for Maine

2737
02:01:58,069 --> 02:02:03,299
Maine voted to legalize recreational

2738
02:02:00,059 --> 02:02:07,380
marijuana the vote passed by a very very

2739
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:10,440
very very slim margin statewide it was

2740
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:11,010
like votes or something it was very very

2741
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:14,689
close

2742
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:17,210
so the anti-pop people forced a recount

2743
02:02:14,689 --> 02:02:21,000
costing the state half a million bucks

2744
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:25,020
that recount is underway now it's paused

2745
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:28,139
for the weekend they've counted all of

2746
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:30,840
the cities in county areas that the

2747
02:02:28,139 --> 02:02:32,730
anti-pop people were sure we're gonna

2748
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:34,349
give them the numbers to reverse the

2749
02:02:32,729 --> 02:02:38,038
vote

2750
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:40,828
and the the outcome hasn't changed

2751
02:02:38,038 --> 02:02:42,359
legalization is still winning and the

2752
02:02:40,828 --> 02:02:45,509
really funny part of the story to me is

2753
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:48,479
uh so in Maine the election rules if you

2754
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:50,610
push for a recount and you get it the

2755
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:53,279
pro side and the anti side for whatever

2756
02:02:50,609 --> 02:02:56,368
issues getting recounted have to send

2757
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:58,710
ten volunteers every day to the recount

2758
02:02:56,368 --> 02:03:00,179
option office like you know it still

2759
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:03,389
cost the state half a million dollars to

2760
02:03:00,179 --> 02:03:07,260
do this even with using volunteers from

2761
02:03:03,389 --> 02:03:10,739
the campaigns and the anti-pop people in

2762
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:14,190
Maine can't get ten fifty show up every

2763
02:03:10,738 --> 02:03:15,319
day and so the the recounts taken a lot

2764
02:03:14,189 --> 02:03:17,969
longer than it should have

2765
02:03:15,319 --> 02:03:21,538
election staffers have had to stand in

2766
02:03:17,969 --> 02:03:23,368
and cover for anti legalization

2767
02:03:21,538 --> 02:03:27,238
volunteers that weren't able to make it

2768
02:03:23,368 --> 02:03:28,920
on time or were late several days a

2769
02:03:27,238 --> 02:03:30,509
couple days in a row when this first

2770
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,440
started and it just happened again here

2771
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:34,710
at the end of the week didn't have

2772
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:37,288
enough people show luckily the pro pop

2773
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:40,739
people have had extra volunteers willing

2774
02:03:37,288 --> 02:03:42,389
to work and have been willing to work

2775
02:03:40,738 --> 02:03:45,058
some longer hours to make sure that this

2776
02:03:42,389 --> 02:03:47,699
gets recounted correctly correctly and

2777
02:03:45,059 --> 02:03:49,590
accurately so that the recount is still

2778
02:03:47,698 --> 02:03:50,149
on track to finish up when it's supposed

2779
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:52,529
to

2780
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:54,948
but the anti-pop people were so

2781
02:03:52,529 --> 02:03:57,268
convinced that they had this in the bag

2782
02:03:54,948 --> 02:04:00,479
I'm so convinced that they had the

2783
02:03:57,269 --> 02:04:02,159
majority of people that they forced the

2784
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:03,538
recount in a million and a half million

2785
02:04:02,158 --> 02:04:04,319
in taxes to be spent they can't even get

2786
02:04:03,538 --> 02:04:06,809
ten volunteers

2787
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:08,429
that's funny come on now how many how

2788
02:04:06,809 --> 02:04:12,750
many things are still being recounted

2789
02:04:08,429 --> 02:04:15,449
nationwide um total election why there's

2790
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:19,439
a bunch but it's all little stuff okay

2791
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:20,969
is statewide issues there well there

2792
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:23,219
aren't that many that are still counting

2793
02:04:20,969 --> 02:04:25,859
four full weeks right since the election

2794
02:04:23,219 --> 02:04:29,368
every County is a huge process because

2795
02:04:25,859 --> 02:04:32,038
it's done by hand and basically so in

2796
02:04:29,368 --> 02:04:35,819
Maine the ten people from each side pair

2797
02:04:32,038 --> 02:04:37,319
up and then they're given an election an

2798
02:04:35,819 --> 02:04:38,609
election person and then those three

2799
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:42,689
people goes through the table

2800
02:04:38,609 --> 02:04:44,670
and you look at the ballot in both of

2801
02:04:42,689 --> 02:04:46,368
the the Pro and the anti people agree

2802
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:48,949
that that's a yes vote

2803
02:04:46,368 --> 02:04:50,299
in the third guy there from the Election

2804
02:04:48,948 --> 02:04:52,009
Commission's there to make sure that the

2805
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:57,219
to the eighth I and the pro people don't

2806
02:04:52,010 --> 02:05:00,409
fight nice and follow the rules I mean I

2807
02:04:57,219 --> 02:05:01,760
mean this it takes an insane amount of

2808
02:05:00,408 --> 02:05:03,198
time on election night they're just

2809
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,300
funneling these [ __ ] throwing machine

2810
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:07,098
if you can do thousands a minute or

2811
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:10,029
thousands a second unless you're Pueblo

2812
02:05:07,099 --> 02:05:10,029
trash you're [ __ ]

2813
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:16,579
[Music]

2814
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:18,710
but the recount is an incredibly taxing

2815
02:05:16,579 --> 02:05:21,260
process but there aren't that many that

2816
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:23,270
are still going I'm typically by now one

2817
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:25,550
side is gone okay the vote clearly

2818
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:28,880
hasn't changed we're down to just the

2819
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:31,820
tiny towns or the areas that voted

2820
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:34,279
strongly one way or the other it's not

2821
02:05:31,819 --> 02:05:37,488
gonna matter let's let's let it go and

2822
02:05:34,279 --> 02:05:39,679
they've conceded at this point I'm the

2823
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:41,059
anti pot thing or the anti pot group in

2824
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:43,250
Maine is one of the few holdouts that

2825
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:46,460
are still fighting they don't have a

2826
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:48,229
chance so what this means if you happen

2827
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:51,439
to listen to the podcast and you live in

2828
02:05:48,229 --> 02:05:52,368
Maine way first shout out for listening

2829
02:05:51,439 --> 02:05:55,129
we appreciate it

2830
02:05:52,368 --> 02:05:57,649
i'm ii get involved locally cuz in a

2831
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:59,599
couple of weeks when all this is said

2832
02:05:57,649 --> 02:06:04,039
and done and it's official and marijuana

2833
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:06,440
is legal at best you're gonna be talking

2834
02:06:04,039 --> 02:06:08,060
to local government officials who will

2835
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:11,689
be saying over and over and over again

2836
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:13,969
well the vote was really close so we

2837
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:16,609
hear what both sides are saying we're

2838
02:06:13,969 --> 02:06:18,139
gonna give the anti pot people nine out

2839
02:06:16,609 --> 02:06:19,819
of the ten things they want and we're

2840
02:06:18,139 --> 02:06:21,590
gonna give the pro marijuana people 1

2841
02:06:19,819 --> 02:06:23,929
out of the 10 things they want because

2842
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:25,579
it was a close vote and if you don't get

2843
02:06:23,929 --> 02:06:28,719
on top of it now and figure out exactly

2844
02:06:25,579 --> 02:06:31,219
how these rules get made in your area

2845
02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:33,618
you're gonna be driving a really long

2846
02:06:31,219 --> 02:06:36,649
distance to the only dispensary in your

2847
02:06:33,618 --> 02:06:38,210
area and it's gonna be crazy expensive

2848
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:42,379
to buy weed though if it's mean it won't

2849
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:44,868
be that far then still cold I honestly

2850
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:47,840
have no idea exactly how big that state

2851
02:06:44,868 --> 02:06:50,210
is but I don't want to drive 45 minutes

2852
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:52,099
to the weed store no I don't want to

2853
02:06:50,210 --> 02:06:53,689
drive 20 minutes doesn't mean you gotta

2854
02:06:52,099 --> 02:06:56,210
drive 45 minutes home before you can

2855
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:58,039
smoke that new weed yep and if there's

2856
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:58,849
just give me a nostalgic feeling

2857
02:06:58,039 --> 02:07:00,019
remember one needs to go to the

2858
02:06:58,849 --> 02:07:02,720
dispensary yeah I don't have it

2859
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:04,040
now I'm sorry I'm jaded but I remember

2860
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:06,020
the feeling I just took a fat dab you

2861
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:07,310
guys I apologize for the chokes while

2862
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:09,560
Mike was on his rant there I took a

2863
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:11,450
couple dabs normally you just go to the

2864
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:14,150
dispensary and you'd be like oh you want

2865
02:07:11,449 --> 02:07:17,210
one yeah I got you I've got the hash if

2866
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:19,670
you've got a dad you just don't use that

2867
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:22,779
email because it's kind of quiet it to

2868
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:28,940
be quiet and I use a torch there's a

2869
02:07:22,779 --> 02:07:30,259
torch yes Shantanu our friends at

2870
02:07:28,939 --> 02:07:34,609
elevate for keeping me stocked up on

2871
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:37,280
fresh bangers remember that feeling when

2872
02:07:34,609 --> 02:07:38,630
he would go to the light I would I would

2873
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:40,039
do Rob kind of a nerd I would do

2874
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:41,630
research online and find out what the

2875
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:43,760
hottest strains are in Denver or in

2876
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:45,079
Colorado and I would go find that if it

2877
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,329
was a Bruce Banner I'd go find where

2878
02:07:45,079 --> 02:07:48,619
they had some Bruce Banner what was the

2879
02:07:47,329 --> 02:07:51,979
strain that they had at the Denver

2880
02:07:48,619 --> 02:07:59,000
relief they had the biodiesel got the

2881
02:07:51,979 --> 02:08:02,569
biodiesel that's not from TGA sub cool I

2882
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:06,220
was going to the clinic on Mexico in

2883
02:08:02,569 --> 02:08:08,389
Denver and I was getting the vortex wax

2884
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:09,619
and I would say how much do you have of

2885
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:11,539
that and they'd said this much and I'd

2886
02:08:09,619 --> 02:08:15,109
say I'll take it yeah they started

2887
02:08:11,539 --> 02:08:16,340
sending limits because the first week

2888

2889
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:28,850
the girls screwed yeah thanks that was

2890
02:08:26,869 --> 02:08:31,010
actually when I bought my hitman rig but

2891
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:32,120
uh so I remember the feeling I would get

2892
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:33,680
when I would leave the dispensary with

2893
02:08:32,119 --> 02:08:35,779
that specific strain that I was so

2894
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:37,490
excited about going to find it's like

2895
02:08:35,779 --> 02:08:38,899
like skip it's like almost the feeling

2896
02:08:37,489 --> 02:08:40,880
was a little kidding I'd get a new video

2897
02:08:38,899 --> 02:08:42,920

2899
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:46,190
I gotta go home and show my friends and

2900
02:08:45,170 --> 02:08:48,109
you'd go home and call one of your

2901
02:08:46,189 --> 02:08:49,399
buddies and this is the same thing would

2902
02:08:48,109 --> 02:08:51,349
happen with weed you'd go home and call

2903
02:08:49,399 --> 02:08:53,029

2904

02:08:56,239 --> 02:08:59,449
jar closed until you got here so that

2908
02:08:58,250 --> 02:09:02,840
when I cracked it open it was just

2909
02:08:59,449 --> 02:09:04,489
[ __ ] Oh biodiesel in the face and then

2910
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:06,289
we grind a little bit of it up and smoke

2911
02:09:04,489 --> 02:09:09,050
it together to be like that anticipation

2912
02:09:06,289 --> 02:09:10,250
from the car to the house of like oh god

2913

2915
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:19,020
home from picking up weed for sure hmm

2916
02:09:16,948 --> 02:09:23,039
hmm when that was like an hour 20 minute

2917
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:27,050
drive that was stressful like by the

2918
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:27,050
time you got home that adrenaline high

2919
02:09:27,079 --> 02:09:42,840
Dan's on the show but that adrenaline

2920
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:44,300
high from driving home reward it's like

2921
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:46,949
I finally made it

2922
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:53,520
I felt like an almost is more of a

2923
02:09:46,948 --> 02:09:55,198
reward ace to get higher used to be a

2924
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:58,199
mission a STONER mission you'd have to

2925
02:09:55,198 --> 02:09:59,579
find do you have weed there'd be two or

2926
02:09:58,198 --> 02:10:01,349
three guys would be that first guy you'd

2927
02:09:59,579 --> 02:10:03,210
always want to try and he was my friend

2928
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:05,940
bad eyes and his name started with a J

2929
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:07,560
if you're my Creed I hate that guy first

2930
02:10:05,939 --> 02:10:09,719
all the time see if he's got that Sour

2931
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:11,310
Diesel if not and try a couple other

2932
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:12,869
dudes but if you gotta find out where

2933
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:14,130
they are if they got what you want

2934
02:10:12,869 --> 02:10:15,179
and if they can meet you somewhere then

2935
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:16,710
you gotta meet up somewhere do you got

2936
02:10:15,179 --> 02:10:18,750
to sit in a sketchy parking lot or go to

2937
02:10:16,710 --> 02:10:22,170
a sketchy house and then you got to get

2938
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:24,630
it I always had three or four people but

2939
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:27,149
on my way to work I would head up my

2940
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:29,159
favorite and my lunch if I ain't heard

2941
02:10:27,149 --> 02:10:30,779
back I would head up the other two yep

2942
02:10:29,159 --> 02:10:32,909
there you go by the end of the day

2943
02:10:30,779 --> 02:10:35,250
guaranteed one of them would have hit me

2944
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:38,698
back and then I'd go way too sketchy

2945
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:44,250
parking lot yep I don't miss those days

2946
02:10:38,698 --> 02:10:46,500
I kind of Miss that extra high from the

2947
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:50,250
adrenaline Drive and the anticipation

2948
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:53,670
but I feel it every time that I do hit a

2949
02:10:50,250 --> 02:10:58,289
dispensary now or even when I come over

2950

3048
02:14:41,149 --> 02:14:45,408
is so nice that this it was literally

3049
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:47,300
the only part of my life where I was way

3050
02:14:45,408 --> 02:14:48,529
out of whack with legal

3051
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:51,199
I've actually been kicked out of

3052
02:14:48,529 --> 02:14:53,899

02:14:53,899 --> 02:15:00,229
and come back I had someone walk up and

3055
02:14:57,770 --> 02:15:04,489

3065
02:15:22,819 --> 02:15:31,309
that you wear at that facility we pretty

3066
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:33,079
much sat around a table just like this

3067
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:36,050
in our t-shirts and shorts and trimmed

3068
02:15:33,079 --> 02:15:38,090
with rubber gloves on and then we would

3069
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:38,989
go smoke at a friend's house cuz it was

3070

3074
02:15:43,819 --> 02:15:48,349
drove right to the food place you gonna

3075
02:15:47,779 --> 02:15:50,869

3078
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:00,679
restaurant but the place was filled with

3079
02:15:58,310 --> 02:16:02,960
families like you could see people

3080
02:16:00,679 --> 02:16:05,619
looking at us offended like you can

3081
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:08,149

3085
02:16:13,369 --> 02:16:17,569
blame restaurants with like I don't care

3086
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:19,939
what you do for work all day if you're

3087
02:16:17,569 --> 02:16:21,079
if you're funky you know from it to funk

3088
02:16:19,939 --> 02:16:23,029
out a whole restaurant

3089
02:16:21,079 --> 02:16:24,649
you probably shouldn't go straight from

3090
02:16:23,029 --> 02:16:29,269
work the restaurant like I don't care

3091
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:31,250
what you do or why you stink some

3092
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:34,130
restaurants back in the day when I

3093
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:35,808
noticed before we had legal the cannabis

3094
02:16:34,129 --> 02:16:37,429
legalization and it was a known thing I

3095
02:16:35,808 --> 02:16:38,779
would show up to restaurants with my

3096
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:40,099
scuzzy looking friends because I know

3097
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:43,670
I'm not the cleanest looking person I

3098
02:16:40,099 --> 02:16:45,319
bathe on a regular basis yes but I do

3099
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:47,239
look like Chewbacca's [ __ ] baby

3100
02:16:45,319 --> 02:16:49,129
cousin I've got dreadlocks past my ass

3101
02:16:47,239 --> 02:16:50,119
almost to my knees I've got a fuzzy

3102
02:16:49,129 --> 02:16:52,429
beard you can hear it

3103
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:53,319
that's my beard I got a goatee I got a

3104
02:16:52,429 --> 02:16:55,599
mustache

3105
02:16:53,318 --> 02:16:57,879
I wore a crooked hat and a t-shirt and

3106
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:59,318
Dickie's and skateboard shoes and I walk

3107
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:00,789
into restaurants and back in the day and

3108
02:16:59,318 --> 02:17:02,318
I smell like wheat I just constantly

3109
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:04,000
smell like herb if I'm growing it

3110
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:06,068
smoking it whatever I smell like

3111
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,540
cannabis I would walk into restaurants

3112
02:17:06,068 --> 02:17:09,308
and they would kind of roll their eyes

3113
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:11,920
and be like [ __ ] let's sit these weirdos

3114
02:17:09,308 --> 02:17:14,858
in a corner now that the industry is the

3115
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:17,558
way that it is they know that kids it

3116
02:17:14,859 --> 02:17:19,000
look like myself and you and Kev bro and

3117
02:17:17,558 --> 02:17:21,188
whoever else used to roll with me to

3118
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,079
places they treat us like [ __ ] rock

3119
02:17:21,189 --> 02:17:24,460
stars now bro in the grimy Gatsby and I

3120
02:17:23,079 --> 02:17:27,099
would go to dinner in Colorado Springs

3121
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:28,209
that waitress would be up our butts cuz

3122
02:17:27,099 --> 02:17:29,769
they know it's like these are weed

3123
02:17:28,209 --> 02:17:31,629
industry people and they get paid well

3124
02:17:29,769 --> 02:17:35,439
I'm gonna be super [ __ ] nicely that's

3125
02:17:31,629 --> 02:17:38,848
not they get paid well they get paid

3126
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:42,420
well now and in the near future in the

3127
02:17:38,849 --> 02:17:46,148
very recent past they worked a job where

3128
02:17:42,420 --> 02:17:50,349
tips or at least service was a big part

3129
02:17:46,148 --> 02:17:52,299
of it right so when we go out to eat now

3130
02:17:50,349 --> 02:17:53,739
we understand that the person serving us

3131
02:17:52,299 --> 02:17:57,849
our food is making less than minimum

3132
02:17:53,739 --> 02:18:00,218
wage and that if one or two of her table

3133
02:17:57,849 --> 02:18:01,960
stiffs are throughout a shift she's

3134
02:18:00,218 --> 02:18:05,199
gonna have trouble making ends meet and

3135
02:18:01,959 --> 02:18:07,568
so if the service is good we always over

3136
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,800
tip yeah yeah just as a community we

3137
02:18:07,568 --> 02:18:11,468
kind of take care of it I can always

3138
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:14,590
when I was doing food service I could

3139
02:18:11,468 --> 02:18:16,750
always tell which one of my tables which

3140
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:18,969
customers also worked in the service it

3141
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:20,978
was I've heard every one of my food

3142
02:18:18,968 --> 02:18:23,589
service friends has said that before yep

3143
02:18:20,978 --> 02:18:25,718
you can always tell and you can tell

3144
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:26,978
who's like no one and their families

3145
02:18:25,718 --> 02:18:28,898
worked in the service industry in a

3146
02:18:26,978 --> 02:18:31,799
couple of generations but you can tell

3147
02:18:28,898 --> 02:18:34,510
those [ __ ] too from a mile away and

3148
02:18:31,799 --> 02:18:37,388
it I mean it makes a big difference if

3149
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:38,559
you're a server to know who to treat a

3150
02:18:37,388 --> 02:18:41,529
little better I love it when you take a

3151
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:42,789
girl on the dinners over she starts

3152
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:45,399
gathering plates and sets them at the

3153
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:51,040
edge of the table you're awesome but

02:20:44,469 --> 02:20:50,829
first person I ever met that was juicing

3203
02:20:46,299 --> 02:20:53,789
raw cannabis like when they defoliate

3204
02:20:50,829 --> 02:20:56,950
take all that leaf material in juice

3205
02:20:53,790 --> 02:21:00,480
they toss the crunchy but when they do

3206
02:20:56,950 --> 02:21:03,190
fully anus the grain they juice all that

3207
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:05,049
she uses the stuff that she's vaporized

3208
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:06,851
she makes a tincture with coconut oil

3209
02:21:05,049 --> 02:21:08,560
out of that or a topical with coconut

3210
02:21:06,851 --> 02:21:09,190
oil out of that she makes a cannabis

3211
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,409
lotion

3212
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:14,140
she has been making cannabis products

3213
02:21:11,409 --> 02:21:15,521
for her cats recently like so if you

3214
02:21:14,139 --> 02:21:17,560
guys want a different perspective on

3215
02:21:15,521 --> 02:21:18,700
cannabis if you get tired of hearing our

3216
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:20,140
bro culture over here

3217
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:21,700
I understand some people aren't into

3218
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:22,810
being called dude and bro I listen to a

3219
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:24,101
podcast all the time but if you've

3220
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:26,681
gotten this far and you must be into us

3221
02:21:24,101 --> 02:21:29,290
but a different perspective on cannabis

3222
02:21:26,681 --> 02:21:30,909
from a very well-educated professional

3223
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:33,250
sounding woman if you want a woman's

3224
02:21:30,909 --> 02:21:34,659
perspective on cannabis I highly

3225
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:36,819
recommend listening to the spliff

3226
02:21:34,659 --> 02:21:40,750

3243
02:22:24,819 --> 02:22:27,340
would appreciate the show if you like my

3244
02:22:25,931 --> 02:22:31,120
show i feel like you'll like buzz show

3245
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:33,640
she is got 63 episodes up right now nice

3246
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:35,681
I am 30-something episodes in and

3247
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:38,069
they're getting better and better as

3248
02:22:35,681 --> 02:22:41,800
they go she's really good at

3249
02:22:38,069 --> 02:22:46,149
recommending specific dosages of

3250
02:22:41,799 --> 02:22:48,189
cannabinoids and she's much she doesn't

3251
02:22:46,149 --> 02:22:52,629
over consume cannabis the way that I do

3252
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:54,700
so she's much more on the beginner

3253
02:22:52,629 --> 02:22:55,329
consumer side which I'm not even bashing

3254
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:57,670
anybody

3255
02:22:55,329 --> 02:22:59,799
I miss my lower tolerance right I was

3256
02:22:57,670 --> 02:23:02,260
able to do some really amazing things

3257
02:22:59,799 --> 02:23:06,369
with some low-dose cannabinoid changes

3258
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:08,469
and I'm a little ridiculous I'm

3259
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:11,290
Chewbacca's freaking cousin and I like

3260
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:13,119
to over dab I like to overmedicate so if

3261
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:14,590
you but that's enough of a shoutout for

3262
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:15,730
Bo I support that show listen to it it's

3263
02:23:14,590 --> 02:23:18,101
[ __ ] great I like it so that's

3264
02:23:15,729 --> 02:23:20,109
something that I wrote down and then

3265
02:23:18,101 --> 02:23:23,220
we're gonna read an article about

3266
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:25,659

3267
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:27,729

3268
02:23:25,659 --> 02:23:28,810
ppm Ross yes because they think it's

3269
02:23:27,729 --> 02:23:32,029
something that needs to be talked about

3270
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:37,708
you got now retreated to stick around

3271

3396
02:29:35,889 --> 02:29:38,618
costs of the podcast out of my pocket

3397
02:29:37,449 --> 02:29:40,689
everybody that shows up for the show

3398
02:29:38,619 --> 02:29:41,949
gets a bottle of water I try to buy

3399
02:29:40,689 --> 02:29:43,988
these little microphone covers these

3400
02:29:41,949 --> 02:29:45,578
things here I try to replace these quite

3401
02:29:43,988 --> 02:29:46,898
frequently because you guys coughing to

3402
02:29:45,578 --> 02:29:49,059
them and they stink and I don't want

3403
02:29:46,898 --> 02:29:50,680
people having to share that funky [ __ ]

3404
02:29:49,059 --> 02:29:53,139
I've made that trip to the store with

3405
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:56,199
you yes yes and if you're really dying

3406
02:29:53,139 --> 02:29:57,599
for old content this is a way to help

3407
02:29:56,199 --> 02:29:59,879
make that happen

3408
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:02,010
Wow the reason it's not up there right

3409
02:29:59,879 --> 02:30:03,869
now is because it would like double or

3410
02:30:02,010 --> 02:30:08,338
triple the cost to maintain the web

3411
02:30:03,869 --> 02:30:10,859
hosting to go all 171 it's 171 now yeah

3412
02:30:08,338 --> 02:30:13,289
they go 171 deep that kind of volume and

3413
02:30:10,859 --> 02:30:20,689
storage cost I don't want to make that

3414
02:30:13,289 --> 02:30:23,459
promise yeah if somebody didn't make the

3415
02:30:20,689 --> 02:30:26,220
proper patreon contribution and it may

3416
02:30:23,459 --> 02:30:29,270
said post an old episode [ __ ] that's

3417
02:30:26,219 --> 02:30:31,679
the way to get me to do what you want

3418
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:35,640
money talks it's Christmas time and

3419
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:37,050
money talks but but I'm not trying to be

3420
02:30:35,639 --> 02:30:38,849
that way I'm saying one dollar goes a

3421
02:30:37,049 --> 02:30:41,398
long way if you don't have a dollar to

3422
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:42,959
contribute I do not I do I'm not

3423
02:30:41,398 --> 02:30:46,248
offended I still love you I still want

3424
02:30:42,959 --> 02:30:46,249
you to listen I still want you to grow

[Music]

3426
02:30:54,588 --> 02:30:59,520
that's a good way to look at it I guess

3427
02:30:56,818 --> 02:31:01,198
that's all I want is that so by the time

3428
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,699
I'm too old to fight this fight anymore

3429
02:31:01,199 --> 02:31:04,859
that it's taken care of enough for me to

3430
02:31:02,699 --> 02:31:05,970
just enjoy the ride there you go all I'm

3431
02:31:04,859 --> 02:31:06,959
asking for is help paying for the

3432
02:31:05,969 --> 02:31:10,639
website and buying these little

3433
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:10,640
microphone covers and water bottles and

3434
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:14,640

3435
02:31:13,318 --> 02:31:16,109

3436
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:17,760

3608

3609
02:39:59,609 --> 02:40:03,088

3619
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:26,988
friends throughout the state a bunch of

3620
02:40:24,779 --> 02:40:30,328
people up in Monument oddly enough and

3621
02:40:26,988 --> 02:40:32,219
they see our city government stuff and

3622
02:40:30,328 --> 02:40:34,351
they see a lot of our press okay

3623
02:40:32,219 --> 02:40:41,789
and so they would call further up

3624
02:40:34,351 --> 02:40:51,810
my parents but then I would get the

3625
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:55,230
phone call from my my folks so Mike and

3626
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:57,931
I I happen to be the first person to buy

3627
02:40:55,229 --> 02:41:00,329
recreational cannabis in the county of

3628
02:40:57,931 --> 02:41:02,521
Pueblo Colorado when we legalized the

3629
02:41:00,329 --> 02:41:04,829
sale of recreational cannabis photos of

3630
02:41:02,521 --> 02:41:07,801
the line Jeff got to be first in are

3631
02:41:04,829 --> 02:41:10,229
still used all the time in national

3632
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:12,090
press stories about legalization there's

3633
02:41:10,229 --> 02:41:15,029
two photos that were taken that day in

3634
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:17,250
Pueblo they're both aerial shots and

3635
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:19,860
Jeff is shopping while that photo is

3636
02:41:17,250 --> 02:41:30,569
being taken first so I'm in there buying

3637
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:32,730
stuff I was first and so I I've got a

3638
02:41:30,569 --> 02:41:34,739
picture of myself actually purchasing

3639
02:41:32,729 --> 02:41:36,899
cannabis like the money transaction of

3640
02:41:34,739 --> 02:41:38,101
handing it money and then the owner of

3641
02:41:36,899 --> 02:41:39,840
the dispensary is a good friend of mine

3642
02:41:38,101 --> 02:41:41,130
so I shook his hand like thanks bro I'm

3643
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,239
glad that I could be your first customer

3644
02:41:41,129 --> 02:41:47,189
I'm proud of you for having this [ __ ]

3645
02:41:44,239 --> 02:41:48,810
I shook his hand told him thank you I

3646
02:41:47,190 --> 02:41:49,980
turned around and my other friend to

3647
02:41:48,810 --> 02:41:51,239
work then I said thanks guys and I

3648
02:41:49,979 --> 02:41:54,750
grabbed my stuff and I left it when I

3649
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:57,810
walked outside I was interviewed by 8:00

3650
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:59,729
news stations and documentary makers and

3651
02:41:57,810 --> 02:42:01,681
documentarians I guess there were a lot

3652
02:41:59,729 --> 02:42:03,029
of cameras around me I'm really glad

3653
02:42:01,681 --> 02:42:04,620
that I'm a well-spoken dude because that

3654
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:07,380
would have been overwhelming for [ __ ]

3655
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:09,840
most normal people that was crazy but a

3656
02:42:07,379 --> 02:42:11,579
lot of that footage so also that day

3657
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:13,979
there was a newscaster there who I ended

3658
02:42:11,579 --> 02:42:16,590
up making friends with and she was like

3659
02:42:13,979 --> 02:42:18,720

3660
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:20,909

3661
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,079

02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:26,879
friends so that we can film that and I

3665
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:28,500
was like actually that's highly illegal

3666
02:42:26,879 --> 02:42:31,079
I can't smoke in front of my friends

3667
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:33,720

02:42:51,068 --> 02:42:59,859
some really nice shots for them to get

3678
02:42:54,009 --> 02:43:03,429
in we didn't think about the optics of

3679
02:42:59,859 --> 02:43:07,238
it necessarily from people who aren't

3680
02:43:03,429 --> 02:43:10,478
from because we were used to dabbing by

3681
02:43:07,238 --> 02:43:13,898
them yeah we were used to the equipment

3682
02:43:10,478 --> 02:43:16,389
that goes with it the parts the process

3683
02:43:13,898 --> 02:43:19,148
the people that came over to interview

3684
02:43:16,389 --> 02:43:22,718
us and see this little session none of

3685
02:43:19,148 --> 02:43:25,689
them were familiar with superseded the

3686
02:43:22,718 --> 02:43:28,478
one lady there was a cameraman there was

3687
02:43:25,689 --> 02:43:30,609
a news reporter who was from the TV news

3688
02:43:28,478 --> 02:43:34,448
and then there was a write a newspaper

3689
02:43:30,609 --> 02:43:37,059
writer and the newspaper writer hinted

3690
02:43:34,449 --> 02:43:40,270
mentioned talked about cannabis that she

3691
02:43:37,059 --> 02:43:41,769
liked cannabis she wanted to say she was

3692
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:43,270
saying without saying I'd love to

3693
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:44,529
[ __ ] smoke that bowl with you guys

3694
02:43:43,270 --> 02:43:47,738
but all these [ __ ] right here would

3695
02:43:44,529 --> 02:43:51,418
snitch on me is what she was saying and

3696
02:43:47,738 --> 02:43:55,418
we did our best of completely hotbox

3697
02:43:51,418 --> 02:43:56,559
basically a suburban home yeah and it

3698
02:43:55,418 --> 02:43:58,898
didn't take much with three grown men

3699
02:43:56,559 --> 02:44:01,028
here yeah in the twenty thirty minutes

3700
02:43:58,898 --> 02:44:04,418
they were here filming and interviewing

3701
02:44:01,029 --> 02:44:06,488
people we a non-stop had a break in a

3702
02:44:04,418 --> 02:44:08,679
bowl in a joint going around the table

3703
02:44:06,488 --> 02:44:10,779
so that it one in any given moment one

3704
02:44:08,679 --> 02:44:12,668
of us was hitting everything I thought

3705
02:44:10,779 --> 02:44:15,189
that camera was gonna touch me I was

3706
02:44:12,668 --> 02:44:17,648
taking a dad a big dad was worried about

3707
02:44:15,189 --> 02:44:19,509
his his lens at one point he got really

3708
02:44:17,648 --> 02:44:23,708
really close you know and I was like bro

3709
02:44:19,509 --> 02:44:26,379
that's like you really don't want to get

3710
02:44:23,709 --> 02:44:29,588
any closer but that that shot that

3711
02:44:26,379 --> 02:44:30,939
actual shot is shown on the news so

3712
02:44:29,588 --> 02:44:32,798
frequently when they talk about

3713
02:44:30,939 --> 02:44:35,039
marijuana they show me take a big dam

3714
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:39,819
and blow it out like oh I feel relieved

3715
02:44:35,039 --> 02:44:42,838
yeah so I'm sure that is interesting so

3716
02:44:39,818 --> 02:44:45,338
luckily they don't use me taking the dab

3717
02:44:42,838 --> 02:44:47,588
nearly as frequently as they used you

3718
02:44:45,338 --> 02:44:51,459
but they still use that footage

3719
02:44:47,588 --> 02:44:53,139
regularly that footage we saw we agreed

3720
02:44:51,459 --> 02:44:55,719
that that footage can be used in

3721
02:44:53,139 --> 02:44:57,639
anything it's like either ABC or NBC is

3722
02:44:55,718 --> 02:44:58,689
what news organization that was for so

3723
02:44:57,639 --> 02:45:00,879
it's there's now

3724
02:44:58,690 --> 02:45:02,590
if and so it's shown all over the nation

3725
02:45:00,879 --> 02:45:04,390
when they talk about cannabis and I get

3726
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:06,340

hook you up with the best deal possible

3792
02:48:16,490 --> 02:48:21,681
to get your products printed I think

3793
02:48:19,399 --> 02:48:23,630
they've got a 25 piece minimum so let's

3794
02:48:21,681 --> 02:48:25,131
charge you for 25 pieces plus a small

3795
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:26,600
setup fee because they do have to make

3796
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:28,100
screens too so I'm not sure if their

3797
02:48:26,601 --> 02:48:42,560
screens anymore now that [ __ ] happens

3798

shout out to handmade apparel shun I

3828
02:49:36,979 --> 02:49:40,490
think it was Adam hand they did it

3829
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:42,351
himself I think Adam had adjusted the

3830
02:49:40,490 --> 02:49:46,820
art because the art I sent him was a

3831
02:49:42,351 --> 02:49:48,711
little pixely I was made by yeah it was

3832
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:49,829
made by somebody else that's not a super

3833
02:49:48,710 --> 02:49:51,209
amazing graphic

3834
02:49:49,829 --> 02:49:52,649
but it was the right idea for what I

3835
02:49:51,209 --> 02:49:54,209
wanted handmade apparel took it and

3836
02:49:52,649 --> 02:49:55,350
polished it up it looks super dope it

3837
02:49:54,209 --> 02:49:58,849
looks super slick so they can handle

3838
02:49:55,350 --> 02:50:00,750
your artwork everything I he thinks very

3839
02:49:58,850 --> 02:50:03,180
open-mindedly so if he describes

3840
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:06,030
something to Adam he can draw it without

3841
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:07,860
ruining your idea he can put your idea

3842
02:50:06,030 --> 02:50:09,360
into motion if you're not an artist

3843
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:11,430
which is really cool cuz a lot of

3844
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:14,130
artists want to put their idea into your

3845
02:50:11,430 --> 02:50:17,909
idea and then put it on paper and then

3846
02:50:14,129 --> 02:50:19,139
there goes your idea anyway much love

3847
02:50:17,909 --> 02:50:21,090
mad respect to our friends at handmade

3848
02:50:19,139 --> 02:50:22,229
apparel let's tell everybody what this

3849
02:50:21,090 --> 02:50:23,670
show is gonna be about because I feel

3850
02:50:22,229 --> 02:50:34,649
like we've been gone for a really long

3851
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:37,350
time came down the pipe for Colorado

3852
02:50:34,649 --> 02:50:38,940
concentrate companies yes I found this

3853
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:40,229
article on leaf Lee because it was the

3854
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:42,180
only place I could find with this

3855
02:50:40,229 --> 02:50:45,869
article after I did some searching and

3856
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:48,989
it says rule changes aren't they're not

3857
02:50:45,870 --> 02:50:51,510
sexy and so they didn't make the press

3858
02:50:48,989 --> 02:50:54,449
there's no other way to describe it it's

3859
02:50:51,510 --> 02:50:56,489
it's not it's not something

3860
02:50:54,450 --> 02:51:00,720
controversial it's not something that

3861
02:50:56,489 --> 02:51:03,000
there was big heated debate over

3862
02:51:00,719 --> 02:51:04,579
we're like anti pop people and pro pop

3863
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:07,139
people were fighting in the courthouse

3864
02:51:04,579 --> 02:51:08,039
or anything so he didn't make the press

3865
02:51:07,139 --> 02:51:09,930
a lot it was quiet

3866
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:11,250
all right let's read the article this is

3867
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:13,200
from leaf Lee I'm looking for the author

3868
02:51:11,250 --> 02:51:15,629
Ben Alden and this was written on

3869
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:17,940
December 12 2016 of course this episode

3870
02:51:15,629 --> 02:51:20,250
is coming out on December 26th I hope

3871
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:21,899
everybody had a wonderful winter holiday

3872
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:24,000
whichever one that it is you celebrate

3873
02:51:21,899 --> 02:51:26,699
we're not gonna be inclusive exclusive

3874
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:28,771
racist or biased or whatever we love you

3875
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:31,021
all whatever gender you have chosen to

3876
02:51:28,771 --> 02:51:35,760
identify as whatever holiday you were

3877
02:51:31,021 --> 02:51:38,280
accepting I mean that's the truth goes

3878
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:40,530
like this on January 1st 2017 Colorado

3879
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:42,690
will raise its state-regulated limit on

3880
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:45,480
the residual levels of volatile solvents

3881
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:47,130
allowed in cannabis concentrates it's a

3882
02:51:45,479 --> 02:51:48,569
little noticed rule change that involves

3883
02:51:47,129 --> 02:51:51,179
dramatically increased levels of

3884
02:51:48,569 --> 02:51:52,319
allowable solvents among the changes and

3885
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:54,210
I'm gonna read off some of the changes

3886
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:56,039
they list here the legal threshold for

3887
02:51:54,209 --> 02:51:58,139
butane the solvent that puts the B and

3888
02:51:56,040 --> 02:52:00,740
BHO will increase more than six-fold

3889
02:51:58,139 --> 02:52:03,689
from a hundred parts per million to

3890
02:52:00,739 --> 02:52:05,069
5,000 parts per million

3891
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:08,790
I should slow down and kind of explain

3892
02:52:05,069 --> 02:52:11,550
what that means um so PPA means parts

3893
02:52:08,790 --> 02:52:12,990
per million that means that parts per

3894
02:52:11,550 --> 02:52:14,399
million right that there are so if there

3895
02:52:12,989 --> 02:52:16,530
are a million parts in there you were

3896
02:52:14,399 --> 02:52:18,479
allowed to have 800 parts of butane in

3897
02:52:16,530 --> 02:52:19,860
there before out of a million which is

3898
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:21,209
in law you probably wouldn't notice that

3899
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:22,801
right if I gave you a million something

3900
02:52:21,209 --> 02:52:23,789
and told you pick me at 800 of them and

3901
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:26,069
give them to me you wouldn't notice

3902
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:29,341
you're missing no now you're allowed to

3903
02:52:26,069 --> 02:52:30,750
have 5000 which may start making a

3904
02:52:29,341 --> 02:52:34,470
little bit of a difference you may show

3905
02:52:30,750 --> 02:52:37,380
that up 5000 ppm of residual solvents of

3906
02:52:34,470 --> 02:52:38,770
butane feels like a whole lot of butane

3907
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:41,879
to me

3908
02:52:38,771 --> 02:52:45,700
it's a larger number but without

3909
02:52:41,879 --> 02:52:48,489
significantly more context it's not

3910
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:52,329
helpful information I know for a fact

3911
02:52:48,489 --> 02:52:55,720
that given the boiling points I mean

3912
02:52:52,329 --> 02:52:57,970
even like really really really really

3913
02:52:55,720 --> 02:53:00,369
high amounts of butane left and final

3914
02:52:57,970 --> 02:53:04,479
product all of that cooks off long

3915
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:06,010
before dabbed a face right it comes off

3916
02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:08,379
at the nail if you're getting that much

3917
02:53:06,010 --> 02:53:09,970
yeah if there's anything if there's much

3918
02:53:08,379 --> 02:53:11,799
of anything left over in the product

3919
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:17,049
it's gone on the nail long before the

3920
02:53:11,799 --> 02:53:19,060
dad gets to you okay with butane

3921
02:53:17,049 --> 02:53:21,100
but if you if it was harmful they

3922
02:53:19,060 --> 02:53:22,090
wouldn't be making these changes we

3923
02:53:21,101 --> 02:53:23,980
don't I don't think we have enough

3924
02:53:22,090 --> 02:53:27,670
information yet to know how harmful

3925
02:53:23,979 --> 02:53:30,039
smoking a concentrate made from butane

3926
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:32,440
could be and that's from and I'm at a

3927
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:35,440
heavy BHO advocate I probably spoke more

3928
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:37,181
BHO percent of the world most of the

3929
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:39,370
health rules that they haven't been able

3930
02:53:37,181 --> 02:53:40,780
to research specifically for cannabis

3931
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:43,660
they have already researched

3932
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:45,489
specifically for similar items true we

3933
02:53:43,659 --> 02:53:48,431
know a lot about pesticide residual

3934
02:53:45,489 --> 02:53:49,780
limits because of the tobacco industry

3935
02:53:48,431 --> 02:53:54,159
there's already something that's mass

3936
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:55,510
produced that's smoked we know as a ppm

3937
02:53:54,159 --> 02:53:58,360
limits from some other things for I can

3938
02:53:55,510 --> 02:54:00,280
hailed medicines the article because it

3939
02:53:58,360 --> 02:54:01,650
mentions stuff like that I've pre-read I

3940
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:04,271
did some research

3941
02:54:01,649 --> 02:54:05,949
another rule allowed residuals for

3942
02:54:04,271 --> 02:54:08,010
heptanes and other class of solvents

3943
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:10,300
will go up by a factor of 10

3944
02:54:08,010 --> 02:54:11,829
xylene industrial solvents that

3945
02:54:10,299 --> 02:54:14,049
technically aren't allowed to be used

3946
02:54:11,829 --> 02:54:15,970
for cannabis extraction at all will be

3947
02:54:14,049 --> 02:54:19,649
permitted at concentrations of up to

3948
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:21,459
2,000 170 particles per million

3949
02:54:19,649 --> 02:54:25,390
significantly higher than the premium

3950
02:54:21,459 --> 02:54:27,579
previous limit of 1 a ppm the state

3951
02:54:25,390 --> 02:54:29,229
residual limit on benzene perhaps the

3952
02:54:27,579 --> 02:54:33,521
most hazardous chemical of the group

3953
02:54:29,229 --> 02:54:36,609
will double from less than 1 ppm to less

3954
02:54:33,521 --> 02:54:37,900
than 2 ppm there's a little article here

3955
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:40,150
that gives you a graph that is way too

3956
02:54:37,899 --> 02:54:43,239
small to read well I mean and that's a

3957
02:54:40,149 --> 02:54:45,489
good example of how statistics it's

3958
02:54:43,239 --> 02:54:48,819
gonna more than double from less than 1

3959
02:54:45,489 --> 02:54:50,560
to almost 2 to almost 2 like depending

3960
02:54:48,819 --> 02:54:51,649
on how always read the 5 dangerous those

3961
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:52,579
chemicals are that can

3962
02:54:51,649 --> 02:54:53,810
make a difference and there's something

3963
02:54:52,579 --> 02:54:55,909
I want to talk about once we get rid of

3964
02:54:53,810 --> 02:54:57,529
the work done through the article I goes

3965
02:54:55,909 --> 02:54:59,390
on to say on the surface these are

3966
02:54:57,530 --> 02:55:00,860
staggering increases in chemicals that

3967
02:54:59,390 --> 02:55:02,810
at some levels have been associated with

3968
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:05,801
nausea irregular heartbeat increased

3969
02:55:02,810 --> 02:55:07,940
risk of cancer and even death regulators

3970
02:55:05,800 --> 02:55:09,649
testing laboratory operators and

3971
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:11,870
industry members in other states have

3972
02:55:09,649 --> 02:55:14,511
expressed surprises if the changes which

3973
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:16,641
will apply to both adult use and medical

3974
02:55:14,511 --> 02:55:19,250
markets mike van Dijk chief of the

3975

health and toxicology branch at the

3977
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:24,530
Colorado Department of Public Health and

3978
02:55:22,341 --> 02:55:26,750
Environment will recommend the new limit

3979
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:28,551
acknowledge that which recommended the

3980
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:29,959
new limit acknowledge the concentrate

3981
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:31,819
it's capable of clearing the regulatory

3982
02:55:29,959 --> 02:55:34,399
hurdles could be noticeably different

3983
02:55:31,819 --> 02:55:37,130
from what's currently allowed consumers

3984
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:39,229
are going to feel like they may taste it

3985
02:55:37,130 --> 02:55:41,930
he said of these new allowed butane

3986
02:55:39,229 --> 02:55:43,399
levels they might smell it I'm surprised

3987
02:55:41,931 --> 02:55:44,841
nobody else has even actually been

3988
02:55:43,399 --> 02:55:48,079
interested in this he told me in an

3989
02:55:44,841 --> 02:55:50,120
interview just last week the guys making

3990
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:52,700
these rules are saying that we are going

3991
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:56,960
to taste and smell butane in our

3992
02:55:52,700 --> 02:55:58,730
concentrates with these I don't know

3993
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:00,259
enough about how much butane that is to

3994
02:55:58,729 --> 02:56:02,389
know

3995
02:56:00,260 --> 02:56:04,609
just pert just when you break you down

3996
02:56:02,389 --> 02:56:08,079
for per million when you I mean if that

3997
02:56:04,609 --> 02:56:10,520
whole grandma hash is 1 million pieces

3998
02:56:08,079 --> 02:56:15,079
the five thousand that you're talking

3999
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:17,420
about aren't visible like they're not

4000
02:56:15,079 --> 02:56:19,370
visibly visually identifiable as

4001
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:20,960
separate able from the whole like we're

4002
02:56:19,370 --> 02:56:24,109
talking about an incredibly small amount

4003
02:56:20,959 --> 02:56:26,419
here it does surprise me that this

4004
02:56:24,109 --> 02:56:30,979
didn't make the press because it does

4005
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:32,989
increase a residual solvents as there's

4006
02:56:30,978 --> 02:56:35,059
no other way to sound to say that to

4007
02:56:32,989 --> 02:56:38,898
make it sound better or worse I don't

4008
02:56:35,059 --> 02:56:41,239
think it seems like something that would

4009
02:56:38,898 --> 02:56:42,799
make the press but it was only reported

4010
02:56:41,239 --> 02:56:45,199
almost nowhere the only reason I know

4011
02:56:42,799 --> 02:56:47,449
about this rule change is because of the

4012
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:57,890
labeling rules that came along with oh

4013
02:56:47,450 --> 02:56:59,600
yeah let me continue with the article I

4014
02:56:57,889 --> 02:57:01,430
goes on to say there are a few things

4015
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,260
Colorado Department of Public Health and

4016
02:57:01,430 --> 02:57:05,389
Environment VanDyke wants to make clear

4017
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:07,370
about the new rules here is one this

4018
02:57:05,389 --> 02:57:09,469
change was not a result of any industry

4019
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:11,810
pressure the increased didn't come at

4020
02:57:09,469 --> 02:57:13,099
the behest what's that word mean the

4021
02:57:11,809 --> 02:57:19,309
behest I know the word means I've never

4022
02:57:13,100 --> 02:57:20,689
read that we requested the increase did

4023
02:57:19,309 --> 02:57:22,489
not come at the behest of lobbyists he

4024
02:57:20,689 --> 02:57:24,529
told Leafly in fact in the work groups

4025
02:57:22,489 --> 02:57:26,840
if we heard anything from the industry I

4026
02:57:24,529 --> 02:57:28,399
think we heard the other side that these

4027
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:31,370
were too high he said which is an

4028
02:57:28,398 --> 02:57:32,869
uncommon place to be so what's going on

4029
02:57:31,370 --> 02:57:34,550
the justification for the change

4030
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:36,439
according to Van Dyke is that the new

4031
02:57:34,549 --> 02:57:38,329
limits truly follow the best currently

4032
02:57:36,439 --> 02:57:41,180
available medical and scientific

4033
02:57:38,329 --> 02:57:42,799
guidance this was really a today staaan

4034
02:57:41,180 --> 02:57:44,750
trying to make things health based he

4035
02:57:42,799 --> 02:57:47,420
explained these numbers come from the

4036
02:57:44,750 --> 02:57:49,489
international harmonized guidelines for

4037
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:51,978
residual solvents and pharmaceuticals

4038
02:57:49,489 --> 02:57:54,260
van Dijk is referring to a published

4039
02:57:51,978 --> 02:57:56,869
scientific article he cited in a July

4040
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:58,159
letter to Jim Barack director of the

4041
02:57:56,870 --> 02:57:59,810
Colorado Department of Revenue's

4042
02:57:58,159 --> 02:58:02,478
Enforcement Division which is in charge

4043
02:57:59,809 --> 02:58:04,219
of enforcing the new standards and I

4044
02:58:02,478 --> 02:58:06,949
provided the letter and spoke at length

4045
02:58:04,219 --> 02:58:08,659
to Leafly about the coming change while

4046
02:58:06,950 --> 02:58:10,460
these numbers stand the test of time I

4047
02:58:08,659 --> 02:58:12,590
don't know he said we're open to new

4048
02:58:10,459 --> 02:58:14,119
data that comes out but our goal is to

4049
02:58:12,590 --> 02:58:16,100
make sure that we maintain the

4050
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:19,420
we can the best evidence they

4051
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:21,800
evidence-based regulations for health

4052
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:23,930
agencies trying to do precisely what has

4053
02:58:21,799 --> 02:58:26,539
been asked Van Dyke said legislation

4054
02:58:23,930 --> 02:58:29,750
passed this year Ben is list the House

4055
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:30,890
bill 16-12 61 put the Colorado

4056
02:58:29,750 --> 02:58:32,359
Department of Public Health and

4057
02:58:30,889 --> 02:58:34,369
Environment in charge of recommending

4058
02:58:32,359 --> 02:58:36,170
testing standards based on medical

4059
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:38,329
reports and published scientific

4060
02:58:36,170 --> 02:58:40,398
literature but the Colorado Department

4061
02:58:38,329 --> 02:58:42,709
of Revenue's said the previous limits in

4062
02:58:40,398 --> 02:58:45,228
the wake of amendment 64 s passage it

4063
02:58:42,709 --> 02:58:47,089
was a fast and furious process Van Dyke

4064
02:58:45,228 --> 02:58:48,559
said there were times you came up with

4065
02:58:47,090 --> 02:58:49,460
numbers because that's what you came up

4066
02:58:48,559 --> 02:58:51,379
with at the time

4067
02:58:49,459 --> 02:58:53,929
despite the eye-popping increases he

4068
02:58:51,379 --> 02:58:55,688
said new limits adhere more strictly to

4069
02:58:53,930 --> 02:59:00,260
the latest available evidence in

4070
02:58:55,689 --> 02:59:01,550
scientific research there's a lot more

4071
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:03,789
to this I'm gonna skim it roll it go

4072
02:59:01,549 --> 02:59:07,208
ahead Mike fat

4073
02:59:03,789 --> 02:59:09,699
that model of we picked a number and we

4074
02:59:07,209 --> 02:59:11,649
kind of pulled it out of our ass but we

4075
02:59:09,699 --> 02:59:15,189
we just went with them the much more

4076
02:59:11,648 --> 02:59:18,398
restrictive sounding rule to start off

4077
02:59:15,189 --> 02:59:20,619
with and now we're dialing it back to

4078
02:59:18,398 --> 02:59:22,448
more in line with reality I think we're

4079
02:59:20,619 --> 02:59:25,509
gonna see that in a lot of different

4080
02:59:22,449 --> 02:59:27,578
areas of regulation in Colorado we're

4081
02:59:25,509 --> 02:59:30,218
realizing that in a lot of ways we way

4082
02:59:27,578 --> 02:59:33,418
overdid it in some areas right I mean it

4083
02:59:30,218 --> 02:59:35,678
doesn't surprise me that this is one I

4084
02:59:33,418 --> 02:59:39,418
wouldn't be surprised in the next two

4085
02:59:35,679 --> 02:59:43,328
years to see a lot of different testing

4086
02:59:39,418 --> 02:59:46,359
rules and regulations tweaked up and

4087
02:59:43,328 --> 02:59:48,998
down as we learn more and we finally get

4088
02:59:46,359 --> 02:59:50,738
around to checking the research our

4089
02:59:48,998 --> 02:59:53,918
driving limit for example the five

4090
02:59:50,738 --> 02:59:56,378
nanograms that's just a rule another

4091
02:59:53,918 --> 02:59:59,048
state had in place and they just pulled

4092
02:59:56,379 --> 03:00:01,179
it out of their ass there's no research

4093
02:59:59,049 --> 03:00:02,919
at all to tie it with that but we made

4094
03:00:01,179 --> 03:00:04,449
that part of our law here I wouldn't be

4095
03:00:02,918 --> 03:00:08,318
allowed near a car five nanograms

4096
03:00:04,449 --> 03:00:10,959
there's a real thing I tried to have my

4097
03:00:08,318 --> 03:00:13,448
primary care physician run two tests on

4098
03:00:10,959 --> 03:00:15,879
me after not smoking like all night and

4099
03:00:13,449 --> 03:00:18,549
then going in the morning and she didn't

4100
03:00:15,879 --> 03:00:20,709
know which tests to run and so I had to

4101
03:00:18,549 --> 03:00:22,509
run three different THC tests and all of

4102
03:00:20,709 --> 03:00:27,969
them I was whatever the test result came

4103
03:00:22,509 --> 03:00:29,588
back I was way above five but that we're

4104
03:00:27,968 --> 03:00:31,358
doing that research now that research

4105
03:00:29,588 --> 03:00:33,668
just got flooded in Colorado so in two

4106
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:36,309
years three years we'll have more

4107
03:00:33,668 --> 03:00:37,388
information to change that rule and I

4108
03:00:36,308 --> 03:00:38,798
think that's gonna happen in a lot of

4109
03:00:37,388 --> 03:00:41,228
places it doesn't surprise me that's

4110
03:00:38,799 --> 03:00:42,639
happening here with ppm limits well the

4111
03:00:41,228 --> 03:00:44,858
article keeps going and the guy says

4112
03:00:42,638 --> 03:00:47,168
actually frankly he doesn't actually he

4113
03:00:44,859 --> 03:00:48,789
actually says frankly we're not saying

4114
03:00:47,168 --> 03:00:51,638
that extracted marijuana products should

4115
03:00:48,789 --> 03:00:53,770
have 5000 PPM's of butane in them in

4116
03:00:51,638 --> 03:00:55,778
Colorado he said what we're saying is

4117
03:00:53,770 --> 03:00:57,819
five thousand is a health-based limit

4118
03:00:55,779 --> 03:00:59,439
but he then it goes on sorry I'm reading

4119
03:00:57,818 --> 03:01:01,208
way too fast but didn't he just

4120
03:00:59,439 --> 03:01:03,520
acknowledge the possibility of literally

4121
03:01:01,209 --> 03:01:05,529
smelling butane and the BHO approved by

4122
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:07,599
the state for medical patients I think

4123
03:01:05,529 --> 03:01:09,309
there may be a lot of market drivers

4124
03:01:07,599 --> 03:01:11,588
that push those numbers lower if an Tyco

4125
03:01:09,308 --> 03:01:13,778
acknowledged and smell could certainly

4126
03:01:11,588 --> 03:01:15,780
be one of them but he repeated it's not

4127
03:01:13,779 --> 03:01:17,970
from a health perspective that those

4128
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:20,370
should be lower but there are residual

4129
03:01:17,970 --> 03:01:22,379
solvents but our residual solvents

4130
03:01:20,370 --> 03:01:24,480
merely a matter of product taste and

4131
03:01:22,379 --> 03:01:26,640
quality or as scientific research still

4132
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:29,129
too limited to inspire a consumer

4133
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:32,011
confidence it may be a little bit of

4134
03:01:29,129 --> 03:01:35,670
both that's what I'm gonna jump in right

4135
03:01:32,011 --> 03:01:37,829
now because even if we're allowed to put

4136
03:01:35,670 --> 03:01:40,069
5,000 particles per minute to leave that

4137
03:01:37,829 --> 03:01:42,840
in there and not purge it out properly

4138
03:01:40,069 --> 03:01:44,789
most consumers are educated enough to go

4139
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:46,799
I don't want that [ __ ] and they would go

4140
03:01:44,790 --> 03:01:49,021
buy so I've got two different products

4141
03:01:46,799 --> 03:01:53,189
of shatter on my table right now one was

4142
03:01:49,021 --> 03:01:54,690
a gift one will probably remain on this

4143
03:01:53,190 --> 03:01:56,579
piece of parchment paper until the end

4144
03:01:54,690 --> 03:01:59,460
of [ __ ] time is I do not want to dab

4145
03:01:56,579 --> 03:02:01,229
it the other however was made by an

4146
03:01:59,459 --> 03:02:04,169
artist who took their time and their

4147
03:02:01,229 --> 03:02:06,270
energy if you went to the dispensary

4148
03:02:04,170 --> 03:02:09,030
Mike and this dark stuff that looks like

4149
03:02:06,271 --> 03:02:11,790
squirrel poop was here available for you

4150
03:02:09,030 --> 03:02:15,811
for $25 a grand plus tax it looks like a

4151
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:29,340
piece onyx it is pretty damn dark or

4152
03:02:15,810 --> 03:02:32,699
this golden kind of gold would you grab

4153
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:34,739
all this if this was at the store would

4154
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:37,230
you even buy it though see so you're an

4155
03:02:34,739 --> 03:02:39,090
educated consumer even know that a lot

4156
03:02:37,229 --> 03:02:40,970
of times you get that dark color just

4157
03:02:39,090 --> 03:02:44,250
because the material wasn't processed

4158
03:02:40,970 --> 03:02:46,109
quickly enough and it had time to age a

4159
03:02:44,250 --> 03:02:47,909
little bit before I got processed this

4160
03:02:46,110 --> 03:02:49,681
isn't I believe that that hash and if

4161
03:02:47,909 --> 03:02:53,181
you're listening to my podcast my friend

4162
03:02:49,681 --> 03:02:53,181
that makes this hash you may listen I

4163
03:02:53,329 --> 03:02:57,539
didn't want to mention this I think

4164
03:02:55,649 --> 03:02:59,789
what's happening is if you were using a

4165
03:02:57,540 --> 03:03:02,670
closed loop system the material is

4166
03:02:59,790 --> 03:03:04,950
sitting in the butane far too long he

4167
03:03:02,670 --> 03:03:07,290
was talking about this was his record

4168
03:03:04,950 --> 03:03:09,120
pool how they got more hash from the

4169
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:10,771
amount of Tyrael than the amount of

4170
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:12,000
material than they've ever pulled before

4171
03:03:10,771 --> 03:03:13,590
it's because you pulled out a bunch of

4172
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:15,319
chlorophyll my friend that's why the

4173
03:03:13,590 --> 03:03:17,940
hash has got this dark greenish color

4174
03:03:15,319 --> 03:03:20,520
yes there's a lot of THC here but you

4175
03:03:17,940 --> 03:03:21,750
lowered your THC quantity by pulling

4176
03:03:20,521 --> 03:03:24,061
more chlorophyll you increased your

4177
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:25,379
weight but you lowered your potency so

4178
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:27,511
if you're doing it in a closed-loop

4179
03:03:25,379 --> 03:03:28,909
system a little quicker about it don't

4180
03:03:27,511 --> 03:03:31,340
leave it soaking on a soak

4181
03:03:28,909 --> 03:03:33,200
along its the hash version of putting a

4182
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:35,870
coin in your grandeur it may be time to

4183
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:37,521
clean the butane and the machine also if

4184
03:03:35,870 --> 03:03:39,680
you're doing this if this hash was made

4185
03:03:37,521 --> 03:03:41,989
open blasted what you did was you ran

4186
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:44,420
too many cans you needed to stop a can

4187
03:03:41,989 --> 03:03:47,060
before because you're pushing it through

4188
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:49,190
the tube you're pushing it's going pay

4189
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:50,569
attention it should run piss clear it

4190
03:03:49,190 --> 03:03:52,220
should look like well hydrated peat

4191
03:03:50,569 --> 03:03:55,159
should be clear coming out of there as

4192
03:03:52,219 --> 03:03:58,279
soon as you see it coming dark through

4193
03:03:55,159 --> 03:04:00,890
it I will go as far as to move my can

4194
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:02,420
over the grass or over the cement and

4195
03:04:00,890 --> 03:04:04,699
just drip it right into there and quit

4196
03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:06,950
putting it into my catch door people do

4197
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:09,021
too bad when I open up when I open blast

4198
03:04:06,950 --> 03:04:11,030
into a open container I do it into a

4199
03:04:09,021 --> 03:04:21,290
mason jar because it's got a smaller

4200
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:22,790
opening with less prevents you from

4201
03:04:21,290 --> 03:04:25,820
getting contaminants into it if you do

4202
03:04:22,790 --> 03:04:27,230
it into a big flat pyrex dish leaves and

4203
03:04:25,819 --> 03:04:28,610
shoot from the trees fall in you got to

4204
03:04:27,229 --> 03:04:30,859
do it outside bugs flying to their

4205
03:04:28,610 --> 03:04:40,370
[ __ ] butterfly landing the pancake

4206
03:04:30,860 --> 03:04:41,659
tray or the cookie tray don't make any

4207
03:04:40,370 --> 03:04:45,021
more that's why I feel free talking

4208
03:04:41,659 --> 03:04:47,090
about it it's you've been working with

4209
03:04:45,021 --> 03:04:49,670
with butane like that there's safety

4210
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:51,460
precautions that oh it's just one way

4211
03:04:49,670 --> 03:04:54,351
our community keeps [ __ ] ourselves

4212
03:04:51,459 --> 03:04:55,789
every time I some idiot blows up their

4213
03:04:54,351 --> 03:04:59,450
apartment of their house trying to make

4214
03:04:55,790 --> 03:05:02,320
dabs in the backyard like just leave it

4215
03:04:59,450 --> 03:05:04,790
to the [ __ ] professionals true I

4216
03:05:02,319 --> 03:05:06,199
remember reading in history class about

4217
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:07,700
bathtub gin and people blowing

4218
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:09,771
themselves up trying to meet you in the

4219
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:12,409
bathtub and I've thought how dumb were

4220
03:05:09,771 --> 03:05:14,210
people back then and then Here I am 35

4221
03:05:12,409 --> 03:05:14,629
and my contemporaries are doing the

4222
03:05:14,209 --> 03:05:16,520
execs

4223
03:05:14,629 --> 03:05:19,310
there were freaking hands there weren't

4224
03:05:16,521 --> 03:05:21,800
professionals six years ago back then

4225
03:05:19,310 --> 03:05:24,469
the professionals were us you know what

4226
03:05:21,799 --> 03:05:26,270
I mean like Big D was a professional

4227
03:05:24,469 --> 03:05:29,000
back then and he was doing it with a

4228
03:05:26,271 --> 03:05:30,771
[ __ ] until three years ago he was

4229
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:32,450
doing it in a tube in a parking lot at a

4230
03:05:30,771 --> 03:05:33,980
professional business with a license

4231
03:05:32,450 --> 03:05:34,250
that's how it well they were okay with

4232
03:05:33,979 --> 03:05:36,529
that

4233
03:05:34,250 --> 03:05:38,659
ya know you gotta have a [ __ ]

4234
03:05:36,530 --> 03:05:40,210
blast-proof building and all kinds of

4235
03:05:38,659 --> 03:05:41,978
fire equipment

4236
03:05:40,209 --> 03:05:44,919
soups and all training and hazmat

4237
03:05:41,978 --> 03:05:46,959
material it's a way different world now

4238
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:49,200
so what those professionals do it and I

4239
03:05:46,959 --> 03:05:52,569
think that if we legalize cannabis

4240
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:54,550
everywhere well know it's definitely a

4241
03:05:52,569 --> 03:05:56,228
legalization in the market yeah because

4242
03:05:54,549 --> 03:06:01,299
because then if a lot of the places

4243
03:05:56,228 --> 03:06:03,699
where the the frequent BHO home cook

4244
03:06:01,299 --> 03:06:05,769
blow ups are happening are in

4245
03:06:03,700 --> 03:06:09,720
legalization states where it's sixty

4246
03:06:05,770 --> 03:06:09,720
five seventy five a gram on the shelf or

4247
03:06:09,809 --> 03:06:14,289
where there is no option and in places

4248
03:06:12,610 --> 03:06:15,850
where there's there's no legal accident

4249
03:06:14,290 --> 03:06:17,229
you gotta if you have to grow your own

4250
03:06:15,850 --> 03:06:19,300
and make your own you [ __ ] will

4251
03:06:17,228 --> 03:06:20,769
because people want to get high they're

4252
03:06:19,299 --> 03:06:22,449
going to do what they have to to get

4253
03:06:20,770 --> 03:06:24,190
high to get medicated they're gonna do

4254
03:06:22,450 --> 03:06:26,409
that if it's not available they're gonna

4255
03:06:24,190 --> 03:06:27,819
figure out a way since they just grew

4256
03:06:26,409 --> 03:06:29,350
some shitty weed because they can't get

4257
03:06:27,819 --> 03:06:30,670
the products to a proper weed now they

4258
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:31,870
got to do something with it so let's

4259
03:06:30,670 --> 03:06:33,040
just go get some butane we're gonna

4260
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:36,610
threw some cans and blow up the house

4261
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:38,740
and make this look even worse is the

4262
03:06:36,610 --> 03:06:41,890
more likely you are to screw up the

4263
03:06:38,739 --> 03:06:42,909
safety precautions if it's just legal

4264
03:06:41,889 --> 03:06:44,889
then you can just go to the store and

4265
03:06:42,909 --> 03:06:50,200
get it on the shelf in Colorado you can

4266
03:06:44,889 --> 03:06:59,349
go I can think of four places for 20 25

4267
03:06:50,200 --> 03:07:00,640
35 a gram a good fire shatter the

4268
03:06:59,350 --> 03:07:01,690
article but I'm gonna keep reading it

4269
03:07:00,639 --> 03:07:04,000
anyway just because it feels like

4270
03:07:01,690 --> 03:07:05,590
there's more it says a knowledge problem

4271
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:07,299
a lot of eyes widened when I talk to

4272
03:07:05,590 --> 03:07:09,190
people who weren't aware of Colorado's

4273
03:07:07,299 --> 03:07:10,869
new standards some consumers believe

4274
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:12,340
that industrial solvents are inherently

4275
03:07:10,870 --> 03:07:14,890
hazardous to their health and should be

4276
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:16,450
avoided at virtually any level many

4277
03:07:14,889 --> 03:07:18,489
concentrate consumers now opt for

4278
03:07:16,450 --> 03:07:20,650
solvent las' extract such as rosin or

4279
03:07:18,489 --> 03:07:23,049
bubble hash others don't worry as much

4280
03:07:20,649 --> 03:07:24,670
pointing out ah dennis is accurately

4281
03:07:23,049 --> 03:07:26,500
according to most scientists i talked to

4282
03:07:24,670 --> 03:07:28,420
that someone who smells a whiff of

4283
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:31,239
butane from a Bic lighter has already

4284
03:07:28,420 --> 03:07:34,478
inhaled way more than they'll get in a

4285
03:07:31,239 --> 03:07:36,399
day of dabbing that's a great a great

4286
03:07:34,478 --> 03:07:38,228
comparison I like that well he's sitting

4287
03:07:36,399 --> 03:07:40,690
there talking about tasting it what in

4288
03:07:38,228 --> 03:07:42,250
the hash to 5000 ppm and I'm sitting

4289
03:07:40,690 --> 03:07:44,890
there thinking about refilling my torch

4290
03:07:42,250 --> 03:07:46,239
and when your torch gets phone you get

4291
03:07:44,889 --> 03:07:48,399
that little bit out that should I

4292
03:07:46,239 --> 03:07:51,159
guarantee you guru

4293
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:53,319
more than 5000 ppm a butane in the air

4294
03:07:51,159 --> 03:07:55,810
around your head yeah in that moment as

4295
03:07:53,319 --> 03:07:57,729
it's it's blasted out excess I mean it

4296
03:07:55,810 --> 03:08:01,119
I'm sure it dissipates quickly but I

4297
03:07:57,729 --> 03:08:04,091
don't taste butane then and I haven't

4298
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:05,980
just forced that through a several

4299
03:08:04,091 --> 03:08:09,851
hundred agree now right I agree with

4300
03:08:05,979 --> 03:08:11,439
that there's this guy this guy goes on

4301
03:08:09,851 --> 03:08:13,450
to say it's not the butane said Nick

4302
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:15,610
Mosely co-owner and chief science

4303
03:08:13,450 --> 03:08:18,011
officer at confident confidence

4304
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:20,261
analytics a kind of assessing laboratory

4305
03:08:18,011 --> 03:08:22,360
in Washington State the butane is really

4306
03:08:20,261 --> 03:08:24,909
not a huge health risk he said adding

4307
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:26,650
that it takes quite a bit way more than

4308
03:08:24,909 --> 03:08:28,780
you get from dabbing or a vape in to

4309
03:08:26,649 --> 03:08:32,529
cause serious harm such as liver damage

4310
03:08:28,780 --> 03:08:34,271
and then there is a 1991 1981 case study

4311
03:08:32,530 --> 03:08:36,790
cited by the US Department of Health and

4312
03:08:34,271 --> 03:08:39,700
Human Services found that exposure to

4313
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:41,410
10,000 ppm s for 10 minutes may lead to

4314
03:08:39,700 --> 03:08:44,200
drowsiness but doesn't appear to cause

4315
03:08:41,409 --> 03:08:47,681
systemic effects in humans the average

4316
03:08:44,200 --> 03:08:51,011
dab consists of about 10 milligrams to

4317
03:08:47,681 --> 03:08:53,649
20 milligrams of concentrate mostly at

4318
03:08:51,011 --> 03:08:56,170
confidence analytic set and in the eyes

4319
03:08:53,649 --> 03:08:58,600
of Colorado regulators he added there

4320
03:08:56,170 --> 03:09:01,390
these class three solvents are not cause

4321
03:08:58,601 --> 03:09:04,960
for concern at 5000 ppm s when the dose

4322
03:09:01,390 --> 03:09:06,789
of the substance is so low then they go

4323
03:09:04,959 --> 03:09:08,529
on to say Mosely did call the levels of

4324
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:10,750
xylenes and benzene and Colorado

4325
03:09:08,530 --> 03:09:13,091
concerning the issue with xylenes and

4326
03:09:10,750 --> 03:09:15,250
benzene he explained is that the

4327
03:09:13,091 --> 03:09:17,290
contaminants are unintentionally there

4328
03:09:15,250 --> 03:09:19,000
in other words those chemicals aren't

4329
03:09:17,290 --> 03:09:20,801
part of the extraction process those

4330
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,351
chemicals are sometimes used to clean

4331
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:24,880
equipment and may inadvertently become

4332
03:09:23,351 --> 03:09:26,620
part of the final product

4333
03:09:24,880 --> 03:09:28,930
see that's [ __ ] that sucks I don't like

4334
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:31,150
that they're also sometimes found in

4335
03:09:28,931 --> 03:09:33,101
low-quality solvents okay so if you

4336
03:09:31,149 --> 03:09:34,539
don't distill your butane properly in

4337
03:09:33,101 --> 03:09:37,181
other words their contaminants in the

4338
03:09:34,540 --> 03:09:39,431
contaminant Mosley wasn't there

4339
03:09:37,181 --> 03:09:41,230
contaminants in the contaminate Mosley

4340
03:09:39,431 --> 03:09:42,700
wasn't trying to consider to criticize

4341
03:09:41,229 --> 03:09:44,199
Colorado's new limits from a health

4342
03:09:42,700 --> 03:09:46,360
perspective though he didn't sound

4343
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:48,070
especially jazzed about the idea of

4344
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:50,319
finding those residual levels in a

4345
03:09:48,069 --> 03:09:52,390
concentrator he just meant that it

4346
03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:54,011
higher but soon to be a legal level of

4347
03:09:52,390 --> 03:09:55,989
residuals could indicate careless

4348
03:09:54,011 --> 03:09:58,210
extraction methods or low quality

4349
03:09:55,989 --> 03:10:00,219
products and see that's what a lot of

4350
03:09:58,209 --> 03:10:03,099
people's concern is going to be

4351
03:10:00,219 --> 03:10:04,750
this is gonna make extractors lazy oh I

4352
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:06,430
don't have to take all this out let's

4353
03:10:04,750 --> 03:10:08,109
hurry up and get this out of the back of

4354
03:10:06,430 --> 03:10:09,850
it so we can get the next batch in the

4355
03:10:08,109 --> 03:10:11,350
back oven because this is gonna pass lab

4356
03:10:09,850 --> 03:10:12,880
tests this is gonna be able to go on the

4357
03:10:11,350 --> 03:10:16,030
shelves

4358
03:10:12,879 --> 03:10:17,920
the limits were drastically increased

4359
03:10:16,030 --> 03:10:21,521
but they were so drastically increased

4360
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:24,940
to a number so small that it's

4361
03:10:21,521 --> 03:10:26,771
unnoticeable it's it's a super tiny

4362
03:10:24,940 --> 03:10:28,390
amount and when you think about all the

4363
03:10:26,771 --> 03:10:31,391
other testing and stuff that goes into

4364
03:10:28,390 --> 03:10:33,940
it this is a conversation we're only

4365
03:10:31,390 --> 03:10:40,709
able to have because it's insanely legal

4366
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:43,630
here statewide we have access to product

4367
03:10:40,709 --> 03:10:47,350
unmatched anywhere in the US as far as

4368
03:10:43,629 --> 03:10:48,970
testing in labeling goes we know more

4369
03:10:47,351 --> 03:10:53,319
about the product we're consuming than

4370
03:10:48,970 --> 03:10:55,090
anyone on the planet and going through

4371
03:10:53,319 --> 03:10:57,101
these rulemaking hearings as part of

4372
03:10:55,090 --> 03:10:59,860
that like these are the limits for

4373
03:10:57,101 --> 03:11:03,400
anything else on the market I'm not

4374
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:05,200
encouraging it extractors to push the

4375
03:11:03,399 --> 03:11:09,279
envelope of the upper limits that are

4376
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:11,079
allowed now but if if these are allowed

4377
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:14,320
for any other product that buy in a

4378
03:11:11,079 --> 03:11:16,920
store or a pharmacy I don't see why they

4379
03:11:14,319 --> 03:11:19,779
shouldn't be that's my my hash either

4380
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:24,340
but I also understand the movement away

4381
03:11:19,780 --> 03:11:25,840
from solvent solvent made hash I get the

4382
03:11:24,340 --> 03:11:30,040
people that are looking for high grade

4383
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:32,290
water extract a lot of people are Moz

4384
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:36,700
entrain yeah a lot of people love rosin

4385
03:11:32,290 --> 03:11:39,910
a lot of people are haters of BHO I get

4386
03:11:36,700 --> 03:11:44,620
it a big part of the marijuana community

4387
03:11:39,909 --> 03:11:46,590
came here fleeing the pharmaceutical

4388
03:11:44,620 --> 03:11:51,630
industry for one reason or another and

4389
03:11:46,590 --> 03:11:55,931
the idea of their marijuana industry

4390
03:11:51,629 --> 03:12:00,939
moving towards that model in any way is

4391
03:11:55,931 --> 03:12:05,110
scary moving away from natural in any

4392
03:12:00,940 --> 03:12:08,319
way is scary to them I hate to be the

4393
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:10,989
one to point out that their flowers and

4394
03:12:08,319 --> 03:12:16,000
that the BHO hash are almost identical

4395
03:12:10,989 --> 03:12:19,690
in every way except for a little bit of

4396
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:21,340
solvent used in the extract everything

4397
03:12:19,690 --> 03:12:24,569
that's in that flower is gonna be in

4398
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:26,489
that extract including all the bats

4399
03:12:24,569 --> 03:12:28,079
in your flower because just because it's

4400
03:12:26,489 --> 03:12:31,229
a plant doesn't mean it's good for you

4401
03:12:28,079 --> 03:12:32,579
or natural in the end for a little bit a

4402
03:12:31,229 --> 03:12:35,369
lot of people were under the impression

4403
03:12:32,579 --> 03:12:38,190
that the clear and distillate was

4404
03:12:35,370 --> 03:12:40,860
removing solvents but we have recently

4405
03:12:38,190 --> 03:12:42,960
discovered that that is not true no you

4406
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:45,900
have to use a separate filter to get out

4407
03:12:42,959 --> 03:12:47,189
pesticides and solvents from the clay

4408
03:12:45,899 --> 03:12:48,389
it's getting rid of the solvents because

4409
03:12:47,190 --> 03:12:50,010
we're heating it high enough that it's

4410
03:12:48,389 --> 03:12:51,389
the pesticides that we're not getting

4411
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:52,950
out I said that wrong probably because I

4412
03:12:51,389 --> 03:12:57,029
took too many dads there were a lot of

4413
03:12:52,950 --> 03:12:59,820
rumors about the clear and 99% of them

4414
03:12:57,030 --> 03:13:02,220
were were just [ __ ] but I do love

4415
03:12:59,819 --> 03:13:06,149
some well-made distillate oh my god I've

4416
03:13:02,219 --> 03:13:07,619
had some amazing distillate but I don't

4417
03:13:06,149 --> 03:13:09,059
at all understand the height for the

4418
03:13:07,620 --> 03:13:11,400
clear and I know people that are

4419
03:13:09,059 --> 03:13:15,479
obsessed with the clear that rant and

4420
03:13:11,399 --> 03:13:17,430
rave about it because of the hype and

4421
03:13:15,479 --> 03:13:19,289
not because of its actual properties I

4422
03:13:17,430 --> 03:13:22,110
would prefer my distillate

4423
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:24,390
to come without turps and let me put my

4424
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:27,360
own turps in there that's why I would

4425
03:13:24,389 --> 03:13:29,819
prefer I see one of the things I really

4426
03:13:27,360 --> 03:13:32,790
like in in my hash was the reason I'm

4427
03:13:29,819 --> 03:13:35,159
such a live resident fanatic was that

4428
03:13:32,790 --> 03:13:40,740
flavor like it's already there I just

4429
03:13:35,159 --> 03:13:44,010
scooped in and glob yeah I yeah I was

4430
03:13:40,739 --> 03:13:47,670
gonna I was gonna let you have it but I

4431
03:13:44,010 --> 03:13:50,819
I the actuals like taking that a

4432
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:54,059
distillate dunking it that's fun for me

4433
03:13:50,819 --> 03:13:57,209
but that's I don't want to build it I

4434
03:13:54,059 --> 03:13:58,949
just want to enjoy it yeah and one of

4435
03:13:57,209 --> 03:14:03,679
the things I love about cannabis is the

4436
03:13:58,950 --> 03:14:03,680
the huge flavor profile variety and

4437
03:14:04,969 --> 03:14:09,049
it's more fun to me to taste with that

4438
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:10,879
flower was supposed to taste like then

4439
03:14:09,049 --> 03:14:13,250
going to the soda factory and have them

4440
03:14:10,879 --> 03:14:16,188
having them do like 25 different syrups

4441
03:14:13,250 --> 03:14:18,500
to create that soda flavor right yeah I

4442
03:14:16,189 --> 03:14:20,510
get you okay I just like when you can

4443
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:21,709
take some distillate I know I feel like

4444
03:14:20,510 --> 03:14:23,270
they kind of overdo it when they go

4445
03:14:21,709 --> 03:14:24,559
mixing the Terps in on their own when

4446
03:14:23,270 --> 03:14:26,779
they sell me the distillate it's

4447
03:14:24,559 --> 03:14:29,539
overdone every dish what I've had that

4448
03:14:26,779 --> 03:14:31,880
has terpenes reintroduced his way

4449
03:14:29,540 --> 03:14:34,189
overdone it yeah I'd rather be able to

4450
03:14:31,879 --> 03:14:36,049
do it myself and I can buy a bottle of

4451
03:14:34,189 --> 03:14:37,790
distillate and three or four vials of

4452
03:14:36,049 --> 03:14:39,500
turps and mix and match and make it the

4453
03:14:37,790 --> 03:14:41,000
way I want and then when I run out of

4454
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:43,279
that distillate I just put the chirps

4455
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:45,318
right on my shatter I've been getting

4456
03:14:43,279 --> 03:14:47,600
little tiny pipettes and just dipping it

4457
03:14:45,318 --> 03:14:50,359
right onto the shatter I do believe that

4458
03:14:47,600 --> 03:14:52,460
the terpenoids contribute heavily to my

4459
03:14:50,359 --> 03:14:55,340
high because I can dab the same shatter

4460
03:14:52,459 --> 03:14:57,500
and put different Terps on it if you get

4461
03:14:55,340 --> 03:15:01,068
different effects you tease the futures

4462
03:14:57,500 --> 03:15:05,719
show about lab testing and how it's

4463
03:15:01,068 --> 03:15:10,329
changed some things and it's definitely

4464
03:15:05,719 --> 03:15:12,920
helped us lose focus on the variety of

4465
03:15:10,329 --> 03:15:15,529
compounds in the plant that influence

4466
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:20,359
the the high the experience the medical

4467
03:15:15,529 --> 03:15:22,460
effect and I can't wait for that show

4468
03:15:20,359 --> 03:15:23,899
for these reasons exactly there's so

4469
03:15:22,459 --> 03:15:26,599
many different parts of the cannabis

4470
03:15:23,898 --> 03:15:28,369
plant the influence its effect on you

4471
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:31,189
and I think you're exactly right

4472
03:15:28,370 --> 03:15:34,189
terpenes are a huge portion huge um for

4473
03:15:31,189 --> 03:15:36,200
medical effect and the high you can feel

4474
03:15:34,189 --> 03:15:38,238
it with that 100% distillate when you go

4475
03:15:36,200 --> 03:15:40,970
from a ghost train hey stirrups to an OG

4476
03:15:38,238 --> 03:15:42,859
Kush strips that you're Dunkin and in

4477
03:15:40,969 --> 03:15:46,699
you can feel the high difference it's

4478
03:15:42,859 --> 03:15:48,409
the exact same THC the exact same but

4479
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:49,819
when you add in the other stuff that

4480
03:15:48,409 --> 03:15:52,670
doesn't affect the high it's the non

4481
03:15:49,818 --> 03:15:55,579
psychoactive stuff that you know the

4482
03:15:52,670 --> 03:15:59,779
materia it doesn't scare people as a

4483
03:15:55,579 --> 03:16:02,359
Final Fantasy 7 joke they uh it

4484
03:15:59,779 --> 03:16:06,130
completely changes the hive I was blown

4485
03:16:02,359 --> 03:16:06,130
away the first time I experienced it

4486
03:16:06,398 --> 03:16:11,670
it's all about all about the other

4487
03:16:09,100 --> 03:16:13,600
pieces yes it's all about that entourage

4488
03:16:11,670 --> 03:16:16,059
synergistic effect or do you want to

4489
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:20,050
call it I love the term entourage effect

4490
03:16:16,059 --> 03:16:22,500
it's it's so yeah and it's true because

4491
03:16:20,049 --> 03:16:28,019
like you said when I spoke these up

4492
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:28,020
these ghosts right here this is like

4493
03:16:29,639 --> 03:16:37,449
from my dad and then a second later like

4494
03:16:32,049 --> 03:16:39,250
I keep getting higher but if you put the

4495
03:16:37,450 --> 03:16:44,260
same dab and take some of that oh gee

4496
03:16:39,250 --> 03:16:45,700
cush like you were talking about you

4497
03:16:44,260 --> 03:16:47,290
want to drool in yourself for a couple

4498
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:49,600
seconds but if you take the thing it's

4499
03:16:47,290 --> 03:16:54,640
called para Digium you take that one I

4500
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:56,319
get hyper from they all have there's

4501
03:16:54,639 --> 03:16:57,969
something in those terpenoids it's doing

4502
03:16:56,319 --> 03:17:01,148
something completely different to your

4503
03:16:57,969 --> 03:17:03,909
body into your mind it it just releases

4504
03:17:01,148 --> 03:17:08,379
different different chemicals triggers

4505
03:17:03,909 --> 03:17:10,148
different things but yeah lab testing

4506
03:17:08,379 --> 03:17:12,279
has changed what we look forward is

4507
03:17:10,148 --> 03:17:14,439
consumers and that's drastically

4508
03:17:12,280 --> 03:17:17,380
changing the the consumption experience

4509
03:17:14,439 --> 03:17:19,870
absolutely well I hope that allowing

4510
03:17:17,379 --> 03:17:23,228
more PPM's in our concentrates does not

4511
03:17:19,870 --> 03:17:24,579
encourage hash makers too lazy up we're

4512
03:17:23,228 --> 03:17:26,769
getting really good at concentrate

4513
03:17:24,579 --> 03:17:28,750
making here in Colorado so I hope that

4514
03:17:26,770 --> 03:17:30,069
people just keep getting better shout

4515
03:17:28,750 --> 03:17:34,090
out to the people that are encouraging

4516
03:17:30,069 --> 03:17:36,010
and learning and making better hash yeah

4517
03:17:34,090 --> 03:17:38,559
I don't think anybody was really excited

4518
03:17:36,010 --> 03:17:40,898
about this as far as yeah now we can

4519
03:17:38,559 --> 03:17:43,000
shave 45 seconds off our back up and

4520
03:17:40,898 --> 03:17:44,648
cook you know when I first heard about

4521
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:46,030
this happening I was like oh what the

4522
03:17:44,648 --> 03:17:47,500
[ __ ] is happening but now that I've read

4523
03:17:46,030 --> 03:17:49,329
the article I think I understand a

4524
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:52,059
little more and I'm not as nervous or

4525
03:17:49,329 --> 03:17:54,010
paranoid about the entries if there was

4526
03:17:52,059 --> 03:17:55,840
ever a be a to where I can taste butane

4527
03:17:54,010 --> 03:17:58,270
in it you can guarantee that that hash

4528
03:17:55,840 --> 03:18:00,579
is going away I was a little worried

4529
03:17:58,270 --> 03:18:03,670
when it was only Leafly was was kind of

4530
03:18:00,579 --> 03:18:05,739
reporting this and I was I was happy to

4531
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:08,950
see the the level of reporting they did

4532
03:18:05,739 --> 03:18:12,670
but because they're not a hardcore news

4533
03:18:08,950 --> 03:18:15,220
org you see that wander a little bit the

4534
03:18:12,670 --> 03:18:17,049
guy I'm guessing he just said it as

4535
03:18:15,219 --> 03:18:18,369
something dumb during the interview and

4536
03:18:17,049 --> 03:18:19,809
I've been interviewed a lot at us

4537
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:21,369
sometimes stupid [ __ ] slips

4538
03:18:19,809 --> 03:18:24,010
I save plenty of [ __ ] on this podcast

4539
03:18:21,369 --> 03:18:27,130
please dome a good reporter I'll skip

4540
03:18:24,010 --> 03:18:29,800
over the brain fart that you uttered on

4541
03:18:27,129 --> 03:18:32,019
the record and stick to the on topic

4542
03:18:29,799 --> 03:18:34,478
point and in this reporter got hung up

4543
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:36,279
on that we might be talking about levels

4544
03:18:34,478 --> 03:18:38,139
that consumers could smell or taste and

4545
03:18:36,279 --> 03:18:40,328
then he goes on to say how these levels

4546
03:18:38,139 --> 03:18:43,599
are perfectly allowed in pharmaceutical

4547
03:18:40,328 --> 03:18:46,629
products if you can allow 5000 ppm of

4548
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:48,729
butane in an epidural inhaler have a

4549
03:18:46,629 --> 03:18:50,799
puter all and hate other people with

4550
03:18:48,728 --> 03:18:53,438
that level of people that they reported

4551
03:18:50,799 --> 03:18:55,809
the taste like that would be part of the

4552
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:58,270
study that he's citing for the increase

4553
03:18:55,809 --> 03:19:04,118
and it's not but because he mentioned

4554
03:18:58,270 --> 03:19:07,060
that to a reporter who's not obsessed

4555
03:19:04,119 --> 03:19:09,460
with keeping the story clean and factual

4556
03:19:07,059 --> 03:19:11,590
and he got hung up on something down the

4557
03:19:09,459 --> 03:19:13,209
guy said at the beginning and now half

4558
03:19:11,590 --> 03:19:15,130
of people that read that story are like

4559
03:19:13,209 --> 03:19:17,438
man I'm not buying hash Colorado anymore

4560
03:19:15,129 --> 03:19:19,118
- yeah - because you will know and

4561
03:19:17,439 --> 03:19:20,050
they're gonna be lab tests I can I see

4562
03:19:19,119 --> 03:19:22,270
your container you've got there's a

4563
03:19:20,049 --> 03:19:24,578
Panama East Coast Panama it's got the

4564
03:19:22,270 --> 03:19:28,449
lab testing real well on here this is

4565
03:19:24,578 --> 03:19:30,609
some this is from trip X and it is east

4566
03:19:28,449 --> 03:19:33,729
coast Panama chunk wax it's labeled

4567
03:19:30,609 --> 03:19:36,130
hybrid the next numbers listed on here

4568
03:19:33,728 --> 03:19:38,198
are the MIP which is the marijuana

4569
03:19:36,129 --> 03:19:40,389
infused product license it's got the

4570
03:19:38,199 --> 03:19:42,460
license number of who made the hash it's

4571
03:19:40,389 --> 03:19:44,828
got the OPC number which is the optional

4572
03:19:42,459 --> 03:19:46,539
premises cultivation center and it's

4573
03:19:44,828 --> 03:19:48,699
gotten their ID number that's where it

4574
03:19:46,540 --> 03:19:51,279
was grown then it's gonna batch number

4575
03:19:48,699 --> 03:19:53,408
so that we know which batch of plants

4576
03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:54,970
went into this mix by researching the

4577
03:19:53,408 --> 03:19:57,279
batch number we can tell you what plant

4578
03:19:54,969 --> 03:19:59,438
tags were in here which is each

4579
03:19:57,279 --> 03:20:01,479
individual plant which if they did it

4580
03:19:59,439 --> 03:20:03,100
that's how they track like those are the

4581
03:20:01,478 --> 03:20:04,868
members they used to do recall track

4582
03:20:03,100 --> 03:20:06,939
every Colorado we can tell you if that

4583
03:20:04,869 --> 03:20:08,229
plant has been applied a pesticide we

4584
03:20:06,939 --> 03:20:11,020
can tell you everything that plan has

4585
03:20:08,228 --> 03:20:12,818
been braid with fed we can tell you the

4586
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:14,619
date it was cut as a clone the day it

4587
03:20:12,818 --> 03:20:16,118
was moved into flower we can tell you

4588
03:20:14,619 --> 03:20:17,680
everything about mostly everything that

4589
03:20:16,119 --> 03:20:19,979
about that plant if it were properly

4590
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:22,148
documented by the grower and the metric

4591
03:20:19,978 --> 03:20:24,099
supervisor at that facility a lot of

4592
03:20:22,148 --> 03:20:25,539
times she tries to pass through testing

4593
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:27,100
results are what's gonna reveal the

4594
03:20:25,540 --> 03:20:29,140
truth so I'm looking at this container

4595
03:20:27,100 --> 03:20:33,200
it's got test results on it ayuh shows

4596
03:20:29,139 --> 03:20:36,560
me how much CBG a cbgc BDA

4597
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:39,260
CBD THC a THC and total cannabinoids are

4598
03:20:36,560 --> 03:20:40,699
on here now I assume that in the very

4599
03:20:39,260 --> 03:20:42,530
near future they're going to include

4600
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:45,050
these particles per million testing on

4601
03:20:42,530 --> 03:20:48,409
those those part of these rule changes

4602
03:20:45,049 --> 03:20:50,090
we're labeling changes that product is

4603
03:20:48,409 --> 03:20:55,789
this endowment that's an old product

4604
03:20:50,090 --> 03:20:59,210
okay you can hash for a minute I do I

4605
03:20:55,790 --> 03:21:01,550
love stockpiling so that I can let you

4606
03:20:59,209 --> 03:21:04,119
know every time I go to dad I've got 35

4607
03:21:01,549 --> 03:21:06,469
different flavors usually awesome

4608
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:08,570
planning and every now and then I

4609
03:21:06,469 --> 03:21:11,959
realized that I've had a cash container

4610
03:21:08,569 --> 03:21:14,420
for a year 14 months and then I make a

4611
03:21:11,959 --> 03:21:15,799
point to smoke real quick so it doesn't

4612
03:21:14,420 --> 03:21:19,610
convert any further if you need some

4613
03:21:15,799 --> 03:21:22,250
help let me know happy to old high THC

4614
03:21:19,610 --> 03:21:24,560
stuff that's had had some agent was

4615
03:21:22,250 --> 03:21:28,870
really good on inflammation of pain okay

4616
03:21:24,559 --> 03:21:33,590
[Music]

4617
03:21:28,870 --> 03:21:35,450
D carboxyl group it's it's a reason to

4618
03:21:33,590 --> 03:21:38,601
stash and a reason not to worry if he

4619
03:21:35,450 --> 03:21:40,610
gets a little old but yeah I'm I'm a

4620
03:21:38,601 --> 03:21:43,101
hoarder but this labeling isn't up to

4621
03:21:40,610 --> 03:21:44,360
par and it's still better than 99% of

4622
03:21:43,101 --> 03:21:47,810
the legal marijuana products she's gonna

4623
03:21:44,360 --> 03:21:49,101
find I'm sold in the US yes same thing

4624
03:21:47,810 --> 03:21:50,989
with the southern hash container I've

4625
03:21:49,101 --> 03:21:53,060
bought I've worn this label down a

4626
03:21:50,989 --> 03:21:54,199
little bit but a totally different

4627
03:21:53,060 --> 03:21:56,209
container totally different shape

4628
03:21:54,200 --> 03:21:58,190
totally different company exact same

4629
03:21:56,209 --> 03:22:00,289
information yeah and this one if you

4630
03:21:58,190 --> 03:22:02,780
look closely you can see that the butane

4631
03:22:00,290 --> 03:22:06,380
PPM's are listed on this oh nice can you

4632
03:22:02,780 --> 03:22:09,260
read it still um now I can I can read

4633
03:22:06,379 --> 03:22:11,659
that it used to be there and I actually

4634
03:22:09,260 --> 03:22:15,351
I believe it's triple zeros for both of

4635
03:22:11,659 --> 03:22:19,760
the the butane and that whatever that

4636
03:22:15,351 --> 03:22:23,260
next butane was nice job yeah and I see

4637
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:26,239
propane that was actually 2.75 left okay

4638
03:22:23,260 --> 03:22:27,771
that's not much not much at all but it's

4639
03:22:26,239 --> 03:22:29,149
for some live resin so that's to be a

4640
03:22:27,771 --> 03:22:30,681
little bit expected there's gonna be a

4641
03:22:29,149 --> 03:22:32,029
little bit of residual solvent left in

4642
03:22:30,681 --> 03:22:33,470
that it's got a lot of moisture going on

4643
03:22:32,030 --> 03:22:35,979
so it'll hold on to some stuff so it

4644
03:22:33,469 --> 03:22:39,278
looks real real

4645
03:22:35,978 --> 03:22:42,519
um it's almost like what's like sugary

4646
03:22:39,279 --> 03:22:46,960
butter Plato's and I don't know if you

4647
03:22:42,520 --> 03:22:49,420
ever did the thing with water and

4648
03:22:46,959 --> 03:22:51,248
cornstarch but if you ever like

4649
03:22:49,420 --> 03:22:52,510
scratched your fingernail and scratch

4650
03:22:51,248 --> 03:22:54,430
some of that out of there it's about

4651
03:22:52,510 --> 03:22:57,728
that consistency I would totally dab

4652
03:22:54,430 --> 03:22:58,720
that stuff by the looks I loved I love

4653
03:22:57,728 --> 03:22:59,889
this company I don't really want to

4654
03:22:58,719 --> 03:23:00,998
shadow max we've done a lot of shout

4655
03:22:59,889 --> 03:23:02,618
outs on this show but they make some

4656
03:23:00,998 --> 03:23:07,148
awesome live resin and I Drive really

4657
03:23:02,619 --> 03:23:08,979
far to get it sometimes in Colorado

4658
03:23:07,148 --> 03:23:10,209
people are like but there's storms every

4659
03:23:08,978 --> 03:23:11,590
there are stores everywhere Nick yeah

4660
03:23:10,209 --> 03:23:14,019
but I Drive up to Denver to this one

4661
03:23:11,590 --> 03:23:15,850
place I Drive from West Pueblo not

4662
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:19,539
Pueblo West with the west side of Pueblo

4663
03:23:15,850 --> 03:23:21,430
to the very far north end in Denver it's

4664
03:23:19,539 --> 03:23:24,520
like a hundred and twenty-six miles if I

4665
03:23:21,430 --> 03:23:26,770
Drive past at least 300 marijuana stores

4666
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:29,140
yeah to go to the one with the product

4667
03:23:26,770 --> 03:23:30,988
that like yeah I do and have done and

4668
03:23:29,139 --> 03:23:33,129
will do the same thing in the future

4669
03:23:30,988 --> 03:23:34,420
only like there are two or three

4670
03:23:33,129 --> 03:23:37,089
dispensaries in Denver that I like to

4671
03:23:34,420 --> 03:23:38,710
really shop at yep all right so you guys

4672
03:23:37,090 --> 03:23:40,270
don't worry about it's not gonna be that

4673
03:23:38,709 --> 03:23:41,769
big of a deal if you come to Colorado to

4674
03:23:40,270 --> 03:23:43,569
buy some concentrates and you get these

4675
03:23:41,770 --> 03:23:44,850
high numbers you're gonna notice if

4676
03:23:43,568 --> 03:23:47,379
something's wrong

4677
03:23:44,850 --> 03:23:51,520
p.m. numbers freak you out like if

4678
03:23:47,379 --> 03:23:52,809
you're buying shatter in it shatters you

4679
03:23:51,520 --> 03:23:54,279
don't have to worry about residual

4680
03:23:52,809 --> 03:23:56,228
butane you're probably doing all right

4681
03:23:54,279 --> 03:23:57,729
if it's on the Shelf and they've got it

4682
03:23:56,228 --> 03:24:00,219
it's the store you're probably doing

4683
03:23:57,728 --> 03:24:02,198
okay because they'll get concentrates

4684
03:24:00,219 --> 03:24:03,459
that [ __ ] won't sell it'll go on sale

4685
03:24:02,199 --> 03:24:05,260
they'll get rid of it the first time

4686
03:24:03,459 --> 03:24:07,658
they'll never buy it again if the

4687
03:24:05,260 --> 03:24:11,859
employees our customers as well most of

4688
03:24:07,658 --> 03:24:14,260
the time I mean is a consumer that

4689
03:24:11,859 --> 03:24:15,789
doesn't really know a whole lot the one

4690
03:24:14,260 --> 03:24:18,100
thing you want to look out for is if you

4691
03:24:15,789 --> 03:24:21,489
go to a shop and they go I mean just for

4692
03:24:18,100 --> 03:24:25,960
example this is 50 this is 55 this is 65

4693
03:24:21,488 --> 03:24:29,198
oh and we have these for $19.99 be wary

4694
03:24:25,959 --> 03:24:31,868
at the 1999 there's there's a reason

4695
03:24:29,199 --> 03:24:33,760
that there's that big big discount for

4696
03:24:31,869 --> 03:24:36,351
that one particular thing it might be

4697
03:24:33,760 --> 03:24:39,271
old it might be about smooth

4698
03:24:36,351 --> 03:24:40,530
passed out like a friend of mine had to

4699
03:24:39,271 --> 03:24:44,221
throw out a whole bunch of product at

4700
03:24:40,530 --> 03:24:46,891
his store because labeling labels

4701
03:24:44,220 --> 03:24:51,180
expired and you can't just slap on a new

4702
03:24:46,890 --> 03:24:53,190
label that's terrible um that when that

4703
03:24:51,181 --> 03:24:55,711
date's getting close you'll watch it go

4704
03:24:53,190 --> 03:24:57,540
from full price to half price to exactly

4705
03:24:55,710 --> 03:24:59,609
what the shop paid for it to half what

4706
03:24:57,540 --> 03:25:02,761
the shop paid for it to please God let

4707
03:24:59,610 --> 03:25:06,150
me get any of my money back on it before

4708
03:25:02,761 --> 03:25:08,489
you know the first or whatever hits and

4709
03:25:06,149 --> 03:25:10,770
sometimes is a consumer that can be real

4710
03:25:08,489 --> 03:25:12,390
helpful and sometimes that just means

4711
03:25:10,771 --> 03:25:19,079
that's the crap that they got tricked

4712
03:25:12,390 --> 03:25:20,399
into by just a bit gnarly dad yeah one

4713
03:25:19,079 --> 03:25:21,960
thing I want to mention is something

4714
03:25:20,399 --> 03:25:23,310
I've experienced in Colorado and I'm

4715
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:28,279
gonna quit talking funnier in just a

4716
03:25:23,310 --> 03:25:30,841
second but something that happens a

4717
03:25:28,280 --> 03:25:32,610
extraction company and we're just gonna

4718
03:25:30,841 --> 03:25:34,200
say that Mike and I have an extraction

4719
03:25:32,610 --> 03:25:36,511
company so Jeff and Mike's extraction

4720
03:25:34,200 --> 03:25:39,381
company we make extracts that's our

4721
03:25:36,511 --> 03:25:42,631
specialty what we do is we go to

4722
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:45,210
dispensaries that have aggro involved in

4723
03:25:42,630 --> 03:25:47,039
there and their business plan so there's

4724
03:25:45,210 --> 03:25:48,600
a dispensary with a grow that grows

4725
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:51,001
product and that product goes to the

4726
03:25:48,601 --> 03:25:52,739
dispensary for sale what we offer to do

4727
03:25:51,001 --> 03:25:56,819
as an extraction company is we will take

4728
03:25:52,739 --> 03:25:58,289
either your buds or your trim material

4729
03:25:56,819 --> 03:26:01,171
you want to give us and we would gladly

4730
03:25:58,290 --> 03:26:03,181
turn it into product for you for a price

4731
03:26:01,171 --> 03:26:04,470
there is usually I don't know how much

4732
03:26:03,181 --> 03:26:06,390
insider info I should give but there's

4733
03:26:04,470 --> 03:26:08,609
usually a deal worked out to where

4734
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:10,739
there's an industry range that I run it

4735
03:26:08,610 --> 03:26:12,569
we run it as a company and we split it

4736
03:26:10,739 --> 03:26:14,399
with you 50/50 and then we get half of

4737
03:26:12,569 --> 03:26:17,130
the product that's done we package it

4738
03:26:14,399 --> 03:26:19,199
and everything and then we deliver your

4739
03:26:17,130 --> 03:26:22,560
portion back to the store and you put it

4740
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:25,141
on the shelf for sale and now the other

4741
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:28,140
way to do it is we run it and we sell it

4742
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:30,720
back to your dispensary at a price and

4743
03:26:28,140 --> 03:26:32,310
those prices vary widely depending on

4744
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:34,109
the company and the deals that you work

4745
03:26:32,310 --> 03:26:36,569
out and how much product you're running

4746
03:26:34,110 --> 03:26:39,091
the quality of the product the final

4747
03:26:36,569 --> 03:26:42,270
product consistency the popularity of

4748
03:26:39,091 --> 03:26:45,390
the companies Kim if if you're if you

4749
03:26:42,271 --> 03:26:47,040
were one of the top known grows and one

4750
03:26:45,390 --> 03:26:49,229
of the top known extract companies

4751
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:50,130
they'll run the ship for damn near free

4752
03:26:49,229 --> 03:26:52,170
for each other

4753
03:26:50,129 --> 03:26:53,608
so that they can both say ran by these

4754
03:26:52,170 --> 03:26:55,559
companies and they both make a ton of

4755
03:26:53,609 --> 03:26:58,170
[ __ ] money off you usually see a

4756
03:26:55,559 --> 03:27:03,750
pretty pretty tight range in hash

4757
03:26:58,170 --> 03:27:05,398
pricing it at the shop and I mean it'll

4758
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:08,398
be like a ten or fifteen dollar window

4759
03:27:05,398 --> 03:27:10,920
in the the cheapest one in that window

4760
03:27:08,398 --> 03:27:13,500
is usually a company you've never heard

4761
03:27:10,920 --> 03:27:17,369
right and that doesn't mean anything

4762
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:19,408
other than their knew of them of that

4763
03:27:17,369 --> 03:27:22,739
company of that range is a company

4764
03:27:19,408 --> 03:27:24,420
called extracts they are not known but I

4765
03:27:22,738 --> 03:27:27,118
think lately they've been kicking out

4766
03:27:24,420 --> 03:27:30,478
some ridiculously good concentrates at a

4767
03:27:27,119 --> 03:27:36,119
very low price their packaging is plain

4768
03:27:30,478 --> 03:27:39,028
they don't have any advertising I've

4769
03:27:36,119 --> 03:27:42,779
seen a half dozen new extract companies

4770
03:27:39,029 --> 03:27:44,729
that I've never heard of before whether

4771
03:27:42,779 --> 03:27:48,180
the first product I see from them is

4772
03:27:44,728 --> 03:27:49,709
stellar incredible so I had no idea that

4773
03:27:48,180 --> 03:27:51,840
they were doing hash they make some of

4774
03:27:49,709 --> 03:27:53,938
the best stuff the first time I saw it

4775
03:27:51,840 --> 03:27:55,439
it was actually granny that yeah that

4776
03:27:53,939 --> 03:28:02,279
had it she opened it up and I was like

4777
03:27:55,439 --> 03:28:04,380
oh yeah there's a company down here that

4778
03:28:02,279 --> 03:28:05,510
they used to come into the shop I was

4779
03:28:04,379 --> 03:28:07,589
working out all the time

4780
03:28:05,510 --> 03:28:09,119
that's brand new was just getting on

4781
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:13,799
their feet and I've seen some really

4782
03:28:09,119 --> 03:28:15,090
nice stuff from that lately it's nice to

4783
03:28:13,799 --> 03:28:16,829
see this much quality come on though

4784
03:28:15,090 --> 03:28:19,648
coming on the market was something where

4785
03:28:16,829 --> 03:28:21,750
I was headed with all of this is what

4786
03:28:19,648 --> 03:28:23,219
kid if you find it if you buy an extract

4787
03:28:21,750 --> 03:28:24,629
from the next rack company say you get

4788
03:28:23,219 --> 03:28:29,488
something what do we name our company I

4789
03:28:24,629 --> 03:28:31,978
gave us a name but if you buy a problem

4790
03:28:29,488 --> 03:28:34,859
but we are running material grown by

4791
03:28:31,978 --> 03:28:36,028
other dispensaries so if we buy I'm

4792
03:28:34,859 --> 03:28:37,380
gonna throw them right under the [ __ ]

4793
03:28:36,029 --> 03:28:39,029
bus if we buy some material from

4794
03:28:37,379 --> 03:28:41,849
Maggie's Farm and run it it's gonna come

4795
03:28:39,029 --> 03:28:43,859
out Brown and janky it always does I've

4796
03:28:41,850 --> 03:28:45,869
heard I've seen several extract

4797
03:28:43,859 --> 03:28:47,729
companies run Maggie's Farm stuff it's

4798
03:28:45,869 --> 03:28:49,380
not quality something about their grow I

4799
03:28:47,728 --> 03:28:51,148
think they trim with the trim machine

4800
03:28:49,379 --> 03:28:52,528
which will [ __ ] up your extract I think

4801
03:28:51,148 --> 03:28:54,299
they're using old material which will

4802
03:28:52,529 --> 03:28:57,000
[ __ ] up your extract their stuff never

4803
03:28:54,299 --> 03:28:59,289
comes out good if you run stuff for some

4804
03:28:57,000 --> 03:29:01,840
different things that going into a grow

4805
03:28:59,290 --> 03:29:04,750
[ __ ] up the X right if you run material

4806
03:29:01,840 --> 03:29:08,649
from kind love it always comes back fire

4807
03:29:04,750 --> 03:29:11,379
so it's not it's a good portion of the

4808
03:29:08,649 --> 03:29:13,539
hash work is up to the company that's

4809
03:29:11,379 --> 03:29:15,129
running your extract but a large portion

4810
03:29:13,540 --> 03:29:16,810
of it is up to whoever grew that

4811
03:29:15,129 --> 03:29:18,399
material how long the material said

4812
03:29:16,809 --> 03:29:22,299
around how it was stored how it was

4813
03:29:18,399 --> 03:29:24,789
trimmed that is a huge factor so if you

4814
03:29:22,299 --> 03:29:26,649
buy some extracts from a hash company if

4815
03:29:24,790 --> 03:29:29,350
Mike and if you buy some Mike and Jeff

4816
03:29:26,649 --> 03:29:31,239
extracts and it's shitty one time and

4817
03:29:29,350 --> 03:29:33,100
amazing one time you've kind of got to

4818
03:29:31,239 --> 03:29:36,521
keep in mind to go look at this little

4819
03:29:33,100 --> 03:29:39,521
OPC and MIP tag on here and see what the

4820
03:29:36,521 --> 03:29:42,040
the OPC number is because that will tell

4821
03:29:39,521 --> 03:29:44,560
you who grew it and it varies wildly

4822
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:46,030
batch to batch with with some companies

4823
03:29:44,559 --> 03:29:49,420
other companies that are a little more

4824
03:29:46,030 --> 03:29:51,690
established I see less variety in the

4825
03:29:49,420 --> 03:29:55,260
end what they're putting on shelves but

4826
03:29:51,690 --> 03:30:00,159
for a while like a year and a half ago

4827
03:29:55,260 --> 03:30:03,550
you would see I mean like a plus F plus

4828
03:30:00,159 --> 03:30:04,989
yeah I mean in the same ship it's like

4829
03:30:03,549 --> 03:30:06,879
the products will be really really good

4830
03:30:04,989 --> 03:30:08,289
for a little while and then one guy will

4831
03:30:06,879 --> 03:30:10,539
quit and everything just falls apart

4832
03:30:08,290 --> 03:30:13,180
until we figured out what the new and

4833
03:30:10,540 --> 03:30:15,310
the other side of that coin is if you go

4834
03:30:13,180 --> 03:30:17,860
to a shop and you see a strain you like

4835
03:30:15,309 --> 03:30:20,260
and you take a look at the hash and it's

4836
03:30:17,860 --> 03:30:21,550
a quality the that looks good to you and

4837
03:30:20,260 --> 03:30:25,000
you take it home you hate it and you

4838
03:30:21,549 --> 03:30:28,449
love it and you want more go back and

4839
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:31,239
get more right away yeah because just

4840
03:30:28,450 --> 03:30:33,579
the nature of the industry extract

4841
03:30:31,239 --> 03:30:36,190
companies by what's available there's no

4842
03:30:33,579 --> 03:30:38,260
guarantee that that strain is going to

4843
03:30:36,190 --> 03:30:41,890
be made available to that extract

4844
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:44,680
company again or then if it does then

4845
03:30:41,889 --> 03:30:47,590
it'll be that quality that that same

4846
03:30:44,680 --> 03:30:49,750
artist or our team of people will be

4847
03:30:47,590 --> 03:30:52,600
we're doing the extraction in the same

4848
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:55,209
way a lot of times that'll be a blend of

4849
03:30:52,600 --> 03:30:57,460
flowers like we the extractors will take

4850
03:30:55,209 --> 03:30:58,929
a minimum of usually a thousand grams to

4851
03:30:57,459 --> 03:31:00,429
run they don't want less than a thousand

4852
03:30:58,930 --> 03:31:02,979
grams out to what fits in their column

4853
03:31:00,430 --> 03:31:05,079
and you don't always have a say if you

4854
03:31:02,979 --> 03:31:06,699
had a thousand grams of something it

4855
03:31:05,079 --> 03:31:08,139
would be buds and it wouldn't be a bunch

4856
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:09,999
of [ __ ] shake to run

4857
03:31:08,139 --> 03:31:11,858
so it wouldn't even happen so maybe

4858
03:31:09,998 --> 03:31:13,689
they're putting what is this you got

4859
03:31:11,859 --> 03:31:15,640
East Coast pineapple antenor that's a

4860
03:31:13,689 --> 03:31:18,550
real strain maybe you got some busy man

4861
03:31:15,639 --> 03:31:25,118
some golden time when it's when it

4862
03:31:18,549 --> 03:31:26,378
sounds like two names swish together for

4863
03:31:25,119 --> 03:31:28,119
an hour but you just put me on something

4864
03:31:26,379 --> 03:31:29,409
that I want to [ __ ] about I hate it

4865
03:31:28,119 --> 03:31:31,748
when extract companies do that it

4866
03:31:29,408 --> 03:31:33,908
bothers me as a medical product we don't

4867
03:31:31,748 --> 03:31:35,770
need extract companies creating [ __ ]

4868
03:31:33,908 --> 03:31:38,139
names out of their hash blends it's this

4869
03:31:35,770 --> 03:31:38,970
I have the same issue with growers give

4870
03:31:38,139 --> 03:31:42,368
it a minute

4871
03:31:38,969 --> 03:31:45,639
stabilize it then rename it but it's not

4872
03:31:42,369 --> 03:31:47,890
it's a renaming thing sucks something

4873
03:31:45,639 --> 03:31:50,139
that I find important there are strains

4874
03:31:47,889 --> 03:31:52,538
that are well-known certain people rely

4875
03:31:50,139 --> 03:31:54,458
on certain strains I don't know what

4876
03:31:52,539 --> 03:31:56,890
strain grateful dog works well for you

4877
03:31:54,459 --> 03:32:09,789
I've got a blue headband and I have no

4878
03:31:56,889 --> 03:32:13,840
[ __ ] clue I wish that company would

4879
03:32:09,789 --> 03:32:15,489
have put blue dream and blue or headband

4880
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:16,930
so that we know what you're smoking

4881
03:32:15,488 --> 03:32:19,090
because if that works wonderfully for

4882
03:32:16,930 --> 03:32:21,998
you we can go find more blue berry or

4883
03:32:19,090 --> 03:32:23,529
blue dream and more headband for you but

4884
03:32:21,998 --> 03:32:24,969
they're just and now they're also kind

4885
03:32:23,529 --> 03:32:27,310
of creating confusion because what if

4886
03:32:24,969 --> 03:32:29,260
somebody does have blue headband as a

4887
03:32:27,309 --> 03:32:30,878
real flower and a real cross that a

4888
03:32:29,260 --> 03:32:34,600
breeder will they actually took their

4889
03:32:30,879 --> 03:32:36,669
time to make pills for the consumer is I

4890
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:38,199
mean people are creatures of habit they

4891
03:32:36,668 --> 03:32:39,939
want to go to the store and they want

4892
03:32:38,199 --> 03:32:41,319
their [ __ ] six-pack of Corona yeah

4893
03:32:39,939 --> 03:32:43,148
and they want the same thing when they

4894
03:32:41,318 --> 03:32:45,368
go to the grocery they want to walk in

4895
03:32:43,148 --> 03:32:47,049
and get there there's three favorite

4896
03:32:45,369 --> 03:32:49,359
things just like they do it every other

4897
03:32:47,049 --> 03:32:50,918
store in their world and unfortunately

4898
03:32:49,359 --> 03:32:54,609
when you walk into a marijuana store

4899
03:32:50,918 --> 03:32:56,818
it's yeah I understand that you really

4900
03:32:54,609 --> 03:32:59,709
loved that blue tree we bought last week

4901
03:32:56,818 --> 03:33:02,038
it was you know a really good cut it was

4902
03:32:59,709 --> 03:33:04,829
real popular we're out of that now

4903
03:33:02,039 --> 03:33:05,979
here's where it falls in the range of

4904
03:33:04,828 --> 03:33:08,770
genetics

4905
03:33:05,978 --> 03:33:12,309
here's stuff that's similar good luck

4906
03:33:08,770 --> 03:33:14,619
picking a new huh and I mean you can

4907
03:33:12,309 --> 03:33:17,680
come back tomorrow it asks for more blue

4908
03:33:14,619 --> 03:33:21,489
dreaming you're gonna either but maybe

4909
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:23,619
in 54 days yeah eventually there will be

4910
03:33:21,488 --> 03:33:27,219
more but when that will be and when it's

4911
03:33:23,619 --> 03:33:30,640
stuff like hash the the store has almost

4912
03:33:27,219 --> 03:33:31,809
no ability to call the extract company

4913
03:33:30,639 --> 03:33:32,728
and be like yeah we need more Sour

4914
03:33:31,809 --> 03:33:34,658
Diesel

4915
03:33:32,728 --> 03:33:36,818
there might be some Sour Diesel

4916
03:33:34,658 --> 03:33:39,158
available that they're about to run for

4917
03:33:36,818 --> 03:33:42,519
you there might not be any offered to

4918
03:33:39,158 --> 03:33:44,049
that extract company for years unless

4919
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:46,539
they're growing the stuff they're

4920
03:33:44,049 --> 03:33:48,398
processing right or unless the shop is

4921
03:33:46,539 --> 03:33:51,850
selling the material to the extract

4922
03:33:48,398 --> 03:33:53,680
company there's no way to guarantee that

4923
03:33:51,850 --> 03:33:56,439
materials gonna be there when it's time

4924
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:59,529
to read up a shipment so you're you're

4925
03:33:56,439 --> 03:34:01,539
kind of forced to go find new stuff that

4926
03:33:59,529 --> 03:34:04,498
you like which is you know good and bad

4927
03:34:01,539 --> 03:34:08,470
I like it because I like a big variety

4928
03:34:04,498 --> 03:34:10,119
if you there's so many people off there

4929
03:34:08,469 --> 03:34:12,158
are some people that are very in my

4930
03:34:10,119 --> 03:34:14,709
opinion it's too specific about their

4931
03:34:12,158 --> 03:34:16,238
THC and cannabis needs I think that

4932
03:34:14,709 --> 03:34:18,310
they're a little spoiled and they should

4933
03:34:16,238 --> 03:34:20,770
just smoke some dope and relax but some

4934
03:34:18,309 --> 03:34:23,978
people I cannot smoke stuff with the

4935
03:34:20,770 --> 03:34:28,449
word cush or this they can or I cannot

4936
03:34:23,978 --> 03:34:30,429
smoke heavy sativas it's part of the

4937
03:34:28,449 --> 03:34:33,520
evolutionary process where our brains

4938
03:34:30,430 --> 03:34:36,459
are just designed to remember stuff that

4939
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:39,069
we didn't like or that we perceived is

4940
03:34:36,459 --> 03:34:42,760
hurtful and when it's stuff like foods

4941
03:34:39,068 --> 03:34:45,068
and intoxicants I mean we hold onto

4942
03:34:42,760 --> 03:34:47,859
those memories for life everybody's got

4943
03:34:45,068 --> 03:34:50,458
that one alcoholic beverage that they

4944
03:34:47,859 --> 03:34:54,729
got ahold of when they were 13 14 15

4945
03:34:50,459 --> 03:34:56,470
yeah it was water and then threw up for

4946
03:34:54,728 --> 03:35:01,049
a day and a half every when they can't

4947
03:34:56,469 --> 03:35:04,929
even see sour apple pucker or banana red

4948
03:35:01,049 --> 03:35:07,179
without that you took that to a personal

4949
03:35:04,930 --> 03:35:09,850
place didn't you know ice actually I

4950
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:12,639
doubt that person were those two

4951
03:35:09,850 --> 03:35:14,318
references are there things would ever

4952
03:35:12,639 --> 03:35:15,709
listen to the show but on the off chance

4953
03:35:14,318 --> 03:35:19,069
they do that laughter

4954
03:35:15,709 --> 03:35:22,849
the other part but from for me it's

4955
03:35:19,069 --> 03:35:24,829
Miller Lite mg DS shouldn't be drinking

4956
03:35:22,850 --> 03:35:27,020
my piss anyway died it was what was

4957
03:35:24,829 --> 03:35:29,629
there when we were that age he had a

4958
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:31,819
friend drank way too much of it he did

4959
03:35:29,629 --> 03:35:33,649
the infamous puke fart and I was

4960
03:35:31,819 --> 03:35:36,680
hungover for like five days now even

4961
03:35:33,649 --> 03:35:38,299
when I see the label I throw and I used

4962
03:35:36,680 --> 03:35:40,940
to have to go buy it for somebody in my

4963
03:35:38,299 --> 03:35:42,619
life a lot and that was always a fun

4964
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:43,909
trip back from the store because I'm

4965
03:35:42,620 --> 03:35:45,350
trying not to look at what's in the

4966
03:35:43,909 --> 03:35:45,829
passenger seat cause it's making me

4967
03:35:45,350 --> 03:35:50,930
nauseous

4968
03:35:45,829 --> 03:35:52,610
so I felt about rum it's the same thing

4969
03:35:50,930 --> 03:35:55,489
with cannabis somebody smokes way too

4970
03:35:52,610 --> 03:35:57,229
much cush one night and it's how much

4971
03:35:55,489 --> 03:35:58,309
they consumed how they consumed it

4972
03:35:57,228 --> 03:36:01,340
doesn't have anything to do with the

4973
03:35:58,309 --> 03:36:03,139
strainer that it was an indica but now

4974
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:04,760
every time they go to a dispensary they

4975
03:36:03,139 --> 03:36:08,359
make a big deal about how it can't be

4976
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:10,940
touched to their bud tender or a can't

4977
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:12,500
say Durban in it that no I smoked too

4978
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:14,210
much Durban the first time I came to

4979
03:36:12,500 --> 03:36:16,100
Colorado and I was alone in my hotel

4980
03:36:14,209 --> 03:36:17,779
room and I ate that whole that whole

4981
03:36:16,100 --> 03:36:19,250
brownie and then I smoked that Durban

4982
03:36:17,780 --> 03:36:21,979
poison and it was just too much and I

4983
03:36:19,250 --> 03:36:25,100
don't want that Durban it's like dude it

4984
03:36:21,978 --> 03:36:26,840
was that my son can haz Cheezburger

4985
03:36:25,100 --> 03:36:29,870
didn't have nothing to do with let's

4986
03:36:26,840 --> 03:36:31,728
train you picked but explaining that

4987
03:36:29,870 --> 03:36:33,200
it's difficult and then when they get

4988
03:36:31,728 --> 03:36:34,670
there and that the one thing they found

4989
03:36:33,200 --> 03:36:35,750
that they really like you're out of and

4990
03:36:34,670 --> 03:36:37,489
I have to start the process all over

4991
03:36:35,750 --> 03:36:41,629
again like it can be kind of headache II

4992
03:36:37,489 --> 03:36:43,369
I wish more people expected it okay

4993
03:36:41,629 --> 03:36:44,420
cannabis market we've got to regulate it

4994
03:36:43,370 --> 03:36:45,590
a little bit better so we've got the

4995
03:36:44,420 --> 03:36:48,559
products and people want but it's hard

4996
03:36:45,590 --> 03:36:50,659
to remind myself how lucky we are here

4997
03:36:48,559 --> 03:36:53,689
the good [ __ ] sells out that's how it

4998
03:36:50,659 --> 03:37:00,670
goes it's a first world problem in the

4999
03:36:53,690 --> 03:37:03,770
extreme yeah we're so spoiled here with

5000
03:37:00,670 --> 03:37:06,590
our marijuana markets in the vast

5001
03:37:03,770 --> 03:37:10,399
assortment of products it's available in

5002
03:37:06,590 --> 03:37:13,790
that market I mean prices are coming

5003
03:37:10,399 --> 03:37:17,629
down quality's going up selections going

5004
03:37:13,790 --> 03:37:19,760
up it's good for suppositories now you

5005
03:37:17,629 --> 03:37:21,619
can take your wheat in every way I put

5006
03:37:19,760 --> 03:37:23,630
some weed pain cream on today before I

5007
03:37:21,620 --> 03:37:25,400
left the house I gave them both knees a

5008
03:37:23,629 --> 03:37:26,000
coat before I started getting ready to

5009
03:37:25,399 --> 03:37:29,840
come over for the

5010
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:31,489
show we've got suppositories we've got

5011
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:32,000
lozenges we've got sprays we've got

5012
03:37:31,489 --> 03:37:34,850
pills

5013
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:37,940
we've got flowers we've got a hundred

5014
03:37:34,850 --> 03:37:39,920
different kinds of hash when you go to

5015
03:37:37,940 --> 03:37:42,500
this when you went to a dispensary a

5016
03:37:39,920 --> 03:37:46,309
year and a half ago open was the only

5017
03:37:42,500 --> 03:37:48,950
vape pen on the shelf now there are

5018
03:37:46,309 --> 03:37:50,449
hundreds of a pen companies you know

5019
03:37:48,950 --> 03:37:53,020
with hundreds of different qualities

5020
03:37:50,450 --> 03:37:55,460
honors the different strain options I

5021
03:37:53,020 --> 03:37:57,170
love the things are strained specific

5022
03:37:55,459 --> 03:37:59,539
now - that's so great this screen

5023
03:37:57,170 --> 03:38:01,010
specific edibles strain specific vape

5024
03:37:59,540 --> 03:38:03,050
pens that [ __ ] is so great instead of

5025
03:38:01,010 --> 03:38:09,739
just indica sativa or hybrid you can get

5026
03:38:03,049 --> 03:38:13,609
actual we move closer to the micro brew

5027
03:38:09,739 --> 03:38:15,319
model every day with the quality in the

5028
03:38:13,610 --> 03:38:17,420
selection of products that we've got and

5029
03:38:15,319 --> 03:38:20,539
it's absolutely wonderful and then I

5030
03:38:17,420 --> 03:38:22,909
look at I mean just next door to us most

5031
03:38:20,540 --> 03:38:26,300
of the states this around Colorado are

5032
03:38:22,909 --> 03:38:29,170
still under full prohibition where my

5033
03:38:26,299 --> 03:38:32,359
friends scored a handful of good herb

5034
03:38:29,170 --> 03:38:33,950
good weed like that's what they know

5035
03:38:32,360 --> 03:38:35,930
about it is that their friends scored it

5036
03:38:33,950 --> 03:38:37,400
and it's good yeah and that's the end of

5037
03:38:35,930 --> 03:38:39,409
the information that they will ever have

5038
03:38:37,399 --> 03:38:40,940
on it I don't miss those days when you

5039
03:38:39,409 --> 03:38:42,979
go to get some weed and they had some

5040
03:38:40,940 --> 03:38:45,409
weed and you got whatever was there it

5041
03:38:42,979 --> 03:38:47,510
was that was one of the things I like

5042
03:38:45,409 --> 03:38:49,369
most about working the retail counter is

5043
03:38:47,510 --> 03:38:55,280
watching people's faces light up like

5044
03:38:49,370 --> 03:38:56,750
they were just learning about Santa if I

5045
03:38:55,280 --> 03:38:58,550
get to watch the numbers on the scale

5046
03:38:56,750 --> 03:38:59,120
from my side and your side that's

5047
03:38:58,549 --> 03:39:02,329
awesome

5048
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:04,220
yep it's so much fun watching people's

5049
03:39:02,329 --> 03:39:08,000
faces light up when they see what the

5050
03:39:04,219 --> 03:39:09,709
possibilities really are for this but

5051
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:11,389
then again I read stuff like how it is

5052
03:39:09,709 --> 03:39:14,479
on the East Coast right now in a lot of

5053
03:39:11,389 --> 03:39:15,319
places and I just cringe that's why

5054
03:39:14,479 --> 03:39:17,709
we're here we're trying to educate

5055
03:39:15,319 --> 03:39:20,270
everybody so that we can legalize places

5056
03:39:17,709 --> 03:39:21,559
everywhere legalize cannabis you guys is

5057

5110
03:41:11,439 --> 03:41:13,689
what I'm trying to do I'm trying to

5111
03:41:12,488 --> 03:41:14,948
cover the cost of the website to keep

5112
03:41:13,689 --> 03:41:16,568
the podcast coming to you so that

5113
03:41:14,949 --> 03:41:18,248
doesn't come out of my pocket I can

5114
03:41:16,568 --> 03:41:18,668
cover it but I'd rather not that's all

5115
03:41:18,248 --> 03:41:20,679
I'm saying

5116
03:41:18,668 --> 03:41:22,179
if you find that you got some value from

5117
03:41:20,679 --> 03:41:24,520

5120
03:41:25,838 --> 03:41:29,408

5122

on for a long time Mike I owe you a huge

5126
03:41:35,468 --> 03:41:40,598
thank you for coming to do a two podcast

5127
03:41:37,148 --> 03:41:42,128
with me yeah we did a good job I think

5128
03:41:40,599 --> 03:41:43,088
you did a great job I let you talk for a

5129
03:41:42,129 --> 03:41:43,900
whole bunch because you had a lot of

5130
03:41:43,088 --> 03:41:47,591
[ __ ] on your mind so

5131
03:41:43,899 --> 03:41:49,539
I guess it's been a really fun couple of

5132
03:41:47,591 --> 03:41:51,220
weeks and news it has been a lot of

5133
03:41:49,540 --> 03:41:54,101
scary news announcements but there's

5134
03:41:51,220 --> 03:41:55,569
been a lot of good ones too I cannot

5135
03:41:54,101 --> 03:41:57,881
wait to see what the future brings

5136
03:41:55,569 --> 03:42:02,890
dude it's 2017 is gonna be interesting

5137
03:41:57,880 --> 03:42:05,409
[ __ ] if not all in good ways he just

5138
03:42:02,890 --> 03:42:11,619
made 37 facial expressions trying to

5139
03:42:05,409 --> 03:42:13,869
think about these dudes masks broke the

5140
03:42:11,620 --> 03:42:16,150
only thing that got less likely is the

5141
03:42:13,870 --> 03:42:18,490
aliens making contact guaranteed if

5142
03:42:16,149 --> 03:42:20,380
they're watching us from above they're

5143
03:42:18,489 --> 03:42:22,511
continuing their policy of wait and see

5144
03:42:20,380 --> 03:42:24,130
for the next four years other than that

5145
03:42:22,511 --> 03:42:26,500
pretty much every [ __ ] other

5146
03:42:24,130 --> 03:42:28,149
possibility from peace on earth to

5147
03:42:26,500 --> 03:42:32,140
nuclear war got like five percent more

5148
03:42:28,149 --> 03:42:33,819
likely this year to last year so yeah

5149
03:42:32,140 --> 03:42:36,609
it's gonna be an interesting year for

5150
03:42:33,819 --> 03:42:38,190
damn sure it's absolutely going to be an

5151
03:42:36,610 --> 03:42:41,351
interesting year that Dan's got the

5152
03:42:38,190 --> 03:42:46,899
combination to the button

5153
03:42:41,351 --> 03:42:49,931
dude that the least confusing things so

5154
03:42:46,899 --> 03:42:52,690
far about Trump being elected is Trump

5155
03:42:49,931 --> 03:42:54,730
getting elected which is confusing in

5156
03:42:52,690 --> 03:42:57,431
its own right but all of the decisions

5157
03:42:54,729 --> 03:42:59,470
he's made sense election might have been

5158
03:42:57,431 --> 03:43:01,239
more confusing than America choosing do

5159
03:42:59,470 --> 03:43:04,000

5160
