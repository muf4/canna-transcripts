25
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,430
took a big fat bag of some super

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,030
delicious chocolate live butter it was

27
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,560
extracted by our friends at CRX I picked

28
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,290

things it's got a great flavor to it

33
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:25,899
I like to weight this battered feels in

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,789
my lungs I know I talked about love and

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,200
Shatter but when you smoke the batter it

36
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,430
kind of expands in your lungs and you

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,820
don't have to smoke as much and you get

38
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,289
a big fat dab Rasta Jeff approved I like

39
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,298

00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,319
about in this podcast let's talk about

44
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:45,819
my breeding project to keep telling you

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,858
about for the past few weeks I've been

46
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,419
updating you about a breeding project it

47
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,890
is just about completed that's right

48
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,969
maybe when I finished this podcast the

49
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,379
lights will have come on and I'll be

50
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:56,048
able to go in the room and I'll see how

51
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,519
much longer we've got to go been pulling

52
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,890
a random seed out every couple of days

53
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,539
to look and see some of them were

54
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,670
getting nice and hard a couple of them

55
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,640
weren't where I wanted them yet so maybe

56
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,780
maybe they're ready today there's some

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,060
new stuff in there I crossed of course

58
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,009
everything was crossed to arise arise is

59
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,210
a golden goat female that was pollinated

60
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:18,399
by a Daybreaker male Daybreaker is Kim D

61
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,700
cross to Joseph oh gee so that makes

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,409
real OG cushy real Kim funky feet kind

63
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:24,759
of smell and traits to it then he put

64
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,829
the golden goat in there it made it kind

65
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,049
of sweet made it kind of tropical it

66
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,659
made it grow bigger and faster so I took

67
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,920
the arize I took a male of the arize put

68
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,449
that in the grow room with a whole bunch

69
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,669
of sexy ladies there's a strawberry

70
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,379
fields in there

71
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,179
that's gonna be brand new I don't have

72
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,250
Strawberry Fields cross to arise until

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,689
now I just made a small tester badge to

74
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,280
check out for myself we'll grow those

75
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,979
see how they go what else is in there

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,870
there is uh there's a grateful dog so we

77
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,759
could make more morning dew seeds there

78
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,340
are a couple of arise females so we can

79
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,870
make more arise f2 seeds there's a

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,879
kosher cushion there that I'm really

81
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,890
excited about I'm gonna make some a rise

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,449
to kosher cush that'll be my new cross

83
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,309
that I'm gonna test out for myself and

84
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,810
see where that goes but I've been

85
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,140
talking a lot about my breeding project

86
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,430
and I'm excited that it is almost done

87
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,779
all right what else should we talk about

88
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,120
yo

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,189
Thursday night I am proud of my city we

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,810
finally hosted a very successful

91
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,159
cannabis event we've had a few small

92
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,539
cannabis events here in this town we

93
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,729
used to do a little smoke out sesh at

94
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,199
the cloud9 hookah bar then one night the

95
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,049
cops came and everyone got paranoid and

96
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,659
nobody showed up after that but we had a

97
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,250
large official smoke event it wasn't a

98
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,419
smokey van it was a cannabis event but

99
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,439
there was no consumption we'll get to

100
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,639
that here in just a minute I'm turned

101
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,259
down the music slowly so I can think

102
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,399
better it's hard to think with all that

103
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,289
music in the headphones

104
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,270
Cinci night we had sensi night here in

105
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,009
Pueblo Colorado on Thursday it was it

106
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,959
the Union Depot which is the old train

107
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,879
station is what it used to be I was a

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,300
big fancy building it was a great event

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,209
everything was done with class there was

110
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,660
not consumption inside the event however

111
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,909
there were three dab buses sponsored by

112
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,439
different companies outside and you were

113
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,699
able to go in one of those buses and

114
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,259
take a DAB if you brought your own you

115
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,389
could smoke your own [ __ ] concentrate in

116
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,829
there excuse me if you did not bring

117
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,839
your own concentrate they had a dab to

118
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,790
offer you in there it was free just hop

119
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,110
on the bus take a little dab the bus was

120
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,060
parked so you weren't going anywhere

121
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,459
the catch is you're not allowed to smoke

122
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,230
in a building like the the Union Depot

123
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,668
that would be illegal to smoke in there

124
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,040
because that's basically a public place

125
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,959
but those dab buses are private property

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,250
so all the windows are blocked out you

127
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,569
can't see in there they check your ID

128
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,160
make sure you're old enough you go up in

129
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,870
there you take a DAB then you come out

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,430
coughing so that was the catch that was

131
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,780
how people were able to medicate of

132
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,459
course if you're Rasta Jeff you've got

133
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,019
your own ways of medicating you

134
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,769
medicated heavily before you left or

135
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,089
perhaps before you walked in but anyway

136
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,219
sensing I think it was a huge success it

137
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:43,229
was a very classy event it was set up

138
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,210
for those of you that don't go to any

139
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,470
cannabis events if you do go to cannabis

140
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,788
events it was just like all the other

141
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,470
events except you couldn't smoke there

142
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,360
if you don't go to events

143
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,920
to basically like a trade show everyone

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,110
sets up their little booths all around

145
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,280
the walls so you walk you mill around in

146
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,810
circles and they build like a little

147
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,609
island in the middle of other booths

148
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,050
that are back to back so you just walk

149
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,850
around and do the laps and check out all

150
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,740
the vendors and all the booths and trade

151
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,090
business cards and pick up free samples

152
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,819
of things they can't give out product

153
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,139
but they can give you samples of like um

154
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,969
maybe people were giving out a lot of

155
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,069
hats and stickers and [ __ ] like that

156
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,260
some of the nutrient companies had small

157
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,310
nutrient samples to give away so stuff

158
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,779
like that they were giving out it was

159
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,980
like most any other trade show that

160
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,459
you'd go to for any other industry

161
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,200
except this was cannabis based for being

162
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,849
a pluggable event I was actually quite

163
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,339
impressed I wasn't sure if I even wanted

164
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,470
to go the always lovely always beautiful

165
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,509
miss Jenny Beth works for a dispensary

166
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,190
and she was she wasn't required to go

167
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,409
but I mean her dispensary asked that she

168
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,610
go and she went and so of course I met

169
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,310
up with her and a couple of her

170
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,020

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,240
around being social had a big smile on

176
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,949
his face I think he might have been high

177
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,269
out of his mind for a little bit but

178
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,949
Mike was there having a good time

179
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,870
everybody from Three Rivers was there

180
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,370
all the management big shout out to miss

181
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,280
Kelly for going to an event I think that

182
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,540
was her first uh industry event of

183
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,250
course Christina was there having a good

184
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,930
time and so I was sitting at home

185
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,129
debating if I wanted to go I was making

186
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,449
myself some food and I was like I might

187
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,728
eat food and I might go down to that

188
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,189
event or I might go take a nap and then

189
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:16,019
uh Mike texted me and he's like you need

190
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,129
to come down here and then Maddy texted

191
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,659
me and she's like you need to come down

192
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,949
here and then miss Jenny was like hey

193
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,000
where are you and I was like you know

194
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,930
what I should put on my shoes and I

195
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,389
should go hang out with all my friends

196
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,418
at the Scentsy party and you know what

197
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,728
I'm really glad I did because I ran into

198
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,769
a lot of friends people that I have

199
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:33,689
known for a long time people that I

200
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:34,978
haven't seen for a long time and then I

201
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,939
bumped into a couple of people that I'd

202
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,459
never met before

203
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,959
and that was a lot of the fun I want to

204
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,449
give a shout out to a guy named Warren I

205
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,728
met Warren right when I walked in and

206
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,959

213
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,149
lot to teach me so I met a lot of new

214
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,219
friends people I'd never met before ran

215
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,239
into all the Pueblo people were there if

216
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,919
you're from Pueblo

217
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,660
and you didn't go you should have gone

218
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,189
because all the local stoners were there

219
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,479
all the people from the dispensaries all

220
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,279

along there was no beef it was a great

223
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,169
time um it was a lot of fun I ran into

224
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:20,879
the legendary Matt Foxx Cooper Watts was

225
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:22,709

226
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,060

227
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,469

231
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,169
party a bunch of great people were there

232
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,478
Vegas from the spot was there getting

233
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:37,978
goofy from with everybody it's a really

234
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,959
good time so big shot at two cents a

235
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,449
night I think it was a huge success

236
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,758
there was no consumption in the building

237
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:48,900
however they were serving alcohol and

238
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,639
around mid 10:30 or 11:00 you could tell

239
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,288
that they were serving alcohol at the

240
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,900
vibe kind of changed people started

241
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:56,848
getting uh they didn't care to represent

242
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:57,719
their brand as much as they did around

243
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:59,908
nine o'clock

244
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,349
I may have stuck around the event a

245
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:02,519
little longer I was getting hungry miss

246
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,228
Jenny Beth was getting hungry it was

247
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,788
time to go but I may have stuck around

248
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:07,348
the event a little longer to see more

249
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:10,050
people and be a little bit more social

250
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:11,699
if there wasn't so much alcohol going on

251
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,960
I could see the vibe changing and I did

252
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,579
not want to stick around to see if

253
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,810
anything was gonna go wrong because

254
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,389
there were a lot of people there and

255
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,860
with that many businesses there could be

256
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,780
rivalries there could be beefs that

257
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,300
nobody even knows about and sometimes

258
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,819
alcohol will light the fire underneath a

259
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,280
beef and some [ __ ] could go wrong so I

260
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,370
left I don't appreciate the alcohol at

261
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,110
the Cannabis events but I get it since

262
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,849
it's an event and it's social I

263
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,800
understand it I just wish that we could

264
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,690
smoke why can we drink alcohol but we

265
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,578
can't smoke in there it's weed in

266
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,860
Colorado we voted to regulate cannabis

267
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,299
like alcohol so they can be in the same

268
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,940
building they get along they're really

269
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,919
good friends I don't understand it

270
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,320
anyway overall since he met was a huge

271
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,360
success I just wish that we could smoke

272
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,430
some dabs in there while the people are

273
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,379
drinking beers seems fair

274
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:59,789
all right you guys I'm going to press

275
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,778

276
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,639
gonna take a drink you can hear my

277
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,110
throat's getting that thing again so

278
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,028

279
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,810

289
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,120
you know I just realized that in the

290
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,708
background you guys may hear some street

291
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,720
racing going on in my neighborhood I

292
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,969
live a few blocks away from a pretty

293
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,879
large street it's a big big open street

294
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,319
and they are street racing like a mofo

295
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,299
out there tonight so if you hear in the

296
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,679
background I do apologize I've got some

297
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,120
software and some equipment that's

298
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,289
trying to cut that out but they're loud

299
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,879
tonight and I can hear it in my

300
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:04,399
headphones which makes me think you guys

301
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,078

302
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,399
run this show through another program

303
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,198
and I'll try to take all that background

304
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,000
noise out but I don't know how well it

305

306
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,899
podcast ladies and gentlemen before I

307
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,899
took a quick break I mentioned that we

308
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,519
were going to read some emails on a

309
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,860
previous episode around Thanksgiving

310
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,690
time I asked you guys to tell me if you

311
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,129
consume cannabis if you smoke some weed

312
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,230
if you took a DAB if you ate some

313
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:29,059
edibles with a family member or somebody

314
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,069
knew or somebody that you haven't smoked

315
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,869
or consumed with in a long time I wanted

316
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:35,328
to hear about your Thanksgiving family

317
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,370
cannabis experience I got a couple of

318
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:39,138
responses I printed out one to read on

319
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,909
the show tonight I'm pulling it out of

320
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,680
the pile of papers and it goes like this

321
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,250
this is hi my name and address and I'm

322
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,989

324
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,740
said I'll remain anonymous right at the

325
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,300
top of the paper and it says you asked

326
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,680
for your listeners to share if they

327
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,169
smoked with the new relative on

328
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,938
Thanksgiving and I absolutely did for

329
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,719
the first time ever I shared a bowl with

330
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,159
my mom

331
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,079
well congratulations man that's super

332
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,389
cool they go on to say we had a blast

333
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,818
and she over shared quite a lot about

334
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,528
her newfound dating experiences I never

335
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,419
thought it would happen but I'm a little

336
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,990
jealous of my mom's sex life so there

337
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,059
you go

338
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,759
peace out and I actually did take a fat

339
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:17,508
dab and I gave my mom a hug well a quick

340
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,039
awkward hug signed no-name a no-name

341
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,629
thanks for the great response I really

342
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,909
like that you uh you finally smoked a

343
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,828
bowl with your mom and I think it's

344
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,389
funny I kind of apologized but I'm kind

345
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:28,099
of grinning funny at you that you had to

346
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,980
hear about your mom's newfound dating

347
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,449
experiences I find it super awkward that

348
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,129
you're jealous of your mom's sex life

349
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:36,620
that means you need to step up your game

350
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,549
but anyway I'm glad that you got to

351
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,839
smoke

352
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,278
down with mom that's always a great

353
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,649
thing I haven't smoked with my mom in

354
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:44,360
quite a long time she used to go to

355
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,399
concerts and stuff with me we still do

356
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,680
[ __ ] together but now she's uh she's got

357
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,690
a job that does drug testing and so she

358
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,750
just can't smoke and also she's clumsy

359
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,040
as [ __ ] so she's just got that kind of

360
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,929
luck that she would smoke a joint with

361
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,789
me just to celebrate something silly and

362
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,019
just the next day she would pick up a

363
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,309
cotton ball and it would cut the [ __ ]

364
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,600
out of her because my mom is clumsy she

365
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,889
could hurt herself with a bag of cotton

366
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,420
balls I don't know how she could do it

367
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,919
but she can but so I've been smoked with

368
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,019
my mom in ages but we used to get down a

369
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,370
long long time ago my mom's kind of a

370
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,019
lightweight it should take 1 or 2 puffs

371
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,669
she's like the new weed is too strong

372
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,990
she take like one or two hits off with a

373
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:17,389
good weed and she'd just be [ __ ]

374
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,039
wrecked it'd be so funny but years and

375
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,328
years years like a hundred years ago my

376
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,679
mom and I smoked weed I think the last

377
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:23,629
time we smoked was at a Tom Petty

378
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,049
it's probably a Tom Petty concert at Red

379
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,909
Rocks so shout out to moms anyway to my

380
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,049
my listener dude I'm glad you got to

381
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:31,578
smoke with your mom keep that bond

382
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,828
strong all right I'm gonna move into

383
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:36,289
another email this one's got a different

384
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:37,939
tone I don't think this one needs much

385
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,669
introduction everything is here and the

386
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,680
message was well done I goes like this

387
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,028
first off love your podcast I found it a

388
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,979
couple of weeks ago and I've just been

389
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:47,240
devouring episodes whenever I get a

390
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,190
chance I've been learning some great

391
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,680
things and it's been really helpful my

392
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,750
favorite so far was episode 252 on

393
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,609
topping as like most growers do

394
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,799
sometimes I was nervous about topping my

395
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,810
girls too low or too high that same day

396
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,189
well so far thanks for the compliment

397
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:03,289
dude I'm glad I was able to help you out

398
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,440
with episode 252 I'm glad you find me

399
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,819
helpful then the email goes on like this

400
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,310
it says I think you should consider

401
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,839
revisiting episode 264 with someone who

402
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,609
has more organic based growing

403
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,040
experience and have a serious debate

404
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,169
about the pros and cons of synthetic vs.

405
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,208
organics I was hoping to glean some

406
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,099
useful info for comparisons and ways the

407
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,958
two can work together but I couldn't

408
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,720
even get through the episode because it

409
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:29,328
was so biased against organics I think I

410
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,009
started out as a bottle grower myself so

411
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:32,809
I definitely know that they have their

412
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,189
advantages but I've been making the

413
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,719
switch to organics because I was

414
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,370
starting to feel like a mad scientist

415
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,800
with all the bottles charts and mixing

416
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,839
times etc I've been able to simplify a

417
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,759
lot of things saved money and traded

418
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,709
time spent mixing notes for spending

419
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,750
time enjoying my plants and the garden I

420
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,399
worked so hard to put together it was a

421
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,379
little frustrating to hear such a great

422
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,568
resource steer so many growers toward

423
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,819
direction when we need all the honest

424
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:57,318
unbiased information we can get in a

425
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:59,139
market where companies are eager to

426
00:13:57,318 --> 00:14:02,688
profit off of people's lack of knowledge

427
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,399
Clackamas coud tad Hussey and tad Hesse

428
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:06,618
of the cannabis cultivation and science

429
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,629
podcast or Nelson Lindley who grows a

430
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:10,668
mix of organic and said synthetic are

431
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,470
all great knowledgeable resources that I

432
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:14,629
think would be happy to discuss with you

433
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,609
if you reached out just a thought

434
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,798
keep up the great work and stay black

435
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:20,479
eyed pretty sure that's a Joey Diaz

436
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:22,639
reference so I will stay black

437
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,538
[ __ ] and if that's a Joey Diaz

438
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,188
reference I'm not calling you a

439
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:28,038
[ __ ] idle line it's a compliment

440
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:29,658
god damn it ah but anyway I hope you're

441
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:31,188
a Joey Diaz fan cuz that doesn't make

442
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:33,918
sense if not anyway let's get back to

443
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:35,448
email get serious here um I appreciate

444
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,369
this I know you're calling me out and

445
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:39,019
saying I gave a biased opinion on my on

446
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,678
my podcast when I did what I tried to do

447
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,028
was a fair debate

448
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,288
I appreciate this I'm not taking this

449
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,428
personally I'm taking it personally but

450
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,288
I'm not taking it as an attack

451
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:48,858
personally I'm taking this as proper

452
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:51,078
guidance my thing was uh I am a bottled

453
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:52,849
synthetic grower so I of course I lean

454
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,738
that way I tried to do it unbiased

455
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:57,528
obviously I failed at that so thank you

456
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:58,819
for pointing it out um if you're in

457

help me out I honestly clack admit makes

465
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,749
me nervous you know so much about

466
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,459
cannabis he's just gonna come blow my

467
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:17,689
mind but I would love to have him on the

468
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,608
other two folks I'm not sure who they

469
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:21,528
are but I am aware of Clackamas coot

470
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:23,089
another thing you said you only listen

471
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:24,369
to halfway through the episode you

472
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,199
didn't hear the end where I said that

473
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:28,100
organic growers are gonna win because at

474
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,408
the end of the world

475
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,879
we don't have bottles when the end of

476
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:33,408
the world scenario comes whatever that

477
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,999
is I always try to think like that I'm

478
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:37,068
kind of a paranoid hippie shit's gonna

479
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:38,359
go down dude I don't know what it is but

480
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,558
some shits gonna go down and one day

481
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,908
you're not gonna have a grow light and

482
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:43,009
you're not gonna have a bottled nutrient

483
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,149
so I think that in that case your

484
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,318
organic farmers are gonna win because

485
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,759
they know how to farm they know how to

486
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:49,188
grow everything if they know how to grow

487
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,449
cannabis organically indoors they could

488
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:52,668
do it all natural the under the Sun

489
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,988
they're gonna win so I wish you would

490
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:56,749
have listened to the whole episode that

491
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:58,129
may have helped you out but um I do

492
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,019
agree that maybe I was a little bit

493
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,000
biased because that's my experience I

494
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,799
can't I I tried

495
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,840
keep it fair but obviously I missed it a

496
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,289
little bit so I apologize for [ __ ] it

497
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,060
up and not getting a fair episode like I

498
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,740
should have done so if anybody out there

499
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,179
would like to come and do a friendly

500
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,169
debate I want to open this up and keep

501
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,549
it going I want to keep this

502
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,379
conversation happening

503
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:20,689
I think this email just sparked even

504
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,919
more of a debate if you want to come on

505
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,110
and keep it friendly I don't want you to

506
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,899
if you are on Team organics or on Team

507
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,340
salts or on Team organics plus salts you

508
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,350
can't come on my show and bash the

509
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,080
opposite but you can come and tell me

510
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,820
the pros and cons that you feel are why

511
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,500
you do what you do so if you want to

512
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,970
have a friendly debate if you're in the

513
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,320
southern Colorado area I've got gear

514
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,360
that I can come to you I've got a zoom

515
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,700
h6 that fits in my pocket I can carry

516
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,629
all my [ __ ] my hoodie if I need to drive

517
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,210
up to you I got to get the car fixed

518
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,230
that's another story but once you get

519
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,460
the car fixed I can drive right up to

520
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,570
you we can have this debate wherever you

521
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,580
are if you're in the southern Colorado

522
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,170
maybe Denver area make some time I'd

523
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,970
love to have this conversation maybe one

524
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,559
two maybe three other people we could

525
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,540
talk about organics versus synthetics

526
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,549
all together now we can make it a fair

527
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,750
debate if you guys want to put me in

528
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,338
touch with these folks that I just

529
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,490
mentioned in the email Clackamas coot

530
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:09,948
tad hussy or Nelson Lindley

531
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,939
I would not be opposed to you guys

532
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,259
putting me in touch with them

533
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,150
I'll keep this email sitting on the top

534
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:16,039
of the pile here so I can research those

535
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,890
names heed the person that sent me this

536
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,029
did you put a name on here I'm not gonna

537
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,949
call it your name your names on the top

538
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,000
of your email hmm you should correct

539
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,930
that if you don't want people to know

540
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,328
your name because it says your full name

541
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,820
up there ah but I do appreciate the

542
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,500
email and uh thank you for the

543
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:32,929
constructive criticism and pointing out

544
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,069
that I kind of [ __ ] that up and maybe go

545
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,900
back and listen to the second half just

546
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:38,149
so that you can hear that I tried my

547
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,700
best man I really did I I'm not on

548
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,320
either team I just I use one so I have

549
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,539
much I have more to say about the other

550
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,339
it's like if I try to tell you about I

551
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,440
don't know ask me about my iPhone and

552
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,789
ask me about your iPhone I don't know I

553
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,779
know the basics of yours but once you

554
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,980
get to the apps and [ __ ] I don't know

555
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,960
what you got I know everything that's in

556
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,700
my phone been doing it I don't know your

557
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,190
phone so I I can only tell you so much

558
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,049
about your phone it's an iPhone it's got

559
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,000
a case on it glass screen you know what

560
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,349
I mean just like mine does but I know so

561
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,609
many more details about my ex I'm doing

562
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,769
that so maybe that's why I seem biased

563
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,569
and I apologize if anybody else out

564
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,700
there has any input or has any

565
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:12,859
complaints about any other episode I'd

566
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,299
love to hear you guys I think I just

567
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:16,159
showed that I can take criticism well

568
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:18,049
and it's gonna make me a better

569
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,060
a podcaster a better teacher a better

570
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,349
grower and I'm trying to move everybody

571
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,659
forward together so you guys are moving

572
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,129

573
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,240
like this I'm not afraid of it I'm a

574
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,490
grown-ass man I can take constructive

575
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,930
criticism bring it please so thanks

576
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,940

577
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,060
you want me to see your name let's move

578
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,320
forward into the next email this one I'm

579
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,899
looking to see if they've got their name

580
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,939
on here then to done I see their name

581
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,470
right there but no [ __ ] starts the

582
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,110
name like this hello my name is Anthony

583
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,250
I have basically zero experience growing

584
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,929
cannabis but I want to try

585
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,150
I've been reading tons and listening

586
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,250
exclusively to your grow show I have

587
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,320
some seeds from what I assume is Mexican

588
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,390
brick weed a sativa I'm guessing i've

589
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,250
sprouted several seeds i pulled off from

590
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,440
this stuff and it shoots up brother I

591
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,059
have heard that all these problems stem

592
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,100
from poor white I was always saying it's

593
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,839
just shooting straight up I hear all

594
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:07,399
these problems stem from poor light or

595
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,529
could it be that it's just the strain

596
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,330
the real question I guess I'm asking is

597
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,670
if the light isn't the problem could it

598
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,409
just be tall as plants I'm indoor

599
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,100
growing on a low-budget do-it-yourself

600
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,259
grow box

601
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:20,299
I've run on a post these stems okay I'm

602
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,690
gonna stop right here yes you need more

603
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:27,019
light the thing that plants want the

604
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,269
most is light its lights and then maybe

605
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:31,700
next is either water or air and then

606
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:33,589
they need some dirt I don't do that mine

607
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,150
that's not science but that's plants

608
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,799
need light light is the number one thing

609
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,810
that plants grow off of and then water

610
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,129
and air those are the three things you

611
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,200
need them without those things you can't

612
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,060
have a plant but light keeps that plant

613
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,380
alive you got to feed that plant as much

614
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,269
light as you can give it or they're just

615
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,190
gonna stretch especially seedlings I

616
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,650
like to get the light really close to

617
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,170
the seedlings keep it right on them keep

618
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,330
I give them some T fives let's set the

619
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,039
row eight T fives right on top of that

620
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,539
seedling tour it's about maybe six or

621
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,849
eight inches above it and it's just

622
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,769
getting illuminated and I do it for 18

623
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:05,539
hours maybe 24 hours a day and the

624
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,859
seedlings just get them started super

625
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,879
strong so if they're stretching up if

626
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,259
they're shooting up real tall that's

627
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,330
called getting leggy in the weed world

628
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:13,460
um they're stretching they're trying to

629
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:14,809
get to the light another thing they need

630
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,309
a fan on them if they're growing that

631
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,539
fast you if you they're growing that

632
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,769
fast and you put some wind on them

633
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,789
you'll at least make them strengthen

634
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,650
themselves up they'll get a little

635
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:23,809
stronger but you need more light you

636
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,790
need to get more light and the plants

637
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,289
need to be closer to more light that's

638
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,909
you're obviously the problem just from

639
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,730
what you've described it is not the

640
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,140
strain

641
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,610
you put under that condition without

642
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,320
enough light is going to stretch it's

643
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:35,939
gonna shoot up like that things you've

644
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,519
said indicate that you need more light

645
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,309
so I'm gonna keep going it says where

646
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,349
was I did today I'm in it growing on a

647
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,000
bud I've read that these pas that I've

648
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:46,740
read on a post that these stems can be

649
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,470
planted deeper and will develop roots

650
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,059
does that make them a longer tap root

651
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,130
does that make the stem a longer tap

652
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,450
root I'm not necessarily making so

653
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,890
you're talking about taking this plant

654
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,900
that's too leggy putting it in a larger

655
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,370
pot digging a deep hole burying it so

656
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,480
let's say your plant has grown 8 inches

657
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,339
you want to bury it down to where you've

658
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,670
only got 3 inches sticking out that is

659
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:07,230
effective but you can also overwater and

660
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,000
kill the plant doing that but it will

661
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,799
work it will help you out it doesn't

662
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,869
make a longer tap root necessarily it

663
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,269
just makes the stem buried deeper but

664
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:16,500
it's the same same idea but no because

665
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,970
the tap root developed away at the

666
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,410
bottom there and grew out so you just

667
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,390
make you're just burying it deeper which

668
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,580
works I will do that occasionally

669
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,020
if I start off my plants in a cup or a

670
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,789
small pot and they over grow that and

671
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,200
they get a little too big I'll cut off

672
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,940
some of the bottom branches and bury

673
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,860
them a little deeper in a 3 or 7 gallon

674
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,140
pot before I flip them and that does

675
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,719
help so they're more of the email will

676
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,190
the plant get more oxygen then um no

677
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,319
won't get more oxygen than your barring

678
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,830
it will get less oxygen will it ruin my

679
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,929
plant

680
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:44,909
if you overwater it if you buried it too

681
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,500
hard if you bury it too tight if you

682
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,600
don't put it in good soil if your rough

683
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,799
about it yes you can ruin your plant the

684
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,259
plants are very delicate when they're

685
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,279
that small you can touch it and break it

686
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:55,069
in half when it's that little

687
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,450
so you got to be super super careful

688
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:59,759
then you say this is costing me nothing

689
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,860
out of pocket so I can take the chance a

690
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,660
short segment of leggy seedlings or

691
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,099
whatever you think may help me and

692
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,630
others like me would be super awesome um

693
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,099
so we see he said a short segment on

694
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,330
leggy seedlings or whatever you think

695
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,519
may help some others like me would be

696
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:15,720
super awesome yeah I'm glad to help you

697
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,420
out man I'm gonna kind of do that right

698
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,860
now so if it's costing you nothing and

699
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,390
your ceilings are that stretchy and

700
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,369
you've got more from that Mexican brick

701
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,080
weed I would recommend starting more and

702
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:27,509
cuz right now you're already starting

703
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,889
off with a struggle it's if you've got

704
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:30,420
free seeds out of that brick wheat if

705
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,790
you have more start more of them dude

706
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,580
just start more and then get more light

707
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:36,839
put more light closer to your seedlings

708
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:39,269
that's why your seedlings are stretching

709
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,029
put them in under either like a t5 or

710
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,379
underneath like a 250 watt high pressure

711
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,899
sodium or

712
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,010
a 250 watt Hal I don't know if they make

713
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,230
that I've never seen that I've never

714
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:51,089
tried to buy that or underneath a 400

715
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,279
watt halide lamp and then just put it

716
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:55,409
kind of close not don't let it burn them

717
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,059
but you want them to get plenty of light

718
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,340
and you want it to be kind of warm and

719
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,230
you want to put a light light fan on

720
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,119
them not hard with the fan you want to

721
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,759
move the air and as they grow and then

722
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,989
start increasing the fan so that's a way

723
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,180
to get them a little stronger

724
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,470
but if you've got plenty more start more

725
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,420
to throw the shitty ones away and start

726
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,680
fresh if you can especially if they're

727
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,810
free especially if it didn't cost you

728
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,220
anything don't be in a hurry start right

729
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,569
you don't want to start with a struggle

730
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,400
that sucks just starting off with

731
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,109
problems you could just go back and fix

732
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,640
it now and have a better start you'll

733
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,250
blow up the old one and build any one

734
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,100
mm-hmm so I guess that is my short

735
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,710
segment on leggy seedlings get the light

736
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,569
closer use the proper soil I hate to

737
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,519
advertise it kind of soil but if you're

738
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:36,809
new and you need a cheap light fluffy

739
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,299
soil that you can go out and just drop

740
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,059
some seedlings in light warrior from Fox

741
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,829
farms will work just fine they're not

742
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,990
I'm not advertising for them it just

743
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:47,789
works it's easy you can go buy it it's

744
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,069
available at almost every hydroponic

745
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:51,809
store just go get yourself some light

746
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:53,849
warrior if you're an experienced grower

747
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,589
you can figure it out I bet what kind of

748
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,539
soil to use if you don't want to use the

749
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:59,159
light warrior if you know why you don't

750
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,569
want to use light warrior you know what

751
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,390
to get that's what I think I'm trying to

752
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,619
say there's just it's not there's

753
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,730
nothing wrong with white warrior just

754
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:07,019
some more experienced growers would

755
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,880
prefer other stuff but it will work

756
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,329
great for you if you're if that's what

757
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,250
you need

758
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:13,500
it'll do it so go get yourself some

759
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,059
white warrior soil go to the grouse

760
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,250
store and get a t5 light if you're gonna

761
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,899
grow some stuff get the proper stuff put

762
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,670
it under some good lights put it under a

763
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,440
t5 light maybe the short one the little

764
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,170
18-inch long one I don't know how long

765
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,880
they are like 18 24 inches you don't

766
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,380
need the big 3-foot by whatever one get

767
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,380
the one with like the four bulbs in it

768
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,880
put a few a few cups of the light

769
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,710
warrior soil in there and put the plants

770
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,850
into the dirt and then let them pop up

771
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,110
like that and then see how they grow

772
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,399
then you'll see the difference if you

773
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,959
keep that light close they'll start

774
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,100
pushing out and then you'll have to

775
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,259
transplant them pretty soon and they

776
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,399
don't need a bigger light and then

777
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,529
you'll have to flower I mean you'll need

778
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,940
a bigger light so yeah I have not list

779
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,160
all of your podcast yet so I'm not sure

780
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,990
if it's something you have covered yet I

781
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,810
listen to them at work on headphones

782
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,430
while I'm trimming trees in Missouri man

783
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,359
that sounds like it could be so much fun

784
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,740
sometimes

785
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,029
and I'm not even being a smartass

786
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,400
sometimes I just want to go outside

787
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,869
we've got a big roll up garage door at

788
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,519
the grow that we bring pallets in when

789
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,409
we get deliveries and [ __ ] we'd bring

790
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,970
the scissor lift in through there we

791
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,320
bring the forklift in through there and

792
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,569
sometimes when that thing opens up I'm

793
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,429
like lalalalala outside I just want to

794
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:15,509
go play cement sometimes would be

795
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,890
awesome just to be out there trimming

796
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:18,450
trees with you in Missouri with the

797
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,060
headphones on not dealing with people

798
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,440
that'd be so rad anyway he says keep up

799
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,839
the awesomeness and I appreciate your

800
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,539
helping the grow community both very big

801
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,899
and very small and going off to hug my

802
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:32,639
mom signed Anthony P hey man thank you

803
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,110
for the great email thanks for the great

804
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,990
question about seeds I hope I can help

805
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:39,359
you out basically more light and closer

806
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,039
if you can uh don't if you can put your

807
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,059
hand in the light where the seeds are

808
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,399
put your hand right at the top of the

809
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,750
seedlings and it should feel warm but

810
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,820
not hot you should just be able to leave

811
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,170
your hand there it should be warm but

812
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,639
not hot it should be comfortable ooh

813
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,660
that's nice and you just want to leave

814
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,460
your hand there that that's what the

815
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,930
plant wants to it just wants to get a

816
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,860
nice little suntan just wants to kick it

817
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,500
it does want to get cooked

818
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,059
I just wants to feel warm so they'll

819
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,329
like closer get more light on it

820
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,740
everything will work just fine one thing

821
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,819
I would be concerned about though if you

822
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,079
don't have enough light for seedlings

823
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,419
you're not gonna have enough light to

824
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,799
flower plants so it's gonna be time to

825
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,450
start thinking about bigger better

826
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,190
lights and more space and getting all

827
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,380
that ahead of yourself instead of having

828
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,180
those seedlings stuck under a small

829
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,590
space and not be prepared so start

830
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,299
getting that planned out before we start

831
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:23,220
