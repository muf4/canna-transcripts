mother. Yeah. Welcome back podcast

5
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,079
world. I'm your host Rosta Jeff. This is

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,160

dgccup.com for all of the updated info.

45
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,478
They have moved the event this year. The

46
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,639
new venue looks like a beautiful place.

47
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,239
I will be there for the VIP party Friday

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,359
night. I will be there for the Saturday

49
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,639
DGC cup. And uh we are attending and

50
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,439

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,759
So come say hi at the DGCup. Make sure

52
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,120

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480

55
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,878
course, I will be giving you more

56
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,119
advertising and details about the cup as

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,560
the show approaches. All right, that is

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
all of the advertising. We made it

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
through the the advertising portion of

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
the podcast. Let's jump into the fun

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
part of today's podcast. Of course, that

62
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,799
is the question and answer portion of

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
the show. This is how people get free

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
seeds. Of course, at the start of the

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
show, I said we're going to give away

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,920
free seeds. How do you get those free

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,719
seeds? I have a website. My website is

68
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,799
iiegenetics.com. At the top of that

69
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,959
website, there is a row of tabs. One of

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
those tabs does say grow help. Maybe it

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,000
says grow questions. You're going to

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
figure it out when you get there. Click

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
on that tab. Guess what? You get to send

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
me a grow question. If I read your grow

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
question here on the podcast, I will

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,200
send you a coupon code for free seeds

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,039
from ire redirect.com. Today's first

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,119
question came from somebody who wants to

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,318
be called Cody. Big shout out to my new

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,560
friend Cody. Cody is asking a question

81
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,479
uh that pops up quite often in this

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,158
business, this industry, this community.

83
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
Uh, this question is sent to me quite

84
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,239
often. I try not to, uh, let this one

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
fire me up too much. I try to answer

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,158
this, uh, maybe twice a year because the

87
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,679
people do ask this a lot. This one

88
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
drives me a little bit crazy. I used to

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
do pet peeves on the show. Uh, this is

90
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,199
sort of a pet peeve of mine, but I'm

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,719
going to make clarity out of this. The

92
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,079
question from Cody. And Cody, make sure

93
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,598
you check your inbox, my dude, because

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
you've got a coupon code for a free pack

95
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,719
of seeds. Also, check your spam because

96
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,719
a lot of email services think that my

97
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,400
gift cards are spam for some reason.

98
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,519
Check your spam, you guys. Anyway, the

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,158
question goes like this. It says,

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,239
"Howdy, sir." Howdy, sir. It says, "I

101
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,759
enjoy your show and the way you explain

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,799
things." Well, thank you. I appreciate

103
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,399
that. It says, "You make it easier to

104
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,159
digest." Uh, that's part of my goal. I

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
am passionately curious and I love

106
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,120
learning, but for some reason, I hated

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,158
school. I hated going at that teacher's

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,080
slow, boring [ __ ] pace. Uh, I hated

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,239
learning the same [ __ ] over and over for

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,159
four weeks when I learned it a week ago.

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,158
Um, so I try to make it to where you

112
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,679
guys are having fun. Uh, I try to tell a

113
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,879
joke every now and then, but I try to

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
get straight to the point and tell you

115
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,319
what you need to know, but I also try to

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
tell you in multiple ways because people

117
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,918
learn in different ways. Some are visual

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,918
learners. Uh, some people have to touch

119
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,758
things. Uh, I have a way that I can kind

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,439
of draw a picture of [ __ ] with my words

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
and show you how to do it. Some people

122
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,240
learn in different ways, and I'm trying

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,478
to get it to everybody, get that info

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,000
out, and not overload you. So, uh, thank

125
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,240
you for noticing that, uh, I make it

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
easier to digest. I do appreciate that.

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,439
I also don't try to overload you. Some

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,960
people will be like, "The answer is

129
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,839
nitrogen, but then also phosphorus and

130
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,959
potassium, and the answer, nitrogen

131
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,638
would have gotten you there. I didn't

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,959
need to overload you with shit." I try

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,478
to be conscious of that. It goes on.

134
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,319
There's a lot going on here. It says,

135
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,959
"I've never been able to find a real

136
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,279
answer on this question. Let's say you

137
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,198
have a plant that is a 10e flower. Does

138
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,918
that 10 week start as soon as I switch

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
to 1212 or does it start after stretch

140
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,198
and you get the puff balls?" Thank you

141
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,399
for your time. Have a great day. All

142
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,680
right. So, I jumped right into the

143
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,638
question part there. The question came

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,959
up. The question is, um, if I have a 10

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,918
week flowering strain, does that 10

146
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,359
weeks start the day I switch to 1212 or,

147
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,359
and I'm not even going to read the or

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,479
because why or? Why are we putting a

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,120
[ __ ] algebra equation to this? When

150
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,560
you are growing cannabis plants, day one

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
of flower begins the day you change the

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,600
timer to 1212. That is day one of

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,439
flower. You just initiated the flowering

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
cycle. You just change that timer. That

155
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,079
is day one. No ifs, ants, buts,

156
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,560
questions, substitutes, whatifs, how

157
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,758
comes. That is it. That is day one. You

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
don't wait until some other [ __ ]

159
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
happens. You don't wait until you start

160
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,360
to see this person said puffballs or

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
pistols. Do not wait for that. That is

162
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,000
not day one. Day one was the day you

163
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,359
flipped the timer. Uh I didn't write on

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,439
the package uh 70 days minus 2 weeks

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
plus 3 days plus 4 days from when you

166
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,879
last water. I didn't do any of that on

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
there. It says 70 days of flower. So,

168
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,360
when I wrote 70 days on the package,

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,039
that is 70 days from the day you turn

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,639
the timer to 1212. So, day one is the

171
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,199
day you flip the timer. It always will

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,038
be, always has been. Um, the last time I

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,439
did this episode, I got comments that

174
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,519
said, "Why do you get to decide that?

175
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,120
Why do I get to decide that? I made the

176
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,198
[ __ ] seeds. I printed the [ __ ]

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,319
packages. I know that. I didn't decide

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,199
it. Uh, I grew the I bred these seeds. I

179
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
grew them. I noticed takes me 70 days to

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,720
flower these in my rooms. I sent them

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,360
out to other people. Those people said

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
somewhere between 65 and 75 days. I said

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
the average of that 70 days. So I wrote

184
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
that on the package. That's how I know.

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,399
That's why I get to decide. I made the

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
[ __ ] seeds. I'm the breeder. I'm the

187
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,359
the proprietor of this company. I wrote

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,439
that on the package because I have

189
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
tested these plants. I've ran them a lot

190
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,959
of times. Other people have ran them.

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,120
And we've determined that on average in

192
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,879
most rooms, in most cases, those plants

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
are going to take 60 to 70 days to

194
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,800
finish. Uh why do we start the flower

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,879
timer on day one as day one? Because

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
that's when day one is. Why would you

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,680
wait till you see puff balls? Because

198
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,679
other people are going to see puff those

199
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,478
puff balls are going to appear day 12,

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,639
day 17. Now you're 5 days, you're 5 days

201
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,478
off schedule. Why would just do it the

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
day you flip the timer. Uh there's no

203
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,918
algebra to be done here. There's no

204
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,159
math. There's no questions. Day one is

205
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,159
day one. When you flip the timer, that

206
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,599
is day one. Write it the [ __ ] down. Get

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
a calendar. Write it down. Make a note

208
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,680
in your phone. I flipped this room on

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,598
this date in my calendar app in my

210
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,439
phone. I'll open it up right now. Um, it

211
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,120
shows I've got multiple environments and

212
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,918
different places going on. So, let's

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
see. The 7th was week three in my main

214
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,399
room. The 14th will be week four. And

215
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,079
then I've just got the 28th is week six.

216
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,839
I just went through April and every

217
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,758
Monday since I started my plants on a

218
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,119
Monday on that Monday, I just went

219
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
through and marked the calendar one

220
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
through whatever. I go all the way up to

221
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,839
week 10. Uh, sometimes I flower 11

222
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,399
weeks, but I don't I won't need that

223
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,119
note at that far. But I mark it in the

224
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,519
calendar. Room 1, tent A, flowered, and

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
it's at [ __ ] Today is the 12th. So

226
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,758
the 7th was the beginning of week three.

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,878
We're halfway through work three. Uh I'm

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
stuttering, but yeah, we're about to

229
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,039
catch up and begin week four. So mark

230
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,758
that note. Um and then something else to

231
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,079
pay attention to those numbers on those

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
packs. Like I said before, I ran that

233
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,719
plant. I ran those seeds and most of

234
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,800
those seeds took 65 to 75 days to

235
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
flower. So I marked that [ __ ] pack 70

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
days. That is the average what you're

237
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,639
going to get. There will be outliers.

238
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
Um, I saw a great quote on the internet.

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,038
I can't even. Guppy said it. Guppy said,

240
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,879
uh, I wrote 70 days on that pack.

241
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,360
However, the plants didn't read that

242
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,759
note. Some of those plants may take 75.

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
Some of them may take 85 days. There are

244
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,439
outliers within phenotypes. There are

245
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
outliers within packages. There are

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
outliers in population is the word I'm

247
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
looking for. Uh, most of those seeds are

248
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,599
going to finish at the 70-day mark for

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
you. Some of them may finish at day 60.

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Some may finish at day 80. The bulk of

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
them, 75 to 80% of them will be done in

252
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
70 days is why I put that on the

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
package. You're going to have outliers

254
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,559
based on uh genetics. There's going to

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,639
be outliers just genetically. Things are

256
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,719
going to be uh that's how genetics work.

257
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,080
Also, your environment will make a

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
difference. The kind of light, the

259
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
intensity of light, the hours of light,

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,759
the spectrum of the light. Uh that's

261
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,919
going to make a difference. Your VPD

262
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,519
will make a difference. Your soil will

263
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,759
make a difference. Your feeding will

264
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
make a difference. And possibly, if you

265
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,039
really want to get hippie- dippy about

266
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
it, I have no proof of this, but the

267
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
moon and the sun and the seasons will

268
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
have an effect on your indoor plants as

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
well. So, all of those things could have

270
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,839
an effect. Um, so the let's jump right

271
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,519
back to it. Uh, when is day one is the

272
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,680
basic of this question. When is day one?

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,679
If you have a 10e plant, uh, it says 10

274
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,439
weeks on the package. Uh, does that 10

275
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,000
start as soon as I switch? Yes, that

276
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,160
starts as soon as you switch. So that

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,080
first short night, that is day one. That

278
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,838
time that it goes into 1212, that's day

279
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,360
one. Start counting from that point. Um,

280
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
dude, I really think I answered your

281
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
question and then some. So my dude Cody,

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560

291
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
going. I'm not going to slow it down.

292
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,360
We're going to jump right into the next

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,560
question. This one came from It doesn't

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,879
have their name that they want to be

295
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,879
called on it. Uh but I'm going to send

296
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,399
you a pack of seeds anyway. Uh we're

297
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,240
just going to call you Tina. Tina, thank

298
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,078
you for the great question. It says, "I

299
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
have a question about light leaks in a

300
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,719
grow tent." Which is a very good

301
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,839
question. Um, is growing outside, wait,

302
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
is growing outside more superior than

303
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,200
indoor? Does the moon affect the

304
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
cannabis like a light leak would? So,

305
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
that's a very good question. I will

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
reread this and make it make a little

307
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,679
more sense for you. Uh, thank you for

308
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,839
what you bring information to everybody.

309
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,759
I've learned a lot. I love to listen.

310
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
Thank you again, Tina. Thank you for the

311
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,000
great question. What Tina is basically

312
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,240
asking, I always talk about how light

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
leaks are very important in an indoor

314
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
grow environment. They're important to

315
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
not have light leaks. What do I mean by

316
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
a light leak? That's a whole new uh

317
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,799
thing to open up there. A light leak.

318
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,480
When we're growing cannabis, we have a

319
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,120
dark period. That night period, the

320
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,278
sleeping period, that period cannot be

321
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,360
interrupted by light. That dark period

322
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,320
needs to be completely dark for 12

323
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,560
hours. Zero light. No light at all. Not

324
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
a light on a uh like if you have an air

325
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,838
conditioner or if you have some sort of

326
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,000
monitoring device, if there's a light on

327
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,120
there, that light counts. We don't want

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,958
that light. A light leak is when that

329
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,278
darkness is interrupted. Let's say

330
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,879
you've got a tent and a flap comes open

331
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,639
and light gets in there. Light has now

332
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,559
leaked into your environment. Light

333
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,159
leaks do cause problems in grows. They

334
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,159
can lead to interex traits. They can

335
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,399
slow your plants down from growing. Uh

336
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,879
light leaks can be very detrimental. So

337
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,519
my new friend Tina is asking um

338
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,838
basically uh if we're growing outside,

339
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
why doesn't the moon affect these

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
plants? Why don't we get light leaks

341
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
from the moon? And also we're going to

342
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,958
touch on like things like street lights.

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,560
We're going to touch on uh cars passing

344
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,879
by, uh planes flying by, helicopters,

345
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,319
um porch lights, just lights like that.

346
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,559
We're going to include that in this

347
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
topic here. So keep in mind I don't have

348
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,399
any notes. This is all coming out of

349
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,039
memory. Uh nothing here to give me a

350
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,919
guide on this answer. The answer is the

351
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,919
short answer is phytochrome and far red

352
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,319
lighting. That is the short answer. So

353
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,399
let me explain. Outdoors in an outdoor

354
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
grow environment. Our plants are outside

355
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,078
getting sunshine all day, right? They're

356
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,439
getting beat by sunshine. The first

357
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,199
factor here is that sunlight is way more

358
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
powerful than any grow light you will

359
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
ever imagine, any grow light you could

360
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,320
ever buy. It's the perfect spectrum.

361
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,559
It's the most intense thing that there

362
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,160
is. And it's natural. That is what the

363
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,759
plants are intuitively, instinctively,

364
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,000
primordial, whatever it is. That is the

365
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,679
thing that makes those plants go, "Yes,

366
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,958
that is the main thing for plants." And

367
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,638
they know it. So when they're out there

368
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,799
in the sunshine, they're getting exactly

369
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
what they need and it's a way different

370
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,838
feeding than the little grow light in

371
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
your house. That's barely a light

372
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
compared to the sun. So that's something

373
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,039
to keep in mind as we delve down this

374
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,320
journey here. Another thing to think

375
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,559
about, as the sun is setting outdoors,

376
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,600
it begins to put off a spectrum that

377
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,759
becomes red in the color spectrum as it

378
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
sets. Uh I can't tell you exactly how

379
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,838
this happens, but I know it does. Just

380
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,680
trust me. As the sun sets, it begins to

381
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,399
put off a red spectrum because of its

382
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,759
angle in the sky. Now, that spectrum

383
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,600
puts off a far red spectrum of lighting.

384
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,039
The color of lighting is far red. You

385
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
can't see it with your eye, but if you

386
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,519
have meters and understand that color is

387
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,919
far red lighting. Now, that far red

388
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,720
light tells that plant, it triggers in

389
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,479
that plant phytochrome. Phytochrome is a

390
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
uh is an enzyme or a protein. Somebody

391
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,399
correct me there. Um I told you I didn't

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
write any notes. Uh so phytochrome is

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,159
triggered in this plant. Phytochrome

394
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,200
tells the plant it is sleepy time.

395
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,199
Phytochrome is basically um giving this

396
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,519
plant a little bit of ambient and a nice

397
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,120
shot of Nyquil and maybe even uh giving

398
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,000
it a little tug before it goes to bed if

399
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,240
you want so it sleeps real nice. So as

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,078
the sun sets it creates that far red

401
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
spectrum. That far red triggers the

402
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,359
phytochrome in the plants. The plants

403
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,959
go, "Hey, it's time for me to [ __ ]

404
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
sleep." They put their little sleep mask

405
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,319
on. They rub one out. They take some

406
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,399
ambient. take a shot of Nyquil and they

407
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
lay down and they're tucked the [ __ ] in.

408
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,039
So that moon is natural. That moon is

409
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,198
there. That amount of light coming from

410
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,360
the moon is reflection from the sun

411
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,439
technically. And it is not enough light

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
compared to the sun. It is not enough

413
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,079
light to even bother those plants. First

414
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
of all, because uh the intensity of the

415
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,278
sun is so much more intense than that

416
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,120
reflection coming from the moon that

417
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,039
it's not going to bother them. And

418
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,198
that's what those plants are programmed

419
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,480
to do. That's naturally what happens.

420
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,319
whatever you believe in. I'm going to

421
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
say jaw because I'm a Rasta man. But the

422
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,959
creator, the most high, mother nature

423
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,399
would not have put a a living thing out

424
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,919
there that would struggle because of the

425
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,759
moon and the sun. Those are natural

426
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,120
things that nature, jaw, the most high,

427
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,799
whatever you believe in, it knows that

428
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,078
[ __ ] is there and it knows that these

429
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,159
plants are going to be out there in that

430
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,838
environment. So, nature wouldn't make it

431
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,360
to where the moon [ __ ] up that plant.

432
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,880
Nature just wouldn't do that. Whatever

433
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
you believe in or don't believe in. Even

434
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,480
if you're an atheist, you could believe

435
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
you can say nature or science would not

436
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,360
have done that to us or the plant simply

437
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,839
wouldn't survive. So that sunlight is a

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
very minimal reflection of a big ass

439
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
[ __ ] light. So you're getting I don't

440
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
know the mathematical percent. But if

441
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,278
the light is a thou the sun is a

442
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,879
thousand, the moon is a two. So it's

443
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,000
it's like it's not even there. It's it's

444
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,039
like that little nightlight in the

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,320
corner when you're at home trying to

446
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,919
sleep, you don't even notice that that

447
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
shit's there. The plants don't notice

448
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,360
that because the percentage of light

449
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
that it was getting all day compared to

450
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,680
the moon reflection and the combination

451
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,278
of the far red lighting triggering the

452
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,838
phytochrome response to tuck the plants

453
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,759
into sleep. Now, the same thing comes

454
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,760
into play when we talk about like your

455
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,838
porch light or a street light. This

456
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,000
depends on a couple of things. How close

457
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
to your plants are those lights? How

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
intense are those lights? How frequent

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,919
are those lights? What kind of schedule

460
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,040
are those lights on? Then it also

461
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,639
depends on the sensitivity of that plant

462
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,679
that is being affected. There's

463
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,959
something in a plant, I'm thinking of

464
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,719
the word, I'm scrolling. It's called the

465
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,958
critical period. The critical period is

466
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,120
how much darkness that plant needs to

467
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,278
initiate its flowering cycle. Based on

468
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
its location uh on the earth where that

469
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,360
plant came from or its parents came

470
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,000
from, it may need less or more darkness

471
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,839
to go into flower. Also, that same thing

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,759
goes into effect on how much light is

473
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,320
going to piss that plant off when it is

474
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,240
in its dark cycle and flowering. So, a

475
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
lot of plants, most plants, uh, a lot of

476
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
the plants we're growing now will work

477
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,839
well outdoor and not be bothered too

478
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,360
much by a little bit of light. If you

479
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,120
got a porch light right above your

480
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
plants, that might [ __ ] them up. If you

481
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
got a street light right above your

482
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
plants, that might [ __ ] them up. But, if

483
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
you if they're a little bit away and

484
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,799
it's not super intense and you've got

485
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
plants that have been adjusted to an

486
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,159
outdoor environment, it should not have

487
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
too much effect. This is going to be

488
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,399
plant specific like I'm talking about.

489
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,039
Um, as I reached up to describe the

490
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,720
street light, um, I've heard people say

491
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,399
just shoot that street light out. Just

492
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,320
disconnect that street light, ruin that

493
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,078
street light in some way. Don't do that

494
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,078
because when you do destroy that street

495
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,678
light or that lamp, that outdoor light,

496
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,798
the city is going to come replace that

497
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,759
bulb. And when they do, they're going to

498
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,038
look down and they're going to go, "Oh,

499
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,000
this [ __ ] shot it out cuz he's

500
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,599
growing weed down there." And they're

501
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,959
going to be mad at you. They don't care

502
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,958
you're growing weed. They don't give a

503
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
[ __ ] until you shot out their light. And

504
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,279
now they're pissed. Now, they're going

505
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
to call the cops on you and charge you

506
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,160
for the light and charge you for the

507
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
[ __ ] weed you're growing. So, don't

508
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,558
destroy that light. That is just a small

509
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,879
random piece of advice. So, the question

510
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
is, uh it was oddly worded, but I got it

511
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,799
figured out. We're growing in a tent and

512
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,960
light leaks matter. Why doesn't the moon

513
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,720
[ __ ] with our plants? Uh first of all,

514
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
because John knew better. The Most High

515
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
knew. It was like, I'm gonna give you

516
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,038
sun. I'm gonna give you moon. They have

517
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,000
to work together. I can't [ __ ] that up.

518
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,160
So, John knew that one. But then also uh

519
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,079
far red lighting, phytochrome response,

520
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,160
the plants are tucked in. That is

521
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,000
magically what's doing it. I am

522
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
affiliated with a grow light company,

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,038
but there are grow lights out there that

524
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,879
do have far red lighting attached to

525
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,558
them. Give them a try if you want to. I

526
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
have not tried it. Uh I'm not sponsored

527
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,879
by that company, but I heard they do

528
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,720
great [ __ ] All right. Uh my friend

529
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
Tina, thank you for the great question.

530
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,558
Um, I am going to send you a coupon code

531
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,960

you check your inbox. All right, Ganja

533
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,160

534
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,759
here in front of me. Uh, before we jump

535
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000

544
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,960

547
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,319
appreciate it. Now, let's stay on track

548
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,919
and jump into this next question. This

549
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,079
one came from my friend who wants to be

550
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
called Patient Kuckian. Big shout out to

551
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,918
my buddy Patient Kuckian. There is a

552
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,678
long intro at the start of this one. It

553
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,440
says, "We met at the DGC cup. Yo, it was

554
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
great meeting you. Uh, there's a little

555
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,038
more going on. Uh, you've been listening

556
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
for a while and thank you. I appreciate

557
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,319
that. I do want to get right to the

558
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,720
question." It says, "On one of your

559
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,279
shows, you said something about a strain

560
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
that does not have a male chromosome or

561
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,119
something like that. You went on to say

562
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,038
that the strain would never have a male

563
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,959
plant. Uh, can you go into deeper

564
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,400
details about how this happens and why

565
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
you cannot have a male from that

566
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
strain?" I do know what you're talking

567
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,640
about and we're going to touch on this.

568
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,239
Uh, there's one small detail you might

569
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
have overlooked. It said, "Can this

570
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,400
cultivar ever have a male plant

571
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,319
created?" Possibly yes. Uh, then it

572
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
said, "I'm a Desert Storm veteran. Thank

573
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,879
you for your support, my dude. you are a

574
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,279
Desert Storm veteran. Thank you for your

575
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,280
service. Uh I definitely uh do respect

576
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,960
and appreciate the veterans. Said

577
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,480
perhaps I will have more questions when

578
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
my favorite plant becomes legal. All

579
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,679
right, there's a lot of stuff going on

580
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,919
on this question, but I want to focus on

581
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,080
this one part here about I said in a

582
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
previous episode that there is a plant

583
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,159
that does not have male chromosomes or

584
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
something like that. I want to touch on

585
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
this and just clear this up because I

586
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,279
don't know if other people caught this.

587
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,360
I don't know if I said something wonky

588
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,519
or misled you. Um, so a female plant, a

589
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,519
pure female plant does not have male

590
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,759
chromosomes. So what I'm talking about

591
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,839
in to recap on your question, what I'm

592
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,079
talking about in that episode, I have a

593
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,480
golden goat female plant, which is a

594
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,319
pure female. So that is two X

595
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,319
chromosomes. That's two girl female

596
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,558
chromosomes. If there was a Y in there,

597
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,240
that would be a male. So that's mainly

598
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,918
what I'm talking about when I say that

599
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
um, it doesn't have a male chromosome.

600
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
It's a female plant. Um, I've [ __ ]

601
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
with this plant. I've manipulated this

602
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,158
plant. It doesn't out. It doesn't give

603
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,440
me stress issues. So, that's what I'm

604
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
talking about. When there's no male

605
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
chromosome in that plant, it is just a

606
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,079
pure female. Now, here's where the magic

607
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,519
with that lack of male chromosomes

608
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,519
happens. This is where people may have

609
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,759
gotten confused where the uh the things

610
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,519
start to change. We've got a female, no

611
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,038
male chromosomes. That's a normal thing.

612
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,279
That just happens. That's how females

613
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,679
work. There's no Y's, it's all X's,

614
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,440
genetics, genes. What I'm going to do

615
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,519
now is I'm going to treat my double XX

616
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,640
plant with a solution and it is going to

617
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,038
create pollen, which is all X's and no

618
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,880
Y's. So now I'm creating all female

619
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,640
pollen. I'm then going to take that

620
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,679
female pollen and put it on other solid

621
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,840
female plants, XX plants, no Y's

622
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,919
anywhere in this mix. So now that I've

623
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,000
taken a female plant, I've treated it

624
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,559
with a solution. And now that female

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,319
plant is creating anthers with all

626
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,200
female pollen. And I'm going to put that

627
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,279
female pollen on female plants. There

628
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
will be no Y chromosome in my

629
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,558
mathematical equation here. So there's

630
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,719
no male involved. There will be all

631
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,759
female plants making all female seeds

632
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,120
here. Um that's that's why I said no

633
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,879
male chromosome. So I hope I cleared

634
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,119
that up. Not sure what I said to make

635
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,320
that confusing, but just in case anybody

636
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,599
out there misheard, misunderstood uh the

637
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,038
uh something about a strain that doesn't

638
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,959
have a male chromosome or something like

639
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,879
that. Yeah. Uh it just doesn't. It's a

640
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
female plant. There were other plants in

641
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
the batch that came from that batch of

642
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,880
seeds that were never released. Those

643
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,519
could have had a male in there, but the

644
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
plant that I have is pure female. The

645
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,519
seed that I grew, the seed, the clone

646
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,759
that I acquired is all female. It's a

647
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,440
clone plant that I got. It's all female.

648
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,519
There's no male chromosomes in there.

649
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
So, um I'm just going to repeat myself

650
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,038
by taking that female and reversing it

651
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,839
and putting it on another female. I

652
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,359
never said male in there. And people are

653
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,798
going to say the word hermaphrodite when

654
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,399
I talk about reversals. That's not

655
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,599
accurate. That's not true. That's not

656
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,200
real. Ah, that's a a weird random fake

657
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,279
argument. So, that doesn't count. That's

658
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
not even There's no hermaphroditism in

659
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,119
my breeding project in any reversal if

660
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,280
done correctly. If there's a

661
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,719
hermaphrodite, an interex plant, it's

662
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,158
been [ __ ] chopped the [ __ ] up and put

663
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,839
it in the compost bin. So, um, there is

664
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,799
no male chromosome simply because I'm

665
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,279
using all female plants. Um, could you

666
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,960
make a male strain? Let's see. And why

667
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,720
you cannot have a male? Can this

668
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,840
cultivvar ever have a male created? You

669
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,038
could treat it with epifon and it will

670
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,720
masculineize that plant. Yes, that's a

671
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,480
whole another process. Whole another

672
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,279
whole another [ __ ] podcast to talk

673
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
about, but you could. Yes. Um, my dude,

674
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,678
uh, I think I've answered your question.

675
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
I hope so. Um, the females don't have

676
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
male chromosomes because they simply

677
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,679
don't. And it's not an interex plant, so

678
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,279
there's no hidden, uh, agenda in there.

679
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,120
And when I reverse it, it only makes

680
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,639
female pollen. I'm going to put it on

681
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,239
other female plants that have been

682
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
tested. So, in that situation, no male

683
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,200
chromosomes, only females. All right, I

684
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,439
think I answered this one, my dude. Once

685
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,720
again, thank you for your service. Uh,

686
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
