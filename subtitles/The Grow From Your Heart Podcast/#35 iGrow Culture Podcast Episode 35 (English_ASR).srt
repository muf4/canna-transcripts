143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,199
episode 30 I said that I would uh start

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,399
paying a dollar every time I say the f-

145
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,639
word because I'm trying to not say the

146
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,159
f- word on the

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,639
podcast I need somebody to go back and

148
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,639
listen from episode 30 to 34 and let me

149
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,280
know how many dollars I owe there's a

150
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,000
sick child in need and I had a

151
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,519
conversation with one of his parents I

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,079
think it was his uncle and I said that I

153
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,439
would help them out when the time came

154
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,359
up and so this is my uh my obligation to

155
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,038
them I know it's only a dollar but what

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to do now starting on episode

157
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:26,199
35 every time I say the f word it costs

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,879
me $5 I will donate $5 to this sick kid

159
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,199

160

episode the people have been asking for

214

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,680
today awesome Jesse actually said that

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,120
he could use a little uh what is it a

218
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,439
primer lesson is that what it's called

219
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,720
on how to how to cure some herbs I've

220
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,560
never uh never been real happy with any

221
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,479
of my cure jobs so I mean I've been told

222
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,199
they're great but

223
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,478
um um you know this I always I feel that

224
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,360
I have a lot of room for improvement

225
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,878
there so your standards on your own

226
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,840
product are always higher than everybody

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,960
else's your own expectations you know

228
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,560
what I mean I'm never satisfied with my

229
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,680
my herb or anything and everyone's like

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,199
that was amazing yeah especially when I

231
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,720
play music I'm like that could have been

232
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,840
better and they're like no dude you

233
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,639
nailed it like no that was sloppy I can

234
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,598
feel the same thing snowboarding as well

235
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,079
yeah U me on a snowboard it's like

236
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,680
trying to put a telephone pole on a

237
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,719
snowboard and it's just a lot of me

238
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,038
rolling down a hill on my face oh man I

239
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,120
thought you snowboarded actually I I do

240
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,680
but I spend more time on the lift and on

241
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,038
my ass than I do on the actual board I

242
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,158
can't do it anymore the left knee

243
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,759
disagrees with the snowboard now oh that

244
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,478
sus it feels like uh feels like my left

245
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
knee wants to fly out of the socket the

246
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,680
entire time I'm strapped in that I can't

247
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,120
ski for a similar reason

248
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,599
they told me to move to skis they said

249
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,360
it wouldn't hurt as bad if I skied

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,158
possibly maybe I'll try that this winter

251
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
case to case my snowboard friends have

252
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,879

254
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,519
curing herb not talking about curing

255
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,719
ourselves actually I guess curing herb

256

261
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,639
the regular rig uh the enail couldn't

262
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,160
keep up with the puddles we were putting

263
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,078

00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,000
you doing good bro by the way I just

273
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,399
kind of skipped right over introducing

274
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,120
you you having a good day you look like

275
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,919
you're working hard kind of busy very

276
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,278
very hard well take some dabs take a

277
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,639
break we'll record it'll be awesome y so

278
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,120
if you're going to cure some

279
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,879
weed um you're going to need a few

280
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,440
things you should have a dehumidify

281
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,278
maybe you should have an air conditioner

282
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,600
maybe you for sure need fans at least

283
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,439
one fan you need what I call a

284
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,639
hygrometer that's a uh it's a

285
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
thermometer with a humidity reading on

286
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,480
it also then you're going to need some

287
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,120
kind of jars I prefer glass mason jars

288
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,278
uh if you're going a little bigger

289
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,600
there's a company I think it's called

290
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:52,039
quickvac they're little suction vac lid

291
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
jars they sell them at most of the head

292
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,439
shops those are pretty chill to cure

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
your weed in a lot of people don't like

294
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,240
them because those are plastic I don't

295
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,679
think they leave any taste or smell

296
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,200
those don't if you're going bigger I

297
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,838
like to buy those rubber made uh 32 CT

298
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
containers I think that's what it is

299
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,320
it's a big container uh it's like a

300
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,839
two-handed container uh you could fit a

301
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,040
lot of Herb in one of those to cure it

302
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,839
those work perfectly so you're going to

303
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,360
need something to cure it in and a room

304
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,360
uh to get it started to cure

305
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,278
in uh Ed Rosenthal actually taught me

306
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,440
that curing begins at the start of

307
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,879
harvest um I'm not sure how much I

308
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
subscribe to Ed's teaching but in a

309
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,879
sense that is is accurate uh the minute

310
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,920
you cut down that plant you're starting

311
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,559
the curing process you need that herb to

312
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,240
dry

313
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,719
uniformly uh not too fast not too slow

314
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
and you don't want it in a hot room you

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,079
don't want it in a cool room so we're

316
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,838
going to kind of go from and one of our

317
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,599
lessons before we talked from where we

318
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,320
talked about harvest and drying uh and

319
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,000
we ended drying as when where the sticks

320
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,320
on your buds snap that's pretty much

321
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
where we decided we were entering cure

322
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,680
so if you've done everything right

323
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,879
you've got all your leaves off uh your

324
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,278
buds have dried evenly in a nice room

325
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,919
that was temperature controlled not too

326
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,320
fast not too cool and now the sticks are

327
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,559
snapping and the buds are a little bit

328
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,120
damp a little bit juicy if you squeeze

329
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,759
them uh they kind of stick to your

330
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,839
fingers but they kind of spring back to

331
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,078
life they don't you don't crush them

332
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,800
when you squeeze

333
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,399
them you want them to have a little

334
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,399
spring left into them for sure all right

335
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,958
so I guess I should read and don't be

336
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:27,559
deceived by um the crunchy layer some I

337
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,919
guess it goes strain to strain but

338
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,119
sometimes there's a lot more leaf on the

339
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,599
outside

340
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,839
oh yeah um you know

341
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,560
it's you could get tricked either way

342
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,399
you know sure by letting it over dry and

343
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,479
uh also by thinking it's dry too soon so

344
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,679
right uh the weed dries from the outside

345
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,278
or from the outside in so even though

346
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,719
the outside leaves are crispy and dry

347
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:53,958
the inside could be really juicy still

348
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,120
so you got to be careful and little buds

349
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,919
are uh going to dry quicker than the big

350
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,360
buds right I feel that's a um I like to

351
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,360
cut When I grow a big butt I actually

352
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,200
cut that all down into the little uh the

353
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,440
little golf ball size nuggets if you if

354
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,079
you're one of my patients you usually

355
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
get a bag full of golf balls is what I

356
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,319
give you I do when uh when I'm doing

357
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,600
like the final Trim um sometimes when

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,720
they're hanging you know the the bigger

359
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,440
buds are a little harder to break down

360
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
sometimes so um nothing to do with them

361
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,480
yeah you don't want to put them on a

362
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
rack you got to let them hang okay well

363
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,519
right before we're before we're going to

364
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,759
cure this is when the sticks will pop so

365
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,959
everything's all trimmed up now we don't

366
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
have any leaves left uh they look pretty

367
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,000
they're manicured the way you want uh

368
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
when you grab one of the buds you pick

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,240
it up and you bend the stick it should

370
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,559
snap you don't want it to bend like a

371
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
straw you want it to actually break pop

372
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,278
you don't want to leave it until it like

373
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,760
explodes and breaks cuz then you're a

374
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,759
little too dry um too dry or too wet of

375
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,559
cannabis will not cure properly if

376
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,439
you're too dry you've already missed

377
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,479
your point uh you're going to get stale

378
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,560
buds you're just going to put it in the

379
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,879
jar and waste time if you're too wet and

380
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,278
you try to cure it you're actually going

381
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,958
to Pro uh promote mold so you want it

382
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,480
about right where those stick snap and

383
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,000
that's when you're going to start the

384
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,440
curing process um let me read you what I

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,480
wrote of what curing actually is and

386
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,120
what the pro uh the purpose of curing is

387
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
this is what I just what I wrote down to

388
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,440
give an actual reason curing is used to

389
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,360
remove excess moisture to convert

390
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,880
complex uh to convert complex carbs back

391
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,879
into sugars while removing chlorophyll

392
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,720
chlorophyll is green pigment and

393
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,278
chlorophyll makes your buds taste harsh

394
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,278
and smell bad and it also makes your

395
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,720
buds burn portly uh if you guys ever

396
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,720
smoked herb that kind of maybe tastes

397
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
like you just stuck your tongue in a

398
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
light socket and you just want to scrape

399
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,599
your tongue off or you need a drink real

400
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,039
bad that stuff was not dried and cured

401
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,879
properly probably not flushed properly

402
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,919
either uh also as THC dries the THC

403
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,360
dries in your buds if it dries more

404
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,278
slowly uh the more slower it loses its

405
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,360
water moisture the more psychoactive it

406
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,720
will become once the water comes out of

407
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,000
that THC that's when it's ripe and nice

408
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
and Prime for you to smoke so by curing

409
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,759
it you slowly let that happen and you

410
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,799
don't destroy the THC you don't destroy

411
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,519
your

412
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,359
tpin um essentially curing allows

413
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
aerobic bacteria to consume the

414
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,879
chlorophyll in the plants chlorophyll is

415
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,278
what we want to remove um aerobic

416
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,000
bacteria sounds like a bad thing it's

417
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,240
actually a good thing in this instance

418
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,240
um aerobic bacteria is made from air

419
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,720
light and moisture being sealed inside

420
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,198
of that jar so what I do I actually take

421
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,120
my buds that snap I fill my mason jar

422
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,120
about 90% of the way full I don't want

423
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
want to squish them in there I just want

424
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,679
to lightly set them in there then I seal

425
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,799
that jar um as soon as that jar is

426
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,439
sealed the aerobic bacteria begins to

427
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,838
form and that aerobic bacteria will

428
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,720
start eating away the chlorophyll in

429
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,360
there um so when you open that jar

430
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,920
that's when the reaction will restart so

431
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,360
what you want to do what I do is I put

432
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,719
the buds in the jar I seal it up and

433
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,360
then I wait about 2 hours and then I go

434
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,519
open the jar and that first time I'll

435
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,680
pour the buds out onto my little tray

436
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,959
and I want to feel the buds and make

437
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,039
sure they're not they haven't gotten

438
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,559
really moist or they haven't if you can

439
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,240
see sweat inside the jar get them out of

440
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,000
there immediately you you [ __ ] up get

441
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,159
them out of there right away uh once so

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,839
I take them out of the jar and I start

443
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,439
squeezing them and I want to feel a

444
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,279
little bit of moisture at the edge cuz

445
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,160
it's coming out of the middle on the

446
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,320
surface but I don't want them to be damp

447
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,958
and sticky to where I'm afraid they're

448
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,199
going to get mold so I'll leave them out

449
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,278
this first time I dump them out and

450
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,559
check them all out I leave them sitting

451
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,278
out for a couple minutes if I feel like

452
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,958
they need it then I'll put them back in

453
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,559
the jar and seal that jar up if they're

454
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,479
uh properly dry like I'm hoping they are

455
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,039
at this point I'll leave it closed for 4

456
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,159
hours this time and I know this sounds

457
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,879
tedious but this is where this is what

458
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,519
separates the the pros from the regular

459
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,159
Growers this is where you get that super

460
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,519
high-grade cured cannabis uh that's

461
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,679
stuff you're getting at the dispensary

462
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,879
that tastes kind of hayik and I don't

463
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,519
mean to call out the shops but they

464
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,720
don't have time or space or Manpower or

465
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,720
the patients to cure herb uh your

466
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
caregiver or your private grower or you

467
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,639
are the only way you're going to get

468
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,360
good cured herb the dispensary is not

469
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,440
going to do it it tastes you can taste

470
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,039
the nutrients you can taste the leaves

471
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,560
you can taste whatever other planet was

472
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,799
growing next to or hanging next to in

473
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,679
the dry room you can taste that in these

474
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,198
dispensary buds in my opinion there are

475
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,838
very few shops that are actually curing

476
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,838
their Herb in my opinion I don't work

477
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,199
there so I can't tell you what they're

478
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,279
doing I thought you were going to say

479
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,359
there's very very few shops flushing

480
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,958
their stuff that too that too curing it

481
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,278
well you're going to have to let me know

482
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,559
when we that's that's where we'll we'll

483
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:35,078
go there and get some herblin day

484
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,119
so where I uh so you got to put you put

485
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,318
your buds back in the jar you seal the

486
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,720
jar you wait four hours uh that's when I

487
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,318
open it again and then I want to check

488
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
the buds and make sure that they're not

489
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,399
getting uh too much moisture is not

490
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,839
coming out of there if I feel like it's

491
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,360
really humid inside of the jar I said

492
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,759
humid if it's not too humid inside of

493
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,600
the jar uh I'll put them back in there

494
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,959
seal it up and let them sit for like 6

495
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,519
hours um I pretty much increase the time

496
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,679
just by a couple hours until I get to

497
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,798
about 12 hours uh and then once you're

498
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,879
checking them twice a day so I'll do 6

499
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,400
hours and then I'll do like 10 hours and

500
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,959
then I'll wait till about 12 hours and

501
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,519
then I'll usually open them like every

502
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,480
morning when I wake up and then right

503
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,279
before I go to bed that's about 12 hours

504
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
usually in my world so you pop open the

505
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,798
jar make sure it's not too moist let it

506
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,679
sit open for just like 10 or 15 minutes

507
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,599
you just want to exchange the air and

508
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,640
then seal it back up and let it sit

509
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,159
there uh once you've got it to a point

510
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,280
where you know it's not going to get any

511
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,400
mold in it that's when I like to just

512
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,038
seal it up and leave it I won't open it

513
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,360
anymore um go ahead it it'll it should

514
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:41,798
burn really nicely at this point correct

515
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:43,479
it should burn nice and smooth um and

516
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,359
you can tell um I don't know if you guys

517
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,360
have ever had perfectly cured herb it's

518
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,519
hard to get honestly very but it there

519
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,759
you know that herb you can smell down

520
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,679
the block you're going oh man that stuff

521
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,839
was slowly dried and cured it let all of

522
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,200
the chlorophyll sneak out and it let all

523
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,759
of the flavor that should have been

524
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,120
there uh when the chlorophyll disappears

525
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,640
that's when the other colors the Reds

526
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,279
and the purples start popping up and you

527
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,559
can start seeing those and that's what

528
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,519
gives you really pretty Buds and that's

529
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,000
when the THC is allowed to dry slowly

530
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,839
that's when it becomes more psychoactive

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,519
I'm not completely sure about the

532
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,879
terpenoids but it sounds like we need to

533
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,639
give these terpenoids a little bit of

534
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,520
time to cure in there also so they're

535
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,600
not getting destroyed or taken out along

536
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,400
with the chlorop filler with the

537
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,798
moisture if we let it go slowly I think

538
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,360
we're making it smell better because

539
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,960
we're doing something to the turps and

540
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,439
from what I know about them they seem

541
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,480
very fragile too so this is you know

542
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,759
mild or moderate temperatures and

543
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,000
darkness I think are all very key to

544
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,200
this I think I read that terpenoids uh

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,319
evaporate at approximately

546
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,159
85° um we read on another on another

547
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,759
episode about 106° was I think where we

548
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,720
said so I think it's right around 100

549
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,879
degrees and some your guys's drying and

550
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,319
curing rooms are getting that hot excuse

551
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
me I need a sip

552
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,280
nice all those dabs got me all dried out

553
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,279
and thirsty dude we took some monster

554
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,720
dabs before the show that was pretty

555
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,599
killer uh so you need to keep opening

556
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,319
those jars until you're

557
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,079
confident that it's not going to mold up

558
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,038
in there you want a little bit of

559
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,678
moisture Kyle kushman prefers a bud he

560
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,519
likes to open his jar and take out a

561
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:23,640
couple of nugs and set them on the table

562
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,000
and he would have sat here and talked

563
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,360
for 20 minutes before he would have been

564
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,319
able to roll them up he would have had

565
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,079
to give you a lecture about veganics

566
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,359
and then after that the bud would be

567
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,199
almost dry enough to roll up sorry Kyle

568
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,279
I'm just picking on you bro you're great

569
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,640
but so Kyle likes his buds a little more

570
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,678
moist our buddy Adam will take a nicely

571
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,600
dried and cured Bud that I've given him

572
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,440
and he'll set that [ __ ] out all day

573
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,558
until it's crispy dry and then he grinds

574
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,400
it up in the grinder towards dust and

575
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,200
takes heroic size bong hits out of it

576
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,280
cuz that's what he likes to

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,000
do but the what you want to do is I like

578
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,599
to get it to where it's it's not fluffy

579
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,038
but it's it's got some squishy to it so

580
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,439
if you've got a nice hard dense nug you

581
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:05,400
want to be able to give it a squeeze and

582
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,279
it just pops back up you don't want to

583
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,880
crush it and you don't want dust you

584
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,480
definitely don't I don't want that dry

585
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,360
Dusty buds no God no um how long do you

586
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,880
try to store your

587
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,359
cannabis um some of it gets stored for

588
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,840
up to 9 months I suppose but you know

589
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,399
some of the outdoor stuff um some of my

590
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,359
patients I can give them their whole

591
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,360
year Supply at once and they're fine

592
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,918
with it some of my other patients ask me

593
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,599
to hold on to it for them so um and then

594
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,240
you know some of them went indoor Bud

595
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:43,158
throughout the year so you know it's all

596
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,279
a balance but yeah okay um the last

597
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,320
couple years my stuff that's gotten 9 10

598
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:51,798
months I just I really wasn't happy with

599
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,558
it um by the time it was that age Let's

600
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,240
uh let's work on curing a little better

601
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:57,079
and I bet that those buds will store

602
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,120
longer I think I messed up in the

603
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,639
beginning um

604
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,359
I do pretty much you what you do for the

605
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,200
the 2hour pull it out of the jar then

606
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:10,479
the 4 Hour but then it normally it'll go

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,400
24 hours 18 hours before I I mess with

608
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,240
it again you got to set some alarms I've

609
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,519
got my iPhone full of alarms just

610
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,960
ridiculous beeps people think I'm doing

611
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,519
something crazy cuz every two hours I

612
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,400
got to run away I I'll be back dude and

613
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,839
got to go somewhere and go pop open a

614
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,679
bunch of jars and then go back and get

615
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,079
them for sure if you're using larger

616
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,519
batches I guess I should have covered

617
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,359
this what I like to do is get one of

618
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,079
those big uh they're like purple

619
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,319
Tupperware containers rubber made

620
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,278
containers uh fill that up with your you

621
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,359
can leave it on the sticks a little bit

622
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,558
if you have to it's easier I prefer it

623
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,719
off the stick for this curing process

624
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,480
fill those containers and then I

625
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,360
actually flip them upside down and take

626
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,159
the container off the lid instead of

627
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,839
taking the lid off the container so you

628
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,400
leave more exposed area and then just

629
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,158
pop that container back onto the lid try

630
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,798
not to squish any buds I hope that makes

631
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,039
sense you pop it open Lift the container

632
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,599
off the lid sitting there like a tray

633
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,599
full of buds for sure yeah that gets a

634
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,399
lot of air flow in there yeah I like to

635
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:08,439
use those uh actually those same ones or

636
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,120
same samier size uh but they're they're

637
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,519
like the size of a brownie pan yeah and

638
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,599
that's those work for uh short-term

639
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,359
storage pretty good okay now in the

640
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,839
beginning I talked about we should have

641
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,639
a dehumidifier an AC unit fans a

642
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,038
hygrometer uh I'm going to back up and

643
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,200
talk a little bit about how Ed Rosenthal

644
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,440
says curing starts at Harvest wait hold

645
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,080
on I got one thing uh let's do it I like

646
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,519
it how you pack your jar um ah yeah I

647
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:41,480
don't like to overpack it this something

648
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,359
I um am am learning but I think there's

649
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,480
a lot of validity to

650
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:49,719
it you uh I think when you overpack it

651
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,319
you create you know possible different

652
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,640
little microclimates in there uh you

653
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,960
almost prevent the aerobic acid from

654
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,919
being able to form in there when you

655
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,519
don't have enough oxygen for sure what

656
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,799
creates IC acid I think I said before

657
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,679
was oxygen light and moisture and so we

658
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,960
need plenty of that air in there nice

659
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,200
nice don't worry about giving it light

660
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
you guys a little bit of light will

661
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,159
start it off and once you get it started

662
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,158
it's going I'm fixing the Echoes In Here

663
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
we are in a really small space that's

664
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,159
real echoe today there's a fan that

665
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,200
we're fighting with but I'm going to

666
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,240
make it happen I think I got it just

667
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,600
there sweet all right so like I said Ed

668
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,519
Rosenthal says that curing starts from

669
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,558
pretty much when you cut it down so if

670
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,639
your buds have gotten too dry they're

671
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,158
not going to cure they're going to

672
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
crumble if your buds are too moist uh

673
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,159
you still have a chance but hopefully

674
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,000
they didn't dry too quickly uh you got

675
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,480
to cut down the Plant and get all those

676
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,839
leaves off and let it dry nice and

677
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,038
slowly that's why we're talking about a

678
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,439
room with a dehumidifier with an air

679
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,278
conditioner and some fans in a

680
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,798
hygrometer you want to keep your plants

681
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,759
between 60 and

682
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,599
75° at about 50% humidity until you put

683
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,879
them in this jar until they reach that

684
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,000
stick snap in Period uh yeah that's how

685
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
you keep them from not drying too fast I

686
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,720
had a guy that uh a long time ago I used

687
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,200
to have to buy some herb and this guy

688
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,120
usually had the greatest Bud a long time

689
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,278
ago and I was bugging him I was like

690
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,439
dude you got any more of that LA

691
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,319
Confidential do you have any more of

692
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
that LA Confidential and he didn't and

693
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,558
he kept telling me I harvested it it's

694
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,039
almost ready I harvested it's almost

695
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,200
ready and I was getting eager and so uh

696
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,599
I asked him and he's like sure man I'll

697
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,440
bring it to you tonight and he brought

698
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,439
it to me and it was it was a really

699
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,480
weird texture it felt like a pine cone

700
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,360
uh it was hard but it was also squeezy

701
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,759
but the outside was really hard and then

702
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,278
you broke it open and the middle was

703
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,480
soft and it was kind of fluffy on the

704
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,398
inside so I immediately called him I was

705
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,440
like what the hell happened bro and he

706
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:44,759
said that he dried it by opening the

707
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,880
oven and setting it next to the oven so

708
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,480
that it would dry it out all night oh

709
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,760
[ __ ] yeah so that is a prime example of

710
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,200
what not to do to dry your herb I could

711
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,200
taste it smell it uh it made the weed

712
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,480
smell like spaghetti sauce like it

713
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,798
smelled like marinara for some reason

714
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,558
was the first thing that came to mind

715
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:04,079
yeah it's going to kill all the turbs

716
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,240
yeah yeah you know some sort of tomatoey

717
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,000
paste or something it was terrible that

718
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
sucks so you got to get that herb dried

719
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
properly and slowly you don't want to

720
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,000
dry it up too fast you got anything to

721
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,759
add to curing bro I feel like we went

722
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
over that really super quickly yeah um

723
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,558
I'm just really stoned it's uh me too me

724
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,319
too it's hard to project a lot of my

725
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:27,519
thoughts do you need

726
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,879
crayons um so the dehumidifier the AC

727
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,359
unit the fan

728
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,919
and uh the hygrometer you need that

729
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,319
regardless of where you're at um yeah

730
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
you got to keep you need a proper room

731
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,319
for drying a lot of guys are just

732
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,000
throwing it in their closet or something

733
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,879
you need a good area for drying uh you

734
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,558
want to keep the air moving the reason

735
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,240
for a dehumidifier what we're trying to

736
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,599
do is we are pulling water out of these

737
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,038
plants that water ends up in the

738
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,599
atmosphere around your plants and then

739
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,640
it has nowhere to go so you got to suck

740
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,639
that water out of there the dehumidifier

741
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,640
is a perfect place for that water to go

742
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,759
and you can reuse that water to water

743
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,919
your plants later

744
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,519
oh yeah that's some good water yeah

745
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:07,600
however um I do know if you're if say

746
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,240
you're drying uh not a lot of plants in

747
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,278
a large room in the

748
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,640
southwest um you might actually want a

749
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,398
humidifier to help slow things down

750
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,720
right I I'm trying to you know kind of

751
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,158
help out people regionally yeah that's a

752
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,519
good idea we're kind of talking about

753
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,039
Colorado but yeah yeah as long as you

754
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,918
you need to keep it uh about 60 to 75

755
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,599
degrees that cool actually I think will

756
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,200
make your buds dry a little more dense I

757
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,959
think it hardens them up a little bit

758
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,840
also I got to mention dark uh you want

759
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,519
that dry room dark yeah uh drying and

760
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,918
curing should happen in mostly a dark

761
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:44,359
area I feel like literally a room exact

762
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,520
two same climates one that's dark and

763
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,000
one that's light uh the room with

764
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,839
light's going to the plants are going to

765
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,440
dry

766
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,678
faster it's yeah just kind of experience

767
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,038
I have with my dry room and keeping a

768
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:01,120
window open sometimes and

769
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,480
not and I know nothing else changed so

770
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,759
so guys it is going to take a little bit

771
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,880
of practice to get your drying and

772
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,679
curing method down right uh you may have

773
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,720
to ruin a jar or two um seal that jar up

774
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,640
go to sleep open it the next day and you

775
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,200
open it and it smells like ammonia you

776
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,600
might have just kind of killed that crop

777
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,640
if it's not moldy if you don't see any

778
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,199
mold break it open as small as you can

779
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,080
get those buds pour it out on a tray let

780
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
it dry uh taste it give it a smoke see

781
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,960
if it tastes all right it might be all

782
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,558
right it might be smokable if you left

783
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,880
it in there too long and it molded up

784
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,918
throw it away

785
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,278
remember what you did fix it next time

786
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,799
don't do that same [ __ ] again yeah uh

787
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,759
always start with clean jars clean jars

788
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:40,759
yeah uh I spent a lot of time today uh

789
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,798
cleaning jars and thinking man this

790
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,960
really sucks this isn't you know but

791
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,480
it's you know every little thing counts

792
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,399
has anybody tried to cut off their feet

793
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,200
and stick cloning gel on their ankle so

794
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,479
that we can clone ourselves cuz we need

795
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,759
to make more more Growers it's hard to

796
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,759
be a a good grower sometimes there is so

797
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,158
like you got to do the growing work

798
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,038
you got to do life and then you got to

799
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,200
clean up after yourself and that's

800
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,519
always the part that gets skipped and

801
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,600
then you got to go start by cleaning

802
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,440
tomorrow guys keep your Grow rooms clean

803
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,158
cuz it builds up quickly and then you

804
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
got to clone yourself cuz you just can't

805
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,880

yeah I can't remember off the top of my

833
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,240
head you can't remember most things off

834
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,119
the top of your head anymore well yeah

835
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,120
but I'm the second biggest Sublime fan

838
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,038
never do all right guys I feel like

839
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
we've covered curing I don't know what

840
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,798
else to add to this

841
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,799
uh you're going to mess up some stuff

842
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:32,960
that's where I was it takes practice and

843
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,240
patience you're not going to get it

844
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,038
right the first time yeah what you can

845
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:43,159
do is uh go you can open it too often uh

846
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,759
that's a good thing leaving it closed

847
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,480
too long will screw you up so go in

848
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,759
there and open it if you think maybe I

849
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,159
need to open it do uh and then if you

850
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:51,480
have another jar next to it don't open

851
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,480
that one and just kind of compare take

852
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,720
notes that's the best way to become a

853
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,120
good grower and a good curer and dryer

854
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,919
is to buy practice it and take notes

855
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:04,918
what's your thoughts on rehydrating dry

856
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:06,600
weed um you know I'm not a uh I'm not

857
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,080
sponsored by this company but the humid

858
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,918
packs the humid Packs work great for

859
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,199
rehydrating your buds I've been

860
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,120
wondering what they'd be like for

861
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,558
longterm long-term storage as well um

862
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,558
I've seen a lot of people throw their

863
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,918
Herb in a sea vault which doesn't

864
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,558
sponsor me either with a couple of

865
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,480
humida packs and leave it for a really

866
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:29,038
long time um but back to the dried out

867
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,558
herb don't put lettuce or orange

868
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,519
bags please that's kind of what I was

869
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,200
getting at yeah yeah that'll make mold

870
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,240
yeah that'll make your stuff not taste

871
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,600
right it doesn't add flavor it it will

872
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,519
but not the flavor you want added yeah

873
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,240
yeah it'll be funky flavor unfortunately

874
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:49,720
it doesn't work that

875
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:52,359
way um what else was I uh a curing uh

876
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,120
herb that you've possibly purchased from

877
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:57,599
someone you know just trying to help out

878
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,199
uh listeners here TR to ask them so if

879
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,278
you've got an herb that you don't feel

880
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,000
is dry enough um if you've got some

881
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,119
patience you can cure it if it's sticky

882
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,638
you can leave it in the jar and let it

883
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,638
let it kind of dry real slowly in the

884
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,879
jar leave it in there overnight open it

885
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:13,959
up check on it in the morning and leave

886
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,960
it open for like 15 minutes and just

887
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,759
repeat that every day until it's good or

888
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,880
open it every 6 hours and check on it if

889
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,079
you're impatient yeah yeah brown paper

890
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,240
sack possibly brown paper sacks are

891
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,278
great because they kind of I did this

892
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,599
when I was just starting I kind of think

893
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,079
that they kind of make a little bit of a

894
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,719
flavor in my buds now I do too and I've

895
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:36,278
also lost a nice amount of weed a whole

896
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,519
brown paper sandwich bag to mold I Feel

897
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,200
Like It sped up the mold process I kind

898
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,278
of feel like they may absorb oils Asos

899
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,840
to very true but it if you can time it

900
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,558
right it's a great step between the

901
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,359
hanging process and the jar yeah it's

902
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:52,678
that one if you have to leave it out for

903
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,519
if you've got to be a away at work all

904
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,278
day but you know it should be in the jar

905
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,440
but it's not dry enough for the jar that

906
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,359
bag is probably going to work for you

907
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,840
there's a uh a company ideal for

908
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,398
someone come up with a brown paper sack

909
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,519
that doesn't have all those issues we

910
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,959
just mentioned it's a canvas bag yeah

911
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,200
those uh Vitamin Cottage the old Vitamin

912
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,720
Cottage shopping bags I've cured Urban

913
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,278

914
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,120
seen it done in a 5 gallon bucket as

915
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,880
well oh oh yeah yeah I've done and seen

916
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,879
that too I just prefer I prefer the

917
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,120
glass I feel like it doesn't give me any

918
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,519
flavor for sure uh if you're doing five

919
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,239

what they're talking about hasn't been

1001
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,279
shown to them yet we're going to preempt

1002
