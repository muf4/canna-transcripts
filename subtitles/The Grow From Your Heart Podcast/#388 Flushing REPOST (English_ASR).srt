00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,079
show off by letting you know what I'm

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:27,868
smoking today I'm taking dabs a fatso OG

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,729
from Green Dot labs this is the fatso og

12
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,589
full spectrum extract it's nice and

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,149
chunky it's got just the right amount of

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,738
chunky crystals and just the right

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,289
amount of Terp sauce in there I really

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,599
do approve of that ratio the cross on

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,089
this or the blend actually is GMO and

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,179
legend OG the flavor is described as

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,129
dark roast coffee garlic and fuel and I

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,109
feel like that is absolutely accurate it

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,579
has given me some ridiculous cottonmouth

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,679
I feel like you can almost hear it on

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,329
the microphone ladies and gentlemen I've

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,920
been having a really busy couple of

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,378
weeks I've been out of town twice I'm

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,059
going back out of town Thursday I have a

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,210
comedy show in Denver then I will be

28
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,429
attending the endo Expo in Denver on

29
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,280
Saturday and Sunday so I am doing

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,470
another repost for this episode the last

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,090
episode was determining ripeness now

32
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,548
that we know when the plants are ripe it

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,799
is time to begin flushing our plants I

34
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,630
feel that many new growers and many

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
experienced growers overlook the

36
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,069
importance of flushing our plants and it

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,570
is not happening properly I'm gonna say

38
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,758
this in the episode over and over again

39
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,618
but flushing is free and it can improve

40
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,719
the overall quality of your finished

41
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,640
product so why wouldn't we focus heavily

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,099
on flushing at the end of the growth

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,140
cycle I'm sure I'm gonna say that plenty

44
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,699
of times through this episode so with no

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
further ado let's jump right into an

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,259

away party and I smoked way too much

64

flour and way too much concentrate and

65
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,780

66
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,369
bit of a chest cold

67
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,930

70
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,680
want to thank you for listening to this

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,848
episode while I sound like poop all

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,530
right I'd like to start the episode off

73
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,018
by letting you know what I'm smoking on

74
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,479
today I'm taking little baby dabs of a

75
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,250
gorilla glue for ambrosia and also I've

76
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,798
got some of the New York City bezel

77
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,348
ambrosia batter both from apothecary

78
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,790
it's been a nice mix fiscal and light

79
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:49,500
today just trying to stay lightly

80
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,358
medicated and not mess up my lungs and

81
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,509
throat again I'm on the path to recovery

82
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,579
and I want to keep moving forward so a

83
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,168
minute ago I mentioned that I went to my

84
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,030
friend Brett also known as Mary's

85
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,209
motivation I went to Brett's going-away

86
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,109
party Brett is leaving the country

87
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,639
Brett's a little scared and nervous

88
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:08,340
about his trip but honestly I don't

89
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,169
think anybody deserves this more Brett

90
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,579
needs to make this adventure happen I

91
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,379
think it's going to be a great

92
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,560
experience for him so I'm super proud

93
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:19,168
and super excited for him his party was

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,479

95

101
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,579
I got to have a conversation a long

102
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,419
conversation with Chandler dabbing that

103
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,819

104
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,109

which are basically blunts rolled with

111
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,650
cannabis leaves as the wrapper that

112
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,199
really [ __ ] up my lungs you guys my

113
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,329
lungs did not like that at all they were

114
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,669
delicious to smoke and we got really lit

115
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:05,069
but that is why I think I sound like

116

132
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,718
smoked that place out for how few people

133
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:40,339
there were in there there's a pretty big

134
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:42,228
building and we smoked that [ __ ] out

135
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:44,388
pretty good you can hear to my voice

136
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,848
still alright while I've still got some

137
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,829
good voice left let's do a quick podcast

138
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:51,889
about flushing your plants before

139
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:54,348
harvest before we talk about flushing I

140
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,999
should do a quick recap in the last

141
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:59,028
episode I talked about determining

142
00:04:55,999 --> 00:05:00,949
ripeness Mike and I went fairly fast

143
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:02,718
when we got kinda rambly so I hope I

144
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,270
made it clear the determining ripeness

145
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:07,699
is usually done by using some sort of a

146
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:11,810
loop so that you can see the trichomes I

147
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,400
mentioned using a 60 or 100x loop one of

148
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,038
our friends from Instagram what's up

149
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,758
dank Sinatra our friend Dane Sinatra I

150
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,740
shear photo and seeds sent me a message

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,419
and he says now I can't see try comes

152
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,088
with my naked eye but I can tell

153
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,430
ripeness of a try comb with a 16x

154
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:31,519
jeweler's loupe they said of course in

155
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,098
my mind I'm in my mid 20s so my eyes may

156
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,448
work a little better yes dude you are a

157
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:39,348
little bit younger than me you got those

158
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,240
fresh new eyes but he corrected me he

159
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:43,338
says he can see the trichomes with the

160
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,250
16x jeweler's loupe so you may not need

161
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:48,740
that bigger loop that 60 that 100 he

162
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,560
says the 60 is working or the 16 is

163
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,468
working for him so I stand corrected you

164
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,750
may not need that big loop 16 may get

165
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:58,459
you through all so let's recap a little

166
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,800
bit about what I said about harvest

167
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:03,049
times I said that if you have a plant

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
that is said to go 60 days let it go the

169
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,218
full 60 days and start flushing at day

170
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,129
50 if you've got a plant that's supposed

171
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:14,180
to go 70 days let it go the full 70 days

172
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:16,009
and start flushing around day 60 now you

173
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,778
may say Rasta Jeff I want to dial it in

174
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,908
and cut these plants down at the perfect

175
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,408
ripeness yes you're going to have to

176
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:23,538
dial that in something I wanted to

177
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:25,639
stress is this is not your last grow

178
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:27,829
with this strain hopefully this is your

179
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,110
first run with this cultivar with this

180
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,609
cut so now you've got a new girlfriend

181
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,319
that you've got to learn a little bit

182
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,000
you've got to take her out a couple of

183
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,650
times you got to see if she wants to

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,110
come down at day 60 day 63 maybe day 67

185
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,120
maybe day 72 you've got to dial it in

186
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,740
exactly to the right day now you're

187
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,389
gonna see differences if you use

188
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,250
different nutrients you may get

189
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,870
different ripening dates if you have a

190
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,788
little bit of temperature difference you

191
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,680
may get a different ripening day so

192
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,959
you're gonna have to find the window and

193
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,728
dial that in hopefully this is not your

194
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,978
last girl with this cut hopefully this

195
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:03,349
is the first of many grows with a good

196
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:06,110
cut so if it's your first run with the

197
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,150
60-day cut start flushing around day 50

198
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,460
if this is your first time with a cut

199
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,829
that you think may go 70 days start

200
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,810
flushing it around day 60 now when you

201
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,879
get to day 60 or day 70 on whichever

202
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,990
plant you're running you don't have to

203
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,209
cut it down just because you've been

204
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,189
flushing for 10 days start paying more

205
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:24,739
attention to the trichomes if they are

206
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:26,329
not amber don't cut it down keep

207
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,879
flushing for a few more days it's better

208
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,139
to over flush then under flush the only

209
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,159
thing you're doing is not giving it

210
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,720
nutrients it may have gotten a little

211
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,120
bigger it may have gotten a little

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,000
beefier but we're just trying to figure

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,538
out the plant for the first time so that

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,550
is how to determine when to begin flush

215
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:45,168
if you don't know the cultivar that

216
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,240
you're using maybe it's a brand new seed

217
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:48,500
maybe it's a new clone maybe you're just

218
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,050
new at growing and you don't know when

219
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,579
to cut it allowing the plant 60 to 70

220
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,680
days to grow and then giving yourself

221
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,109
extra time at the end is always your

222
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,750
best bet with a new cut alright so I

223
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,400
feel like I have established how to tell

224
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,560
if the plant is ripe and ready to cut

225
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,899
down and I feel like we have a good idea

226
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,329
of when to start flushing let's actually

227
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:11,149
talk about flushing our cannabis plants

228
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,408
I think flushing is super simple and

229
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,989
it's something people could easily

230
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,610
improve and they are really skipping

231
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,310
that step and I'm not sure why because

232
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,740
it's free it's a really easy step to

233
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,709
improve your cannabis and it is free

234
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,900
maybe people simply don't understand the

235
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,879
importance of flushing and why it's

236
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,519
important so let me tell you quickly why

237
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,668
flushing matters just imagine you've

238
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,338
been pouring salty nutrients into this

239
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:39,439
plant for nine weeks of flower plus

240
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,700
another three or four weeks of veg

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,300
you've just been filling it up with

242
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,310
nutrients

243
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,569
you've been pouring whatever nutrient

244
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,458
Brandi are using you've been pouring

245
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,170
nitrogen you've been pouring phosphorus

246
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,969
you've been pouring potassium and you've

247
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:52,819
been pouring carbohydrates into these

248
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,480
plants for the past 12 weeks now all of

249
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,730
that stuff is

250
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,528
built up inside of that plant the plant

251
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,909
is not using all of it it's letting some

252
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:01,009
of it go it's turning some of it into a

253
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:02,750
gas and transpiring some of it out but

254
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,569
some of it is still in the plant

255
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,909
if those nutrients are left in the plant

256
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,278
when we harvest try and cure that plant

257
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,610
we're going to taste it the plants are

258
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,620
going to taste like crap if you feed too

259
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,539
much cal-mag too late and flower you're

260
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,429
going to taste it if you feed your

261
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,289
plants too much potassium silicon light

262
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:23,000
and flower you're going to taste it also

263
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:24,769
the plants are not going to burn

264
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,629
properly when you dry and cure these

265
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,100
buds they're not gonna smoke you're

266
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,689
gonna grind it up in a grinder you're

267
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,430
gonna roll a joint and it's just gonna

268
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,620
burn black and make a funky weird

269
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,138
charcoal that's because they're leftover

270
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,000
nutrients that you did not flush out we

271
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,370
can get that stuff out of there by

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,129
properly flushing the plants you were

273
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,929
mostly flushing the soil you want to

274
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:47,120
clean out the soil so there's nothing

275
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:49,909
left in your media but whether it's soil

276
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,159
soilless mix if you got peat whatever

277
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:54,110
you're working in you're gonna want to

278
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,629
flush that if it's rock wool if it's

279
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,889
cocoa you need to clean it out each

280
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,078
thing is going to take a different

281
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,639
amount of time to clean out but you want

282
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:03,979
to clean that out so the roots don't

283
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,810
have anything to eat then the plant will

284
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,089
start starving itself and it will start

285
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,818
showing as harvest fall colors and it

286
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,220
will taste proper when you dry it cure

287
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,389
it and smoke it so that's why flushing

288
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,160
is important you want to get all those

289
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,649
excess nutrients out of there all those

290
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,778
excess salts when you roll a joint and

291
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,669
smoke it you don't want it to turn into

292
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:25,759
a little briquette you want it to turn

293
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:28,909
into a nice white fluffy ash and just

294
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,698
flake away so that comes from a properly

295
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:33,620
flushed plant then that also comes from

296
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,809
a properly dried cured and trimmed plant

297
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,120
but that comes in the future today we're

298
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,619
focusing on flushing so that's why

299
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
flushing is important you guys you want

300
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,799
your herb to taste good you want it to

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,610
burn well and you want it to leave a

302
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,359
nice white clean soft - with no weird

303
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,919
chunk so let's actually talk about

304
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,500
flushing the plants flushing the plants

305
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,588
is really easy about 10 to 14 days

306
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,458
before you plan on harvesting the plants

307
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,380
prepare the amount of water that you

308
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,299
would normally water the garden with if

309
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,679
you've got 1,000 watt light maybe you've

310
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:05,528
got a five-gallon bucket full of water

311
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,399
right so get that amount of water ready

312
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:09,379
when you would normally put

313
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,049
nutrients into the water don't do that

314
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,090
just don't put nutrients in there maybe

315
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,949
if you're gonna add anything put some

316
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,440
enzymes in there if you're using an

317
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,330
enzyme that will help break down all the

318
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,280
the decaying roots and all the matter

319
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,990
inside of the root zone and it will

320
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,789
speed up the process of the flush it

321
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,070
will help speed everything up but

322
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:30,049
enzymes are pretty much the only thing I

323
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,510
would put in there other than maybe a

324
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:34,759
little bit of shine maybe one to two

325
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,809
grams of shine from veg bloom but you

326
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,250
really don't need it

327
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:39,349
mostly all you would need is some

328
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,960
enzymes for the last couple of days if

329
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,720
you're gonna flush for 14 days maybe go

330
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,940
for like 4 to 7 days add 2 grams of

331
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,500
shine and add some enzymes but then cut

332
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,510
out the shine and just keep the enzymes

333
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,340
going until the end of the process so

334
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,799
the only thing you'd put in there are

335
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,230
enzymes and possibly some shine but you

336
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,319
would be probably just fine with nothing

337
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,659
at all so clean water add the enzymes if

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,100
you're gonna do so for four to seven

339
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,490
days add the shine if you'd like to do

340
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,430
so then adjust the pH to somewhere

341
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,409
between 63 and 65 you'll be just fine 63

342
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,679
and 65 that's a good window to adjust it

343
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:17,569
to then simply water the plants with

344
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,819
that minimal solution all you've got to

345
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,200
do is pour that right into the plants

346
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,050
just like you normally do when you water

347
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,550
soak the plants and let it run through

348
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,759
now what you're doing pouring the

349
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:30,529
enzymes in there is going to help the

350
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,240
natural decaying process happen inside

351
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,980
that root zone there's dead things in

352
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,480
there the roots that are dying are dying

353
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,159
in there the enzymes are gonna eat that

354
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,649
and they're gonna speed up that process

355
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:42,259
also that shine is going to keep adding

356
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,669
density and trichomes and essential oils

357
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,620
to your plants if you choose to add the

358
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,329
shine you still need to flush for the

359
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,740
last week without the shine you guys so

360
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,330
make sure you cut that out you can leave

361
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,250
the enzymes in there if you'd like to at

362
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,970
the end but cut out that shine for the

363
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,399
last week

364
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,960
now you're probably at day 50 right if

365
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,000
we're gonna cut down at day 60 we're at

366
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,280
day 50 we just mixed up a bunch of water

367
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,309
and we just soaked that root zone so now

368
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,809
you've got a pH D water with enzymes and

369
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,139
possibly some shine running through

370
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,059
there

371
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,039
those plants are gonna start looking for

372
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,119
phosphorus and potassium it molybdenum

373
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,250
and all the other things that they want

374
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,480
there are 16 minerals that the plants

375
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,070
really want you guys start thinking

376
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,420
about that learn all 16 of them it will

377
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,100
really help you think about what you're

378
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,169
feeding your plant maybe we'll talk

379
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,639
about that in the future

380
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,229
but the plants gonna start looking for

381
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,509
that stuff and all its gonna find our

382
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,680
enzymes and shine it's gonna be like

383
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,720
well I've got essential oils

384
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,309
I'm gonna go beef up my trichomes and

385
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,170
it's got stuff to build trichomes but it

386
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,759
doesn't have the building blocks to grow

387
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,189
more plant material it doesn't have all

388
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,929
the nutrition that it needs to keep

389
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,730
building bigger buds and fatter stems

390
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,649
and going so it's gonna start showing

391
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,080
you its fall colors it's gonna start

392
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:45,610
turning into these yellow golden colors

393
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,259
you may get some reds you may get some

394
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,269
Purple's you'll get some unique oranges

395
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,860
I really like taking pictures of my

396
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,480
plants right right at the flush phase

397
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,100
because they really start showing great

398
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,470
colors the buds are nice and fat the

399
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,940
trichomes are all greasy and shiny and

400
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,399
then the leaves start getting these cool

401
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,560
golden tones to them but that's when you

402
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,720
know that the flush is working there are

403
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,399
no nutrients left in that soil for the

404
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,019
plant to eat and it is getting hungry

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,179
which is a good thing because now you

406
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,399
know that bud is gonna burn smoothly

407
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:15,339
it's not gonna have nitrogen phosphorus

408
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,319
potassium believed in them iron calcium

409
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,759
magnesium it's not gonna have all this

410
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,410
other funky [ __ ] in it that we don't

411
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,289
want to smoke it's just gonna be nice

412
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,329
and clean it'll burn nice and smoothly

413
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:26,769
and it will taste really good so you're

414
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,190
gonna start seeing these fall colors

415
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:33,909
come on that timing is going to depend

416
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,800
on your medium how much nutrients you

417
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:39,189
have been putting into the plant it's

418
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,839
gonna be very strained specific and also

419
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,490
temperatures are going to have a huge

420
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,710
effect on this if it's a little cooler

421
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,389
in the room your plants are gonna turn a

422
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,430
little more fall colors if you have a

423
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,289
lower nighttime temperature you'll see a

424
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,750
little more purple from the buds you'll

425
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:56,019
get a little more fall activity from the

426
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,549
plants like what happened in nature so

427
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,379
you're gonna mix up the solution you're

428
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,269
gonna pH it you're gonna water in the

429
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,580
plants it's gonna run out of the bottom

430
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,639
then depending on your container size

431
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,620
and the vapor pressure deficit in the

432
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,949
room you were going to have to water

433
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,750
again repeat the process you guys makes

434
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,570
up your container put the enzymes in

435
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,990
there put the shine in there pH adjust

436
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,660
it to 6.3 to 6.5 and water it right

437
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,250
through the plants repeat this process

438
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:26,409
right up to a week before harvest and

439
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,620
then do the same thing but simply take

440
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:32,589
out the shine add the enzymes adjust the

441
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,679
pH and then feed it right through the

442
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,379
plants

443
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,058
enzymes are totally not necessary the

444
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:39,980
shine is totally not necessary you can

445
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:42,019
do all of this with plain water if

446
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,240
you're adding the enzymes and shine you

447
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,789
were going to have connoisseur quality

448
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,100
cannabis that's what I would do I would

449
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:50,448
do the shine up to the last week then

450
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
after that I would just do the enzymes

451
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,659
and then I'd probably do just two or

452
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,850
three days of plain water just to give

453
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:58,009
him time to finish up there if I was

454
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,509
going at sixty days I would end up going

455
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,369
sixty three in that last three days

456
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:04,220
would just be playing water and my grow

457
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:06,079
is what would happen there so just keep

458
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,999
repeating the process you want to rinse

459
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,909
these plants out do you want to rinse

460
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:12,439
the soil out as many times as you can

461
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:14,990
between the start of flush and harvest

462
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,419
so if you can get it to dry up and re

463
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,308
water it every other day that's great if

464
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:21,498
it takes three or four days that's fine

465
00:16:19,308 --> 00:16:23,539
you're still going to get oh if you do

466
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,459
it twelve days we get three waterings in

467
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,928
there if you go every four days but if

468
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,399
you're taking that much time to water

469
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:30,409
that means you've got a large container

470
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,119
or that much time between waterings

471
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:33,469
means you've got a large container which

472
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:35,540
means you're using quite a bit of water

473
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,939
to flush that out which means you need

474
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,769
to make sure to get at least by ten to

475
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:41,659
thirty percent runoff water so if you

476
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,490
got like a ten gallon pot you're gonna

477
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:45,230
want to get at least one to two gallons

478
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,058
of runoff coming out of that that's how

479
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,709
you know you're flushing well so get

480
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:50,838
plenty of water coming out and then

481
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,188
flush the [ __ ] out of those plants I do

482
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,980
it as many times as you can but be

483
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:57,289
careful not to drown the plant don't try

484
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,789
to sneak in another flush time just to

485
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:00,860
get more water in there because that may

486
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:02,240
do more harm than good that may you may

487
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,860
kill the [ __ ] plant right there you

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,990
may just drown it you may suffocate it

489
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,149
that may be Bab maybe cutting down early

490
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,220
so don't ruin it right at the end be

491
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:11,688
careful to stay on your normal watering

492
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,850
schedule just make sure you soak the

493
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,589
[ __ ] out of it let it dry out water it

494
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,198
again do that as many times as you can

495
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:19,938
in the last ten to fourteen days and if

496
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,919
you want to add the enzymes do that if

497
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,329
you want to use shine do that those are

498
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,449
the only things I would really add at

499
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:29,178
the end so we have determined how to

500
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,250
tell if the plants are ripe we have

501
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,590
determined a good time to start flushing

502
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,179
we know what to put in the water to

503
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:38,028
flush the plants we know why we're

504
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,278
flushing we know how to flush you

505
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:42,169
basically don't mix anything up and you

506
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:44,569
run that through the plants this will

507
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,340
clean out the soil that is our main goal

508
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,450
as that's happening we're gonna see

509
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,428
colors changing we're

510
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,590
gonna see trichomes ripening we're gonna

511
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,139
see plants finishing up now you're gonna

512
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,638
get a bunch of funky you may I'm not

513
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:57,109
promising it depends on your genetics

514
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:59,869
your environment it depends on a lot of

515
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,969
things you're going to get funky yellow

516
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:05,178
leaves you're gonna get dead foliage

517
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,649
pull that stuff off there's no problem

518
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,059
with just yanking that dead stuff off

519
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:09,619
make sure you throw it away get it out

520
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:12,200
of the grow room but just pull all that

521
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:14,808
dead stuff off and throw it away now

522
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,548
about a week maybe five or three days

523
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:18,379
before you harvest go in the grow room

524
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:20,418
and to start stripping off all the big

525
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,309
leaves this is going to save you a lot

526
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,500
of time when it does come time to

527
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:25,638
harvest there won't be all these big

528
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,048
giant leaves in your way

529
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,699
just cut them off while the plant is

530
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,990
standing up while they're still stiff

531
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,730
while they're still alive you can just

532
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,960
snap them right off pop pop pop pop pop

533
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,730
you can go really fast you don't even

534
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,169
need scissors for it once you get the

535
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,548
thumb technique to just pop in a leaf

536
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,860
off you can just go in there and

537
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:42,440
defoliate a whole section really quickly

538
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,479
so a few days before harvest go in there

539
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,308
and pull off all those big leaves and

540
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,349
that will save you a big headache and a

541
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:50,210
bunch of time when it comes time to

542
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:51,859
harvest the plants you hang them upside

543
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,200
down dry and cured when it comes time to

544
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:56,509
trim half the leaves are already gone it

545
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,250
will save you a lot of [ __ ] and a

546
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,929
lot of trouble so what do you see them

547
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,898
starting to get funky take off the dead

548
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,548
ones then just a few days before harvest

549
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:06,768
probably when you cut out the shine

550
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:09,109
maybe then go in there and start pulling

551
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,669
off the leaves now another thing you

552
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,168
might want to do is you might want to

553
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,038
reduce the temperature just a few

554
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:19,639
degrees do not create a large swing and

555
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:22,190
temps between your day and night do not

556
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:24,319
go too cold at night do not try to

557
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,639
create something drastic if you can

558
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,678
bring it down two or three degrees

559
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:30,168
during the day and two or three degrees

560
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,028
during the night do that but don't go

561
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,470
crazy you guys don't shock the plants

562
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:35,599
right at the end don't give yourself

563
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,250
powdery mildew right at the end just try

564
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,689
to mimic nature and get a little bit

565
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,519
colder right at the end because what

566
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,110
happens right at the end of the season

567
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,880
it gets cold that's how things know oh

568
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:45,558
[ __ ] it's wintertime and those plants

569
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,760
will hurry up and finish so you'll see

570
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,398
more color you may get a little more

571
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,950
density and cool temps are good for

572
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:54,288
terpenes so lower the temperatures a

573
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,058
little bit right at the end now one

574
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:58,069
thing I'm sure people are going to send

575
00:19:56,058 --> 00:20:01,399
me messages about and ask is do I use

576
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:02,899
any flushing agents no I do not use

577
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,600
flushing agent I think all of the

578
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,820
flushing agents are kind of a sales

579
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,379
tactic they are not necessary and I

580
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:12,470
think they make your herb taste like

581
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,360
whatever they taste like it's the very

582
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,610
end why would I want to put in a new

583
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,919
ingredient I want to get everything out

584
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:21,019
so I do not use a flushing agent if I

585
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,660
were to use anything I would just use

586
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,220
the the solution I told you the enzymes

587
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,230
in the shine and then I would add

588
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,720
powdered coconut water would be the only

589
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,009
flushing solution that I would use and a

590
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,900
lot of people are saying what yeah

591
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:34,910
coconut water would be ideal but that

592
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,380
would get very expensive to buy it have

593
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,600
that much coconut water imagine trying

594
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,090
to get a five-gallon bucket of coconut

595
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,549
water shipped to your house every three

596
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:45,649
days for 14 days that's gonna add up

597
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,529
that's gonna get real expensive but you

598
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,210
can buy powdered coconut water it is

599
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,549
readily available from a lot of gross

600
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,140
stores bill the soil can take good care

601
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,159
of you they do not sponsor the show or

602
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,259
anything but I know that that's a

603
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,080
reliable source for powdered coconut

604
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:02,569
water also something I should mention a

605
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,509
lot of people are growing no-till a lot

606
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:09,289
of people are growing in living soil or

607
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:10,759
super soil or some sort of live soil you

608
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:13,250
guys if that is what you're working with

609
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,160
you probably do not need to flush

610
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,569
because you have created the perfect

611
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,070
environment inside your plants rise of

612
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,720
the Spirit or it's taking up what it

613
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,490
needs you're not feeding it bottled

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,539
nutrients it's not being force-fed [ __ ]

615
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,789
so it doesn't need to be flushed

616
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,319
anything our buddies sub cool when he

617
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,210
would mix up a batch of super soil and

618
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,129
put a plant in there he would just beat

619
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,990
it water for the whole flowering phase

620
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,720
and he would say I've been flushing the

621
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,940
entire time so before people started

622
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
sending me emails yes there are some

623
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,360
situations where you may not need to

624
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,490
flush if you were going no-till if

625
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,619
you're going all organic flushing is not

626
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,539
a thing now if you're running that

627
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,069
you're already up to speed and you know

628
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,170
that we don't need to teach you about

629
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:53,450
flushing you were in the advanced

630
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,680
blackbelt class already now I've got one

631
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,750
more thing I should mention before I

632
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,100
wrap up this so called quickie episode

633
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,299
that's gone on for 20 minutes you guys

634
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,990
are very welcome thank you for listening

635
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:07,490
um a good thing to do is to measure the

636
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,779
EC or the ppm of your runoff water you

637
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,059
are pouring a bunch of water into your

638
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,200
plants right collect it collect the

639
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,349
water that comes out of the bottom of

640
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,048
your plant into some sort of a vessel

641
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:19,990
your pH pen in there put your EC or ppm

642
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:22,029
pen in there and see what the EC is now

643
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,710
if you're in a soil or a soilless mix

644
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,960
you're only gonna get down so low if

645
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,269
you're in cocoa you can get those PP

646
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,308
ends down really really low see how low

647
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,429
you can get it maybe before you start

648
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:35,500
flushing that day the first day you

649
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,298
flush measure what comes out then

650
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,380
measure each time and see how low you

651
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:40,269
can get it and then just keep

652
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,460
experimenting see how low it goes every

653
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:43,779
day and see how low you can get the ppm

654
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,340
s I don't want to give any

655
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,048
recommendations on how low to try and

656
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,759
get it because it's going to vary based

657
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:50,529
on your medium and I don't want to [ __ ]

658
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,179
up your Gro you're going to have to

659
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,829
learn this based on your grow cocoa

660
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,140
you'll get it really low because cocoa

661
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:57,759
is inert cocoa is not gonna hold [ __ ]

662
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,350
same thing with rockwool you'll be able

663
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,779
to get the PPM's of your Rockwall and

664
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:04,029
your cocoa down to amazingly low levels

665
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,009
soil soilless mixes those are still

666
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,200
gonna have some high PPM's because they

667
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:10,419
are soil and soilless mixes there's just

668
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,400
a lot of [ __ ] in there but play with

669
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,960
your runoff pay attention to that see

670
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,820
how low you can get it and it'll be a

671
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,740
lot of fun it'll be a fun experiment and

672
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:19,149
then you'll actually see what's going in

673
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,529
and what's coming out of your plants

674
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,659
maybe we should just talk about

675
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,849
measuring runoff anyway in a full

676
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,710
episode we'll talk about checking the EC

677
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:28,149
or the PPM's of a solution before you

678
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,669
pour it into your plants and then we'll

679
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,009
remesh that same solution the EC or the

680
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,630
P P PMS when it comes out of the bottom

681
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,730
of your plants and we'll compare that to

682
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,440
the pH going in and the pH coming out

683
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,630
and we'll see what's happening in your

684
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,580
rhizosphere anyway that's a future

685
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,620
episode I'm just getting excited you

686
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:46,899
guys measure the electrical conductivity

687
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,459
or the particles per million of what's

688
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,500
coming out of your plant and you will

689
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,058
know if you need to flush more or not

690
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,339
and then when you cut it down write down

691
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:56,440
the PM's and then pay attention and then

692
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:57,579
if you are satisfied hit that number

693
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,470
next time and if you're not satisfied

694
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,509
maybe flush a little longer and try to

695
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,490
go lower but they'll be discouraged

696
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,079
because it's not all about the flush you

697
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,269
still have dry and cure to [ __ ] this up

698
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,980
you could ruin your whole crop after you

699
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:10,418
cut it down so ladies and gentlemen I

700
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,360
want to thank you for listening to my

701
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:15,909
flushing episode so so far we have done

702
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,889
determining ripeness determining when to

703
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:20,200
flush we've talked about flushing I

704
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,750
think the next episode in line is

705
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,850
harvesting and then after that we're

706
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,230
going to do the dry and pure episode

707
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:27,759
there will be some interruptions to that

708
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,920
schedule because I've got an episode

709
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,740
with some friends and things always pop

710
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,390
up but those are on the chart to come up

711
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,500
in order ladies and gentlemen I

712

727
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,319
for free I'm really not trying to get

728
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,700
rich off of podcasting but there are a

729
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,799
few people who said they would like to

730
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,900
contribute to the podcast I'd like to

731
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,960
make sure there is an opportunity for

732
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,310
that it is patreon.com slash grow from

733
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,230
your heart what I will do with those

734
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,869
funds is I will pay for my website you

735
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,819
guys I host this podcast on my website

736
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,509
it costs a little bit of money to do

737
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,730
that every year

738
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:27,220
also I purchased a better MacBook so

739
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,349
that I can record more efficiently my

740
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,670
old computer was not efficient as the

741
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:32,349
polite way to say it but the

742
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,880
contributions will help to go pay for

743
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,980
the MacBook that I bought and also cover

744
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,060
the cost of the website also you may

745
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,319
have heard Mike mentioned that the

746
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,809
little microphone cover needed a

747
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,970
replacement I use the funding for things

748
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,319
like that so if you'd like to contribute

749
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,240
I would appreciate it I will quit

750
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,519
begging because that got uncomfortable

751
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,750
quite quickly ladies and gentlemen I

752
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,490

762
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,730
Instagram I like to do live feeds where

763
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,649
I go on Instagram live and I hang out

764
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,509
take a couple of dads and then I take

765
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,790
questions from the Instagram live feed

766
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:20,170
and I will rant about your question and

767
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,029
teach you how to grow cannabis right

768
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,470
there on the spot I think it's fun

769
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,480
because there's no notes there's no

770
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,160
preparation today's somebody asked me a

771
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,900
fairly in-depth question and I had to

772
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,850
stare into the sky and roll my eyes for

773
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,470
about two minutes and try to bored out

774
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:34,299
the reply I was trying to give them

775
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,890
because I wasn't prepared and it's

776
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,569
really a lot of fun for me it's kind of

777
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,910
like it's like a game of stuff the

778
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:41,500
grower or stop the breeder or something

779
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,610
like that and I really find it

780
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,250
good for my brain it keeps my brain

781
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:47,019
going it keeps my growth knowledge on

782
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,279
the tip of my tongue and it keeps my

783
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,230
brain active you guys know that I had a

784
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,879
brain injury a few years ago so I like

785
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,180
to do things to keep my brain going the

786
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,950
right direction anyway I'm [ __ ]

799
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,660
people how to grow better cannabis we

800
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,880
can dispel more myths we can educate

801
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,320
more people by having another platform
