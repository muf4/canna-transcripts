the grow from your heart podcast I've

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,239
got a fun show lined up for us in this

9
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,439
episode I want to talk about starting

10
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,159
the new year strong in our grow space

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,799
before I get to that part of the show I

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,599
do want to send a big thank you to

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,640

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,520
big thank you I do appreciate all of the

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,399
support all right I feel like I covered

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,760
the cheesy part of the show now let's

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
jump into the main topic of today's

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,960
podcast this episode will come out right

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,760
at the start of the new year happy New

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,478
Year everybody I want to talk about

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,000
setting ourselves up for success in 2024

24
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,118
one of the first things I want to do to

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,959
start the new year is I'm going to clean

26
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,239
my grow space 100% I'm going to clean

27
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,478
every nook and cranny every inch of the

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,399
grow space from top to bottom then I'm

29
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,400
going to clean my nutrient storage and

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,640
mixing area then it will clean my

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,840
pesticide storage and mixing area then

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,040
it will clean all of the gear everything

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
will be shiny and brand new to start the

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,200
new year it will take me a little bit of

35
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,000
time to do this but I feel like the time

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,159
that I spend doing this will probably

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
speed me up over the next few weeks

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
because then I will know where all of my

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
gear is all the nutrients will be lined

40
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,239
up in the right spot all the mixing

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
stuff will be clean and ready to go uh

42
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,879
sometimes most of the time I do try to

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,559
put my stuff away and clean up after

44
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,039
myself and be an organized good little

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,799
grow guy but we all know that sometimes

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,399
we get in a rush uh things get

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,159
overlooked things get set in the wrong

48
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,920
place some messes get overlooked for a

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,840
little bit here at the start of the year

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,079
I'm going to clean all of that stuff up

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,478
reorganize and I do believe that it will

52
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,439
save me time just by reorganizing and

53
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,239
cleaning up my mess putting in a few

54
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,159
minutes now will save me time over the

55
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,360
next couple of weeks so the first thing

56
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm going to do is clean up my grow

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
space now the second thing I did in my

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,159
grow space I've already done this part I

59
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,159
may recommend you do it too if you are

60
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,239
using the same type of equipment it is

61
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,759
winter time here in Colorado which means

62
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,599
I am now using HPS Lighting in my grow

63
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,199
space I know those lights are old those

64
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,318
are dinosaurs but sometimes they work in

65
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,679
the right conditions I've got a basement

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,719
grow in Colorado lately it has been

67
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,840
super cold and guess what those HPS

68
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,239
lights are keeping it just right in that

69
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,000
grow space so I just recently hung two

70
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,400
HPS lights to keep it warm for the

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,479
winter conditions when I hung those HPS

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,760
lights I put two brand new bulbs in the

73
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,039
fixtures when I did that I got a piece

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,120
of duct tape and I wrote down the date

75
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,359
when I put those new bulbs in those uh

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,920
fixtures and now I know exactly when

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,519
those bulbs were placed in those

78
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,079
fixtures if you are using HPS bulbs and

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,120
you cannot remember when the last time

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
you replaced them was I strongly

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,759
recommend you do it here at the start of

82
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,079
the year and make a note of when you put

83
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,359
those bulbs in there I do try to replace

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,959
those bulbs every two maybe three crops

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,480
but it's a good idea to write down the

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,120
date when you put those bulbs in there

87
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,199
so you know exactly how long they've

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
been in there then occasionally bust out

89
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,039
your light meter I don't know if you've

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
got a real light meter I don't know if

91
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,000
you're using the photon app bust out

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
whatever you use find a distance from

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
that light that is consistent maybe go

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,438
12 18 in just do it consistently every

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,519
time and take a reading see how much

96
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,759
light that bulb is putting out if you've

97
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,000
lost more than 20 or 30% of the output

98
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,719
of that bulb it's time to swap that bulb

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,878
because you're paying for 100% of the

100
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,680
electricity if you're not getting light

101
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,438
out of that bulb it is time to switch it

102
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,319
out for efficiency so I would recommend

103
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,799
adding new bulbs and writing down the

104
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,798
date of when those bulbs were added also

105
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,719
if you're running LEDs keep in mind

106
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,239
those lights do degrade over time the

107
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,000
manufacturers don't want you to believe

108
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,878
and know that that they do degrade but

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,360
they definitely do degrade over time it

110
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,158
takes much longer than a HPS bulb but

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,079
those LEDs do lose efficiency over time

112
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,959
so maybe think about testing those as

113
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,719
well start testing those here at the

114
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,280
start of the year now I did start the

115
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,040
podcast off by saying we were going to

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,879
clean up the grow space but let's focus

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,639
on cleaning everything I just said that

118
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,478
I hung those HPS lights those HPS lights

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,519
have a glass Shield between the bulb and

120
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,079
the grow space and the heat is kept in

121
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,319
there and it's moved out by a duck so

122
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,879
that heat can never make it into the

123
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,000
Grove now is a good time to clean that

124
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,519
glass on those hoods if you've got

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,360
hooded uh lights with glass on there get

126
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,198
in turn the lights off let it cool and

127
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,960
then clean that glass it is also a good

128
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,600
time to clean your air conditioner

129
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,839
filter if your air conditioner has

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,720
filters get in there and clean those

131
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,879
filters Also let's deep clean the

132
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,039
dehumidifier that dehumidifier has

133
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,478
probably got some gunk in it let's take

134
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,918
it all apart and clean it thoroughly I'm

135
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,839
sure you've been doing the mini clean

136
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,560
the quick clean but let's give it the

137
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,119
long clean let's take it out of the room

138
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,879
take every component and part out that

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,160
you can figure out how to take out and

140
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,680
clean it very clean and put it in there

141
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,320
brand new so that we've got a fresh

142
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,639
clean dehumidifier Also let's clean up

143
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,879
the humidifier if you're not using RO

144
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,478
water your humidifier and dehumidifier

145
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,759
are going to have calcium and other

146
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,918
minerals built up in them now is a good

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
time to clean those and make them brand

148
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,478
new now since we're cleaning all of the

149
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,638
equipment it is also a good time to

150
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,560
clean out our reservoirs and all of our

151
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,280
watering equipment I don't know if

152
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,720
you've got a giant res I don't know if

153
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,839
you're using a trash can I don't know if

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,120
you've got a couple of 5 gallon buckets

155
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,918
I don't know if you're using a pitcher

156
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,918
or a water wand but however you do it

157
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:43,439
let's clean up all of our watering and

158
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,000
irrigation equipment I would recommend a

159
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:49,279
product called fizan 20 use fizan 20 as

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,240
recommended on the bottle mix that up

161
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,679
and use it to clean your Reservoir your

162
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,800
buckets uh also use it to clean your

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,038
watering pitcher if you use a watering

164
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,680
wand and a pump you can run the fisen 20

165
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,800
right through there just make make sure

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,478
to rinse and clean everything thoroughly

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,680
with clean water after using the fizan

168
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,598
let's not feed any fizan 20 to our

169
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,038
plants they will not enjoy that but it's

170
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,240
a great product it'll make everything

171
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,959
smell Hospital clean and it will remove

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,079
all of the pathogens in your watering

173
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,079
equipment so let's clean that up like I

174
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,719
said if you got a big Reservoir clean

175
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,159
that up if you got a big trash can on

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,280
Wheels clean that up if you're just

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
using buckets let's clean those up and

178
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,359
let's clean up the watering pitcher if

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,038
you just got a pitcher if you're using a

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
water wand if you're using a pitcher

181
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,560
whatever you're using let's just clean

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,840
that up make it look fresh and clean for

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
the new year that will also help you

184
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,560
mitigate problems in the future all

185
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,279
right we're talking about cleaning

186
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,879
everything also um I've got perhaps

187
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,959
maybe there are cameras in my grow space

188
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,439
when I worked in a commercial

189
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,279
environment we would have to take a day

190
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,759
just to go around and clean all of the

191
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,719
lenses on all of the cameras so if

192
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,680
you've got cameras in your grow space

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,199
get a ladder get out that cleaning rag

194
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,319
that little microfiber Rag and let's

195
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,038
clean the lenses on our cameras so that

196
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,479
we can see everything nice and clearly

197
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,279
in our grow space when we're trying to

198
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,399
creep on our grow when we're far from

199
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,638
home and making sure everything is okay

200
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,638
now that I'm talking about creeping on

201
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,199
the grow far from home let's also make

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,319
sure that all of our monitoring

203
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,038
equipment is calibrated and hung in the

204
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,039
right place sometimes I'll go into a

205
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,560
grow room and I'll notice that the uh

206
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,240
the sensors for your AC Infinity are not

207
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,240
in any useful positions the plants are

208
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,199
growing here they're about this high and

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,439
that AC Infinity the little uh the

210
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,120
sensor piece is way up here get that

211
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,120
sort of near the plant so that we kind

212
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,879
of know what's going on with the plants

213
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,759
right make sure that all of your gear is

214
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,759
in the right spot and that all of that

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,439
gear is calibrated let's check all the

216
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,240
Cycles on all of our stuff too I don't

217
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,759
know what kind of uh programmable

218
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,280
controllers you've got but let's check

219
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,280
and make sure that everything is working

220
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,000
the way we think it is run through your

221
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,158
programs run through your time make sure

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,720
everything is set the way you expect it

223
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,439
to be something might be happening in

224
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,440
there that you don't even know about

225
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,000
let's just check and verify all of our

226
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,639
settings now since we're checking and

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
verifying settings you know I'm going to

228
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,560
talk about it soon in this episode let's

229
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,199
calibrate all of our testing equipment

230
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,879
that's right if you've got a pH pen a

231
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,240
big pH meter a combo meter let's clean

232
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,720
it and calibrate that I definitely

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,360
recommend calibrating your pH meter at

234
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,919
least once a week a lot of people will

235
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,360
go two weeks some people will go longer

236
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,198
if you're working with a lot of plants

237
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,240
and mixing up a lot of nutrients you

238
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,439
definitely want that meter accurate so

239
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
clean and calibrate your PH meters as

240
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,199
often as you have time for the solution

241
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,439
is not expensive it doesn't take much

242
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,519
time uh if you do it every other morning

243
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,519
every third morning at least once a week

244
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,200
in your grow those pins will stay

245
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,320
calibrated and it will make a big

246
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,759
difference in the way your plants uptake

247
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
the nutrients if the pH is proper in

248
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,360
your feed solution so right here at the

249
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,039
start of the Year let's make it a habit

250
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,399
let's calibrate our pH pins let's clean

251
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
and calibrate our pH pins then let's get

252
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,360
a little notebook get a log and write

253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,640
down today January 1st I cleaned and

254
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,519
calibrated my pH pins I also added new

255
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,199
bulbs in this one room we're going to

256
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,200
add a lot more stuff to this little

257
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,160
notebook this journal that we talk about

258
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,360
here later in the episode let's keep it

259
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,278
moving let's calibrate our gear the pH

260
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,800
pins uh let's clean them and calibrate

261
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,919
them also let's clean our EC meters if

262
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,679
you're using an EC meter let's clean it

263
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,439
because those things will get gunky over

264
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,239
time and they work better if they're

265
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,880
clean all right where do we go from

266
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,000
there now is a good time to do inventory

267
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,600
inventory you might say yes we're going

268
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,240
to go through a lot of nutrients over

269
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,639
the next year if everything goes our way

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,320
we're going to run a few crops with a

271
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,958
lot of plants we're going to need

272
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,560
nutrients we also going to need

273
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,319
pesticides let's go in the grow and see

274
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,278
which bottles have been around for too

275
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,399
long it may need to be tossed out these

276
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,200
things do expire I would not keep

277
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,440
nutrients around for more than a year so

278
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
if you got some old [ __ ] write that down

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,880
I need to replace this bottle toss that

280
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,359
old bottle order a new bottle pick up

281
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,078
all the bottles and give them a shake

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,839
what's low do you have anything that you

283
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,838
need to replace check on your nutrients

284
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,680
check on your pesticides and let's make

285
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,079
an order and replace all of the things

286
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,199
that we're going to need for the next

287
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:01,958
couple of weeks maybe the the next grow

288
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,720
that way we've got everything on hand

289
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,639
that way there are no surprises we don't

290
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,639
run out of anything through the grow

291
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,679
cycle set yourself up for Success today

292
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,360
let's plan the whole grow ahead right

293
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,958
now while we're thinking about it now I

294
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
did say Let's do an inventory of the

295
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,919
pesticides and our nutrients Also let's

296
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,079
think about personal protective

297
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,278
equipment I'm not sure how big your grow

298
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,838
is I don't know your pesticide routine

299
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,240
if you're going to spray frequently you

300
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,079
may need a lot of tyac Suits if you only

301
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,560
spray every so often you don't need as

302
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,439
many tyac suits

303
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,239
maybe you're not even a tiac guy maybe

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
you are I like the suits it just makes

305
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,720
it nice and easy I can tuck my dreads

306
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,680
behind myself and zip it right up into

307
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,839
the suit put on some gloves some booties

308
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,319
and a mask I'm ready to rock also

309
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,200
speaking of the Mask if you're using

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,278
ventilation it may be time to order

311
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,079
those new cartridges if you've got a a

312
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,240
respirator mask let's replace the 3M

313
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,599
cartridges on our mask and on our little

314
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,759
log let's make a note I swapped out the

315
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
cartridges here read the package let's

316
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,240
see how long those cartridges are good

317
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,278
for I don't remember I don't want to

318
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,519
give you poor advice but write down when

319
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,480
you should change those and then maybe

320
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,240
order the extras now so then when it

321
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,800
comes time to change the cartridges on

322
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,039
your 3M respirator you've got backup

323
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,479
cards ready to go let's order a bunch of

324
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,439
rubber gloves while we're at it we're

325
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,720
always going to run out of gloves I go

326
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,040
through at least one or two pairs of

327
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,639
gloves every day in my grow space uh if

328
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,480
I've got a helper that's another pair of

329
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,560
gloves when you're trimming harvesting

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,879
you go through excessive gloves order a

331
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,679
box of gloves right now while you're

332
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,759
thinking about it and then see how long

333
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,799
it takes I said see how long we'll stay

334
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,879
focused see how long it takes you to run

335
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,559
through that box of gloves and then

336
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,399
order more as necessary and then you can

337
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,319
start to see what it costs and when to

338
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,200
anticipate ordering things I'm trying to

339
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,879
get you on top of staying on top of this

340
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,480
so that you can get comfortable ordering

341
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,360
things before we run out of them now

342
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,000
another good thing to think about is

343
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,079
have you tested your fire extinguisher

344
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,759
you should have a fire extinguisher near

345
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,799
or around the grow space you should have

346
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,120
one in your home anyway uh you never

347
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,519
know you can catch them [ __ ] on fire

348
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,320
while you're cooking uh you could be

349
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
taking a dab and cause a problem there

350
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,120
should be a fire extinguisher handy

351
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,719
especially if you're growing uh have you

352
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
checked on it look at that fire

353
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,920
extinguisher it's got a gauge on it it's

354
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,600
got a little red a yellow and a green if

355
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,519
it's not in the green you need to get

356
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,839
that thing charged or replaced right

357
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,399
away uh recently there was a great sale

358
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,320
on fire extinguishers I'm not

359
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,679
advertising I was at Costco and I picked

360
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,079
up two new fire extinguishers because

361
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,759
they were on a really good sale price I

362
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,638
got one that is designed for electrical

363
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,159
fires and one that was design designed

364
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,680
uh I think it's just household or all

365
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,679
around I forget the other one one is

366
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,599
specifically for electrical fires I set

367
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,719
that next to the grow space because

368
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,560
anticipate any problem would be caused

369
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
by electricity in there right so I got

370
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,359
the one for electrical fires you get

371
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,039
what you feel will best suit your needs

372
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,879
but I recommend a fire extinguisher I

373
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,360
really hope you never need it I pray a

374
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,000
jaw that I never need mine but I would

375
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,399
rather have it and not need it then need

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,198
it and not have it that's just the way I

377
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
roll set yourself up for success is what

378
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm talking about

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,240
now that fire extinguisher what else

380
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,839
could go well with that fire

381
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,600
extinguisher you say that quickly while

382
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,920
you're thinking about nine other things

383
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,680
what else do we need with the fire

384
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,000
extinguisher possibly a smoke detector a

385
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,958
smoke alarm may be a good idea the thing

386
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,720
about a smoke detector is uh when that

387
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,599
goes off are you going to be the one

388
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
that responds to that or is it going to

389
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,278
be somebody else in your area uh do you

390
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,399
have nosy neighbors are you in apart in

391
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,879
an apartment building in a condo think

392
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,278
about that sort of stuff we do want to

393
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,679
be notified of a fire but who's going to

394
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,120
notify maybe you want to be the only one

395
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,000
notified so think about that stay safe

396
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,198
but think about those sorts of things

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
now since we're talking about smoke

398
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,679
alarms that makes me think about a few

399
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,519
more security things we can think about

400
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,239
like I mentioned a moment ago I do have

401
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,879
cameras in my grow space um now is a

402
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,879
good time to go reset the passwords on

403
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,039
those cameras if you've got any sort of

404
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,078
security system uh cameras or maybe

405
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,078
anything that is accessible online

406
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,879
through a password maybe just routin L

407
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,159
go and change those passwords there's a

408
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,838
reason why a lot of services do request

409
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,838
you to update your password every so

410
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,399
often if it's your security for your

411
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,959
grow space if it's your camera for your

412
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,278
grow space if it's your AC Infiniti that

413
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,838
you're accessing maybe go change that

414
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,000
password just for Peace of Mind do it

415
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,800
often uh make sure you document that

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,399
password when you change it but go

417
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,519
change that password here at the start

418
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,919
of the year just to shake off anything

419
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,159
that may have followed you another thing

420
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,759
you can work on implementing or updating

421
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,399
here at the start of the year is your

422
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,079
integrated Pest management system what

423
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,278
have you been doing to keep bugs out of

424
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,239
your grow and what are you going to do

425
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,078
to continue keeping those bugs out of

426
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,240
your grow here in the future now is a

427
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,479
very good time to start a spray or a

428
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,680
predator bug rotation how do you want to

429
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,480
handle the bugs today is a great day to

430
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,278
start decide which products you want to

431
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,879
use order them and start applying them

432
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,519
uh together Andor in a rotation on your

433
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,320
plant on a schedule start marking that

434
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,679
down on that log or that journal that

435
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,959
we're going to talk about in just a

436
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,359
little bit then start spraying on a

437
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,879
rotation in my personal grows and

438
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,199
Commercial grows that I'm responsible

439
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,958
for I like to spray on Monday no matter

440
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,198
what if there's no problems we're going

441
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,638
to spray a preventative a pesticide

442
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,399
application on Mondays if there's any

443
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,600
hint of a problem that pest may be

444
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,440
present we're also going to spray on

445
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
Thursday we're going to apply a

446
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,560
different product possibly different

447
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,958
products in conjunction on Monday and

448
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,919
Thursday then we're going to spray again

449
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,799
on Monday and Thursday until that

450
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,120
problem is knocked down then we we will

451
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,278
resume just Monday sprays but work on

452
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,879
your Rhythm and routine for your

453
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,679
pesticide application make it regular so

454
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,720
that that way those bugs have no chance

455
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,278
of getting in there and colonizing make

456
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,440
sure you're always looking and make sure

457
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,838
you're applying pesticides or releasing

458
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,000
Predators on a regular schedule now

459
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
speaking of regular schedule here is

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
something new that I have not talked

461
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,199
about a lot uh that I probably never

462
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,879
mentioned in one of the these yearly

463
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,078
episodes where we set ourselves up for

464
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,958
success but I have recently become very

465
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,838
paranoid of hop latent vroid um I've

466
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,278
done an episode about it I am not

467
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,759
qualified to teach you uh in depth about

468
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,360
it so hopl and vroid is a virus that

469
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
came from the Hops family that's why

470
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,959
it's called hop Len vroid but cannabis

471
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,278
is Hop's very close cousin so it is

472
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,758
transferred over to the cannabis plants

473
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,679
uh this virus is um you won't even know

474
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,600
it's in your plants unless you use lab

475
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,318
testing but what will happen is you'll

476
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,800
grow your plant it'll look totally happy

477
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:35,240
totally healthy and then in midflower it

478
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,278
will just dud out and start to look weak

479
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
and bored uh it will start to look like

480
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,559
it's losing energy and it will slowly

481
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,480
die in front of you uh plants that used

482
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,719
to give you 3 lbs per light will now

483
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,680
give you A4 pound per light and you'll

484
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,519
be disappointed and angry that is

485
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,399
probably hop Laten vroid it is

486
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,679
non-detectable by the human eye youve

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,318
got to get a lab test on these plants to

488
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,879
detect the virus so I have become super

489
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,159
paranoid of incoming clones incoming

490
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,400
plants anything that comes into my grow

491
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,038
before it makes it a general population

492
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,280
it actually stops right here on this

493
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,480
table and I take a testing sample from

494
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,078
it and send that to a lab and they test

495
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,078
for the presence of hop and vroid before

496
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,599
that plant ever makes it into one of my

497
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,240
grow spaces one of my new habits that

498
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,678
I'm putting into practice here in this

499
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,838
year is I'm lab testing every plant

500
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,839
before it makes it to the grow and I am

501
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,200
also regularly that means every 6 to 8

502
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,399
weeks I am testing plants in my grow to

503
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,759
make sure nobody is snuck in any hopl

504
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,280
and vroid along the way I did start

505
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,038
testing my plants recently for hlv but

506
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,798
here at the start of the year I will be

507
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,119
much more scheduled and much more

508
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,119
methodical in keeping all of my plants

509
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,000
tested for the presence of hopl and

510
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,599
vroid maybe that is something you want

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,839
to implement maybe you want to test your

512
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,918
plants randomly something I definitely

513
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,240
recommend is testing any incoming clones

514
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,120
and if you've seen any plants in your

515
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,720
grow they look like they're like if

516
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,599
you've got 10 plants and two of them are

517
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,400
just kind of growing like [ __ ] now is

518
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,599
the time to get those tested and see if

519
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,919
they have the virus because that virus

520
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,359
will spread through your grow rapidly we

521
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,120
can talk a lot more about that on a

522
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,719
future episode but it may be a good time

523
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:15,519
to implement hop lat and vroid testing

524
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,839
in your protocol all right now so far in

525
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,558
this podcast I feel like I've been

526
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,678
talking about physical changes we can

527
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:24,119
make to our Grow rooms to set ourselves

528
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,759
up for success in 2024 let's shift gears

529
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,959
and talk more about planning and

530
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,839
strategy that we can put into place to

531
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,360
set our ourselves up for success in our

532
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,119
grow rooms everything successful starts

533
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,439
off with a good plan and a solid goal so

534
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,759
let's start by making plans and goals

535
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,880
for our grow room one of the first plans

536
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,079
and goals I would put into place is how

537
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,600
many harvests do you want to pull from

538
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,759
your grow this year I don't know how

539
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,480
many flowering rooms or flowering tents

540
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,558
you've got I don't know how much veg

541
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,200
space you've got but think about how

542
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,480
many harvests do you realistically want

543
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,440
to pull from your grow space this year

544
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,679
we've got 365 days to work with if

545
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,000
you've got a dedicated flowering room

546
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,159
and you put plants in there for 63 days

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,319
which is 9 weeks which most plants are

548
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,799
finished in about 9 weeks you can

549
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:16,038
probably pull 5.7 Harvest from that

550
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,960
dedicated flowering room now that means

551
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,200
there's no downtime there's not a day of

552
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,600
downtime there are no breaks can you

553
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,640
make that happen can you get that 5.7

554
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,519
harvests from that room most people

555
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
would be happy with five complete

556
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,400
harvests from one flowering room in a

557
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,279
year I would be happy with that if you

558
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,720
could get that 7 out of there and be

559
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,399
halfway through a harvest at the end of

560
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,279
the year that is a big win but let's

561
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,080
think about it now how many harvests do

562
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,158
you want to pull from that room do you

563
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,720
have a dedicated veg space if you want

564
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,960
5.7 Harvest from that flower room you

565
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,200
will need a dedicated veg space to where

566
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,679
you can pull down a crop move plants in

567
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,440
the same day and keep going and then get

568
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,240
that veg space active again to where

569
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,400
when we pull down that flower room the

570
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,079
veg space goes right back in there let's

571
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,360
think about how many Harvest we want to

572
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,079
pull realistically you don't have to do

573
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,959
5.7 per year this is up to you and now

574
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,960
is the time to think about it if you've

575
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,798
only got one flowering room do you want

576
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
to do a Perpetual cycle to where you're

577
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,000
taking down so many plants uh every two

578
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,519
weeks every 3 weeks every 30 days now is

579
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,400
the time to start thinking about those

580
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,480
plants and put them into place at the

581
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,280
start of the new year also I would think

582
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,919
about how many plants are going to go

583
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,399
into that room or into each tent how

584
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,320
often then start thinking about how many

585
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,000
mother plants do I need to supply clones

586
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,158
for this many flowering rooms this often

587
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,720
then there's the other thing to think

588
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,000
about are you going to run clones are

589
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,600
you going to run seeds now is a good

590
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,240
time to really start thinking about

591
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,158
strategy realistically think it takes me

592
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,679
this long to veg the plants as big as I

593
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,360
want them the plants I like to run take

594
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,600
this long in flower how do I prepare to

595
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,798
always have plants in my flower room and

596
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,038
always have plants in my vegro ready to

597
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,639
fill those spaces without overloading

598
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,679
myself and possibly without going over

599
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,600
your legal numbers now is a good time to

600
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,559
think about that and the new year is a

601
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,759
great time to start a new Perpetual

602
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,720
project also it may sound wild but now

603
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,558
is a good time to start thinking about

604
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,440
your outdoor crop I know we've got five

605
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:16,200
six maybe seven months before we can put

606
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,159
Plants outdoors in many areas but it is

607
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,278
never too early to start thinking about

608
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,520
that outdoor crop are you going to run

609
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,319
seeds and put those Outdoors this year

610
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,319
you could start seeds now in January you

611
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,319
could veg them you can take a clone from

612
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,599
them you can either flower the Clone or

613
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,038
the vegged plant you can sex the plants

614
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,399
this way find out if they're boys or

615
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,278
girls you can run these plants one time

616
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,519
and see what is the keeper phenotype

617
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,759
what would do best outside you can make

618
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,440
that selection and by March or April

619
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,679
you'll have your decisions made of what

620
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,200
should go outside then when May or June

621
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,559
comes around you've already got clones

622
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,519
prepared then you can veg those uh if

623
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,359
you start now you may be able to veg

624
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,519
some plants 5 6 or 7 ft tall if you've

625
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,759
got the ability indoors and put them out

626
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,119
as monsters when they go out side and

627
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,038
that's how you achieve those big

628
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,359
California monster plants that we see on

629
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,759
the internet all right so now is a good

630
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,959
time to start thinking about that

631
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,759
outdoor crop that is coming up in 6 or 7

632
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,519
months another huge way we can set

633
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,278
ourselves up for success in this year's

634
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,440
grow is by reflecting on what we did

635
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,038
last year did you take notes on last

636
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,840
year's growth if it was indoors if it

637
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,038
was Outdoors if you've been growing for

638
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:26,038
many years or just one year or maybe

639
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,038
even just one grow did you take notes

640
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,000
what were you happy with what were you

641
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,839
unsatisfied with what did you do very

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,440
well what do you not do very well are

643
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,720
you taking notes do you know where you

644
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,360
can improve do you know where you're

645
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,640
killing it do you know what you can do

646
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,199
better do you know where you're wasting

647
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,520
money are you taking notes let's take a

648
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,159
minute to reflect on last year's grow

649
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,038
and see how we can improve this year's

650
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,159
crop I think if we take a minute to

651
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,400
identify what our weak point is in the

652
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,320
growth space then we can really improve

653
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,038
upon that and then we can really step up

654
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,599
our entire game in the grow everybody's

655
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,158
got one thing they're not not good at in

656
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,359
the grow don't be ashamed don't feel

657
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,640
embarrassed by it the thing to do is

658
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,000
study that one thing a lot of people are

659
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,880
not good at taking clones uh I have got

660
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,558
a very good clone sop on my Discord if

661
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,640
you join the Discord I'll show you how

662
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,798
to find that clone cutting sop many

663
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,840
people find great success using that

664
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,480
clone sop so if cloning isn't your game

665
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,480
reach out we can help you learn to

666
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,679
become a better cloner if drying and

667
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
curing isn't your thing study drying and

668
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,440
curing if you don't think you're good at

669
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,960
identifying a deficiency in a plant

670
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,919
maybe that's the area you need to do

671
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,000
some research in then by the end of the

672
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,038
year you'll be the deficiency

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,119
identification expert you'll walk into a

674
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,558
grow and you'll go that plant needs CAG

675
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,918
that plant's had too much phosphorus

676
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:43,038
you're way giving that plant too much

677
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,640
nitrogen why is it so cold in here

678
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,400
you'll become that guy just do a little

679
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
bit of studying and pick up the

680
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,320
knowledge that you need in the area that

681
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,359
you are lacking I will admit that the

682
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,038
area I could use the most Improvement

683
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,519
and is probably understanding lighting

684
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,440
when it comes to yumul PO Jewel and all

685
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,319
those colors and all those graphs

686
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,558
something in my brain doesn't give a

687
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,278
[ __ ] to learn about that I care a lot

688
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,558
about photosynthesis I understand

689
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,319
nutrients I understand the the breeding

690
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,918
techniques I understand a lot of the

691
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,240
cycles and processes of the plant but

692
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,440
when it comes to understanding the

693
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,079
lighting my brain doesn't care to learn

694
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,679
all of that so that's probably where I

695
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,918
need to do the most Improvement is

696
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,759
learning about lighting what's your weak

697
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,480
area I admitted mine don't be

698
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,359
embarrassed let's work on it and get

699
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,839
better at it together in 2024 I know

700
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,558
everybody's got that one thing that they

701
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,959
need to work on but what else can you

702
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,639
improve in the grow I'm sure there are a

703
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,360
few small details uh maybe you're not

704
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,679
taking time to clean up after yourself

705
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,599
like me maybe you're not phing properly

706
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,080
maybe uh you're in a rush on one thing

707
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,038
maybe you're not paying attention to one

708
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,119
detail let's take a minute and look at

709
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,319
the grow and look at our processes and

710
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,599
see what we can improve on what are you

711
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,558
doing in that grow that is just habit

712
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:54,319
what are you doing that is just ritual

713
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,359
are the things you're doing in your grow

714
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,079
space in your uh in your standard

715
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,119
operating procedure every day day when

716
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,918
you go in there you check the room you

717
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,000
look at the plants you do your thing I

718
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
don't know what you're doing in there we

719
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,038
all have our own uh method to our

720
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,360
Madness in there but in your standard

721
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,440
operating procedure does everything make

722
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,119
sense is there a move in there that

723
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,798
you're doing like I said that is just a

724
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,519
ritual that is just because do you know

725
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:19,480
why you're doing everything that you're

726
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,519
doing you might be able to eliminate

727
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,599
certain processes certain steps maybe

728
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,960
even certain products in your grow if

729
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,839
you just take a step back and analyze

730
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,159
what you're doing in there dayby day in

731
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,599
your standard operating procedure maybe

732
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,159
you're doing something weird because you

733
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,038
learned it from your hippie Uncle who

734
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,039
learned it from his hippie uncle and

735
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,759
nobody has any idea why you're doing it

736
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,278
you just heard that it works pay

737
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,319
attention check on that stuff see if

738
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,440
it's some actual stuff or if it's just

739
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,839
habit or Voodoo or a ritual that is

740
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,519
making you feel good is it really doing

741
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,959
something let's also think about the

742
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,319
money we're spending in there are we

743
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,159
being cost effective in the grow are all

744
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,000
the products you're buying providing

745
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,278
some sort of value to the grow are they

746
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
adding some sort of value to the outcome

747
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:03,480
also think about your time in there um I

748
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,960
don't think about the time that I'm in

749
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,399
my grow as being uh hours on the clock

750
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
or uh part of the cost of growing that

751
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:13,079
product because I love being in there

752
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,599
that's my zen space also it's been

753
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:16,798
really cold and it's nice and warm in

754
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,278
the grow so if it's middle of the day

755
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,720
and I've been out running errands and I

756
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:20,960
come home and I'm [ __ ] freezing

757
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,919
sometimes I just go in the grow and

758
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,000
defoliate just to warm up I'll be in

759
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,038
there just doing it but if you're a

760
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,440
working person who is using this grow as

761
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,558
part of an come document your time in

762
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,558
there see where you can streamline your

763
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,079
time if you can't be in there all day

764
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,079
I've got the freedom the ability the

765
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:38,918
lifestyle to spend as much time as I

766
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,119
really want to in my grow with limits

767
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,038
you know but many people don't have that

768
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,798
luxury uh we've got families jobs uh

769
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,158
careers Hobbies relationships uh all of

770
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,480
the above that keep us busy so think

771
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:52,640
about the time that you're in there and

772
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,200
see if you are making the most of your

773
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,278
time in that growth space like I said

774
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,200
before if you've got weird rituals or

775
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,038
whatever maybe we can eliminate those

776
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,120
and focus and get in that grow and do

777
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,679
what needs to be done and get out and

778
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,639
even make the grow more efficient by

779
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,519
doing so now I did touch on this part

780
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,840
several times here in this episode one

781
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,960
thing I definitely recommend if if you

782
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,319
were comfortable with this if you were

783
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,720
in a legal state if you're in a

784
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,639
proabition area do this part very

785
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,640
carefully possibly if you choose to do

786
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,000
this but I like to keep a grow Journal

787
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,000
um I keep a simple notepad in my phone I

788
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,919
use the notes app in my iPhone and I've

789
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,720
got little notes that are headline with

790
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,080
each grow space my grow rooms all have

791
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,240
names uh and each grow room with each

792
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,158
name I've got a different list of notes

793
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,120
that I've done in that room I just keep

794
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
track of what I've done um

795
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,000
hypothetically we'll say today that I

796
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,600
fed that room uh 10 gallons of water

797
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,759
then I'd write down each nutrient that I

798
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,240
put in that water I'd write down the pH

799
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,079
of the solution then I would write down

800
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,558
the EC then I would water I'd probably

801
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,759
write down the temperature and humidity

802
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,879
of the room too as I documented it as I

803
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,599
was watering just making random notes

804
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,679
all of that [ __ ] is kept in my AC

805
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,278
Infinity little monitor there but I

806
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,880
wrote it down too so if I want to go

807
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:05,599
look it's there in my notes what I fed

808
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,720
it the AC Infinity didn't write down

809
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,639
what I fed it I knew the temp and

810
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,880
humidity at a certain time I wrote down

811
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
what I fed it uh I know wrote down what

812
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,559
time I fed it what date so if I see a

813
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,240
problem in a few days I can go well what

814
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,000
did I feed it and I can look back and I

815
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,960
go oh I [ __ ] up and gave it too much

816
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,119
calag I gave it calag two feedings in a

817
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,558
row didn't need to do that I see the

818
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,678
issue if I defoliate I'll write down I

819
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,319
defoliated the room really heavily or

820
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,038
really lightly if I notice something a

821
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,639
small presence of fungus snats I'll

822
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,679
write that sort of [ __ ] down um don't

823
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,600
forget to buy this I also make myself

824
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,278
notes like that but start a grow Journal

825
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
write down definitely write down the day

826
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,200
a clone was cut write down the day a

827
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,480
seed was germinated write down the day

828
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,240
that that clone or seed went into dirt

829
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,519
write down the next day you transplanted

830
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,399
that write down the day that it went

831
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,319
into flow uh write down the day that you

832
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,599
change the timer if you make changes

833
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,038
write that down if I adjust my air

834
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,359
conditioner up or down one or two

835
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,558
degrees I write that down if I change

836
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,959
the humidifier the dehumidifier I write

837
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,119
that down everything gets documented so

838
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,840
that when I'm looking at the plants and

839
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,359
I go what the [ __ ] happened I don't

840
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,158
wonder what the [ __ ] happened it's

841
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,759
somewhere in the notes I just got to

842
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,000
read and say oh on this day I turned up

843
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,158
the [ __ ] air conditioner or I turned

844
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
down the dehumidifier and everything

845
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,760
went to [ __ ] three days later maybe this

846
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,120
has something to do with it just save

847
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,759
some sort of notes give yourself some

848
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,879
sort of Journal set yourself up for

849
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,278
success that way if you have problems

850
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,960
you can look back and see what you did

851
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,480
wrong but also if you grow the best weed

852
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,519
you've ever grown you've already got the

853
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,519
blueprint you can do it all over again

854
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,440
repeat everything you did in the last

855
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,640
cycle so one thing I definitely

856
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
recommend is keeping a grow Journal you

857
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,919
can get many beautiful great journals on

858
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,480
Amazon if you're the kind of person that

859
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,320
writes stuff down you can get a plain uh

860
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,319
notebook paper notebook if you want you

861
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,278
can get one of those mol skin journals

862
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,079
you can just use the iPhone you can use

863
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,880
Google Docs however you want to do it

864
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,599
how ever you feel comfortable with in

865
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
your environment like I said if you're

866
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,839
in a Prohibition State those notes may

867
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,079
be used against you in a court of law so

868
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,439
be careful with that but it's safe and

869
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,079
legal here in Colorado we're actually

870
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,360
required in a commercial grow we're

871
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,038
required to document all the pesticides

872
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,240
we apply we're required to document

873
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,398
defoliation weight uh we even have to

874
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,278
document how much trash we take out of

875
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,038
the grow space so just get in the habit

876
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,759
of documenting things it will be good

877
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,679
for you if if that is something you're

878
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,319
comfortable with in your area all right

879
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,000

890
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,240
reflect the uh the input that you did in

891
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,798
that grow if you're not there enough if

892
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,638
you're just growing it just to grow it

893
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,398

those plants the love that they deserve

899
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,558
give them the care that they deserve if

900
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,960
you're anxious nervous having a bad day

901
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:14,798

902
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,880
traffic maybe you're having a a fight

903

904
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,760
uh stole your shoes I'm just making [ __ ]

905
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,319
up if something went wrong and you're

906
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,480
not uh physically mentally spiritually

907
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,240
right maybe don't go in there and spread

908
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,639
that stress to the plants unless going

909
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,359
in there does give you that feeling of

910
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,439
relief my grow space is my zen space uh

911
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,798
the air conditioner and the blower is so

912
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,759
loud in there that I can't hear you if

913
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,119
you're talking anyway I don't pay

914
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,079
attention to the phone very much when

915
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,839
I'm in there so I can't hear [ __ ] I'm

916
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,199
just zoned out listening to the blowers

917
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,038
listening to the fans watching the

918
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,480
leaves Russell that is my zen space so

919
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,919
don't think about stressful negative

920
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,639
[ __ ] when you're in the grow space don't

921
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,679
think about your wallet don't think

922
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,359
about how much money this crop is going

923
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,600
to be worth when it's harvested don't

924
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,199
think like that think about how good

925
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,599
people are going going to feel when they

926
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,798
consume this product that you put your

927
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,678
time your energy your love and your care

928
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,119

929
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,360
growing good ganja so like I said before
