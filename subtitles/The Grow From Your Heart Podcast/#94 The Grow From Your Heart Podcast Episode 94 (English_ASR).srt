50
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,219
stuff like that but first I want to talk

51
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,629
about my weekend man I get to see my

52
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,219
favorite band if you guys know me you

53
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,810
know that my favorite band is Phish I

54
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,429
got to see - Phish shows over the

55
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,280
weekend I saw Saturday and Sunday night

56
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,490
at the Dick's Sporting Goods park in

57
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,159
Commerce City Colorado Saturday was a

58
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,599
pretty good show but sunday was a really

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,978
spectacular show they did some great

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,039
songs they did stuff they haven't played

61
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,390
in several years the band sounded great

62
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,829
the crowd was in a good mood everything

63
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,539
was amazing

64
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,040
the only thing that kind of sucked and

65
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,259
it didn't suck really but my favorite

66
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,179
song from fish I think my favorite song

67
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:23,590
is called punch you in the high and the

68
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,960
middle section of punch you in the eye

69
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,060
is a jam that has been labeled the

70
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,129
landlady the landlady was written first

71
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,780
punch you in the eye was written the

72
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,069
landlady was dropped into the middle of

73
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,740
punch you in the high as the groove

74
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,469
portion and it's always been played as

75
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,780
one piece since then but on Sunday night

76
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,520
they opened with the landlady which is

77
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,960
the middle section of my favorite song

78
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,610
so it was a little disappointing knowing

79
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,980
that I wasn't gonna hear my favorite

80
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,480
song through the whole weekend but it

81
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,429
was okay because they made up for it by

82
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,719
playing some like I said some old songs

83
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,950
that I haven't heard in a long time and

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,319
stuff that they have not played in

85
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:59,649
several years if anybody hears a fish

86
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,060
fan they played harpoon WA that means a

87
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,710
lot to people if you're a fish fan they

88
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,210
don't play our pool very often and when

89
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,950
they do play hard pool it's a really

90
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,270
great thing so that's enough rambling

91
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,339
about the fish concert I had a great

92
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,600
time big shout out to fish they put on a

93
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,670
hell of a show it was the end of the

94
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,039

95
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,750

96
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,849

97
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,139

DAB all of us that are dabbing are

216
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,569
thinking about all of the people that

217
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,480
are at work or wherever they are on the

218
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:01,069
bus uh in a taxi if you're in an uber

219
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,870
you can probably smoke some weed

220
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,219
most super drivers don't give a [ __ ] if

221
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,720
you smoke out there Hoover ride so if

222

for joining me for a DAB all right I've

241
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,520
been talking about some news articles

242
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,860
and I've been rambling for a few minutes

243
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,199
so let's open up these news articles and

244
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,819
just to uh just for a disclaimer I know

245
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,409
that earlier in a future in a past

246
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,629
episode I said that I was gonna get more

247
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,070
into grow lessons I will do that I have

248
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,990
been doing that I've got a lot of stuff

249
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,389
coming up I've got a CBD episode coming

250
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,889
up I've got a few episodes in the works

251
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,599
that are partial episodes I'm taking

252
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,579
notes and getting [ __ ] ready but there

253
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,290
has been so much news that I feel it's

254
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,740
my responsibility to bring this news to

255
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,290
you so here comes the first news article

256
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,509
I found this article on the cannabis and

257
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,090
it was written by John Murray of the

258
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,889
Denver Post the headline says Denver's

259
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,110
social pot use plans are getting

260
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,149
overhauled the saw the headline says the

261
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,800
idea isn't dead backers of the proposal

262
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,899
say they will join talks with city and

263
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,620
business leaders to try to work out a

264
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,848
compromise so the article goes like this

265
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,440
activists behind a proposed Denver

266
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,850
ballot initiative to allow some

267
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,500
marijuana use in bars and other

268
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,120
businesses say they will pull the

269
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,580
measure the Denver Post has confirmed

270
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,889
their new goal crafting a compromise

271
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,870
measure with city and business leaders

272
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,699
the verbal agreement with a group that

273
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,799
includes city attorney Scott Martinez

274
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,270
averts a public vote in November one

275
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,159
that might have allowed more extensive

276
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,799
pot consumption in publicly accessible

277
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,620
places than city officials and some

278
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,609
business leaders were comfortable with

279
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,679
Mason divert of the Marijuana Policy

280
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,570
Project said fellow backers of the

281
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,729
limited social cannabis use initiative

282
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,710
plan to announce the withdrawal Thursday

283
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,870
before Friday's expected certification

284
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,519
of the measure for the November 3rd

285
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,899
ballot

286
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,669
activists now will shift to working with

287
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,439
city officials and the state restaurant

288
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,669
and Lodging Association to work out an

289
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,380
ordinance that they hope will be

290
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,120
considered by the Denver Council or by

291
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,340
the City Council excuse me within the

292
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,049
next year the downtown Denver

293
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,420
partnership which represents business

294
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,049
interests in that area also plans to

295
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,909
take part

296
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,529
we're not approaching the withdrawal of

297
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,809
this initiative lightly said to virt who

298
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,909
also was a co-author of Colorado's

299
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,369
marijuana legalizing amendment 64 in

300
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:52,279
2012 we believe that cannabis users

301
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,820
derive deserve the freedom and uh let me

302
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,338
try that again

303
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,170
we believe that cannabis users deserve

304
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,510
the freedom to congregate and socialize

305
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,189
to the same extent as alcohol users any

306
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,990
guys I'm gonna interject here when we

307
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,360
set up this cannabis system that we have

308
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,299
the whole model they modeled it after

309
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,519
was to make it like alcohol they wanted

310
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:12,799
to regulate it like alcohol and we're

311
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,809
all able to go to so many places and

312
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,549
drink alcohol all night long why aren't

313
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:18,259
there a few places for us to go and take

314
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,000
some dabs and smoke some flowers and

315
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:21,649
hang out with our friends we don't

316
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,970
always have to be at my house sitting at

317
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,399
the dab table we should be able to go

318
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,990
somewhere else there are so many stoners

319
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,490
out there that I don't know because

320
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,350
they're all at their house on their

321
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,879
couch taking dabs cuz they don't come to

322
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,830
my house and sit on my couch and take

323
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,990
dabs so we're never gonna meet if we had

324
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,460
a social club we'd go meet each other so

325
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,200
that way when somebody got tired of

326
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,910
smoking what am i smoking if I got tired

327
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,259
of smoking candy cush I could go trade

328
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:44,449
them I can't be cush for some of their

329
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,799
OG Kush or whatever I'm just making a

330
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,450
nice little community a nice little

331
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,659
Network I'm gonna keep on with the

332
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,009
article it says they found ready support

333
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:54,079
in the ballot petitioning process

334
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,819
turning in ten thousand seven hundred

335
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,620
signatures more than twice as many as

336
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,000
needed although Denver police have shut

337
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,740
down private cannabis clubs of the

338
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,938
city's Marijuana Policy office this year

339
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,918
began examining

340
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:05,808
as an evolving regulatory need to the

341
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:08,088
potential of allowing some social use of

342
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:10,009
marijuana the idea came up in council

343
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,720
race lap races last spring with some

344
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,788
successful candidates open to the idea

345
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,379
in part because tourists lacked places

346
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:17,418
to consume their purchases legally

347
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,158
that's very true you guys you can come

348
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:20,568
to Colorado and if you're not from here

349
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:22,428
if you've got an out-of-state license

350
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:24,318
you can purchase up to 7 grams of

351
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:26,478
cannabis you can purchase up to 7 grams

352
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:28,278
of hash you can purchase 7 grams total

353
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:30,769
in any combination of edibles hash

354
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:31,938
tinctures and topicals but what you

355
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:34,428
can't do once you've made the purchase

356
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:36,108
there's nowhere to [ __ ] smoke you

357
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:37,668
can't go to the hotel and smoke because

358
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:39,649
they don't allow smoking you can't go to

359
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:41,838
the park because that's illegal unless

360
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,369
you know somebody you just have all this

361
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,479
cannabis that you can't smoke and you're

362
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,918
not allowed to take it to your home

363
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:48,049
state to smoke it because it's illegal

364
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:50,720
to travel across state lines with it so

365
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:52,009
I think that this smoking lounge type of

366
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
an environment is something that we

367
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,999
really really need I'll continue with

368
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,559
the article it says but city efforts

369
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,538
were in early stages when to virt and

370
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:01,608
bran vicinity of cannabis focused law

371
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:04,068
firm vicente sinner burg both frustrated

372
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:07,038
with what they saw as an action began to

373
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:08,598
push for the initiative to ver and

374
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:10,489
several people involved in the recent

375
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:12,408
talk say it's too soon to predict what

376
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:14,509
will result options could range from a

377
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:15,948
narrow ordinance allows private clubs to

378
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,298
a more extensive law that would break

379
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,639
new ground in colorado by allowing

380
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:22,239
patrons of some bars to vape inside or

381
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,459
smoke outside as the initiative proposed

382
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:27,288
the initiative withdrawal ensures we now

383
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,788
have the time and ability to include all

384
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,588
interested stakeholders to reach

385
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:33,348
consensus on this important issue said

386
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:35,149
councilman Albus Brooks who represents

387
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:37,158
most of downtown I'm committed to

388
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,688
working on a broadly acceptable solution

389
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:40,220
but finding common ground for an

390
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:41,928
expansion of the current law which

391
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,298
restricts consumption mostly to private

392
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:46,519
residence might prove tricky there's

393
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,989
also the chance that a consensus

394
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,470
proposal won't go far enough for the

395
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:52,970
activists while Mayor Michael Hancock

396
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,619
administration took no position on the

397
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,329
proposed initiative the City Attorney's

398
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,339
Office questioned the legality of its

399
00:12:56,328 --> 00:13:00,198
scope given state laws against public

400
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,079
consumption that its lawyers viewed as

401
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,998
conflicting and Sonya Riggs president

402
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,219
and CEO of the Colorado Restaurant

403
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,319
Association expressed adamant opposition

404
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,059
on behalf of about half of the state's

405
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:13,009
restaurants in part based on concerns

406
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,088
that insurers might drop coverage of all

407
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,269
restaurants because of liability

408
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,130
concerns

409
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,769
this week the Colorado Hotel and Lodging

410
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,809
Association metro Denver lodging council

411
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,669
and Colorado Restaurant Association said

412
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,589
in a statement that they appreciated the

413
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,719
activists withdrawal of the initiative

414
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,280
our respective industries are committed

415
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,810
to working with the promote the

416
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,309
proponents and the city to find a

417
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,109
solution that reflects the interests and

418
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:36,509
concerns of all stakeholders their

419
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,039
statement said the proposed initiative

420
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,840
divided Denver restaurant and bar owners

421
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,269
who would have had the option to allow

422
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,590
marijuana use Riggs said Wednesday that

423
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,370
she would approach the discussion with

424
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,110
an open mind

425
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,669
I do understand there's a concern from

426
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,529
their part that they need to have that

427
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:51,479
they need to have addressed she said of

428
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,059
initiative backers just as there's a

429
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,409
concern from our side for their part

430
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,269
city officials say they can't offer

431
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,919
assurances they also plan to gather

432
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,750
input from neighborhood and community

433
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,759
groups on the issue we can't guarantee

434
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,110
an outcome on it obviously but it's

435
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,000
something we've been looking at said

436
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,009
Ashlee Kilroy Hancock's executive

437
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,570
director for Marijuana Policy we do

438
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,009
believe that there's area for a

439
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,290
conversation around this and that

440
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:14,759
there's a lot of other considerations

441
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:16,500
where Tina said his office isn't drawing

442
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,960
bright lines allowing policy makers to

443
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,490
consider all options first I'm not going

444
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,950
to throw down the legal hammer until we

445
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,879
were specific

446
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,770
proposals he said until there are

447
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,899
specific proposals he said sorry the

448
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,569
word proposals is out of the quotations

449
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,980
so that was confusing until our specific

450
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,510
proposals he said adding we're all

451
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,159
working to find clarity within the law

452
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,289
so that people can operate with

453
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,730
certainty if activists are dissatisfied

454
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:41,009
with the coming decisions though they

455
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,230
will have a fallback option going back

456
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:45,389
to the ballot on their own next year in

457
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,220
a presidential election that probably

458
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:49,409
will have wider turnout than this fall

459
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,480
divert sees an even greater change for

460
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,279
passage but he said a successful

461
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,190
compromise with city officials and other

462
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,230
interests has more likely to result in a

463
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,180
law that we know the city would be

464
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,629
comfortable with and will not resist and

465
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,939
will actually implement so they pulled

466
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,110
their ballot so that they can rewrite it

467
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,000
to where they can actually make it a

468
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,039
little bit more fair for the businesses

469
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,769
and for the people who want to consume

470
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,599
so the law or the proposal is not dead

471
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,909
they're going to rewrite it and they're

472
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,680
gonna try again it sounds like the city

473
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:21,870
of Denver wants to work with the

474
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,399
cannabis consumers it seems like they

475
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,100
understand of the revenue that is

476
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,049
available they understand the need and

477
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,129
they mentioned in this article that out

478
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,750
of Staters don't have

479
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,730
were to consume which is the main

480
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,620
problem here if those out-of-staters had

481
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,210
somewhere to consume they would go there

482
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,379
they would consume and then they're

483
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,580
gonna get hungry they're gonna get

484
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,320
thirsty and they're going to need

485
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,720
entertainment which is going to cause

486
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,940
them or and not cause them but yeah will

487
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,310
cause them to go spend more money and

488
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,560
participate in our economy and be part

489
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,419
of our state's cash flow a little better

490
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,559
all right guys I gotta go blow my nose

491
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,669

495
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:00,689
this week I'm catching a little bit of a

496
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,129
head cold I'm trying to fight it off but

497

498
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,100

500
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,190

00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,019
I appreciate you guys for tolerating my

502
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,700
a little bit of sniffles and a little

503
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,960
bit of a nasally voice all right I've

504
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,629
got another news article here for you

505
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,360
guys this is grounds for celebration

506
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:21,000
this may become a holiday in Colorado if

507
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,860
they continue to do this annually the

508
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,110
article here came from the cannabis and

509
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,389
it was written by Kristen Wyatt from The

510
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,330
Associated Press and the headline says

511
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:33,059
get ready for the one day tax holiday on

512
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,170
Colorado weed excuse me guys I gotta

513
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,789
take a drink here then we'll get the

514
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:40,079
show on the road all right so the sub

515
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,969
headline says we're thinking there will

516
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,430
be huge crowds says a shop owner about

517
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,410
the September 16 break on the hefty

518
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:48,870
Colorado marijuana tax on recreational

519
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:51,029
weed thanks to the Tabor law all right

520
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,399
so that sounds confusing to a lot of

521
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,889
people but taxes are ridiculously high

522
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,829
on cannabis here in Colorado and we're

523
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,870
going to have a 1 day tax free cannabis

524
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,740
day in Colorado let me read the article

525
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,140
I'll explain it to you

526
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,000
Colorado is unusual tax laws forcing the

527
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,430
state to suspend taxes on recreational

528
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,559
marijuana for one day the sales tax

529
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,810
break down the sales tax break on

530
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,740
September 16th will save $20 off the

531
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,629
prices of a mid-grade

532
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,970
ounce of pot in the Denver area were

533
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,730
ounces this summer sell for about $200

534
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,709
before tax it's unusual for a state that

535
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,390
has many times rejected sales tax

536
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,339
holidays on things like school supplies

537
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,740
clothing or any of energy efficient

538
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:31,679
appliances officials say it could cost

539
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,779
the state 3 to 4 million dollars in one

540
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,850
day you guys they're going to lose 3 to

541
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,509
4 million dollars in taxes in a single

542
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,399
day

543
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,200
the article goes on to say at first I

544
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,030
was in disbelief we were doing this said

545
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
Cheri Hackett who owns botanic air a

546
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,420
dispensary in the Denver suburb of

548
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,680
Charon not boat an acre the nutrient

549
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,509
line it's two separate businesses once

550
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,830
our lawyer said no we really are doing

551
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,589
this we started getting ready or

552
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:57,699
thinking there will be huge crowds

553
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:59,829
packet is bringing science to alert

554
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,019
customers to the holiday and is trying

555
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,599
to boost inventory for a one day crush

556
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,309
of businesses Colorado's taxpayer Bill

557
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,919
of Rights requires voter approval for

558
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:10,899
new taxes in 2013 a year after

559
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,000
legalizing recreational pot voters

560
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,680
approved the 25 percent taxes but the

561
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,450
law requires that any new taxes be

562
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,250
waived and refunded of overall State

563
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,319
collections exceed projections given to

564
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,420
voters when they approved the new taxes

565
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,769
in this case the pot taxes were

566
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,519
projected to raise seventy million

567
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,470
dollars in 2014 they actually raised 58

568
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,180
million dollars but because overall tax

569
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,910
collections that year exceeded protected

570
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,680
projections Colorado must ask voters for

571
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,180
permission to keep the money and it

572
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,400
comply with the requirement that the

573
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:43,150
taxes revert to zero lawmakers settled

574
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,490
on a short one day tax waiver that day

575
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,920
is September 16th one day after the

576
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,930
state's books for the previous fiscal

577
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,850
year are made final all right so if you

578
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,279
guys want to come to Colorado and buy a

579
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:56,500
quarter of cannabis at a shop September

580
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,899
16th would be your day to do it there

581
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,730
will be no taxes marijuana won't be

582
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,190
completely tax free that day a regular

583
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,200
2.9 percent sales tax still applies as

584
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:09,160
new medical marijuana taxes and local

585
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,779
pot taxes all right so the extra local

586
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,330
taxes that we pay here in Pueblo will

587
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,160
still be tacked on for pot retailers the

588
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,599
holiday poses a bizarre supply dilemma

589
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,790
don't want plenty of weed on hand to

590
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,109
sell to throngs of pot shoppers but if

591
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,359
they stock too much product they'll

592
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:24,129
forego their one-day waiver on the 15%

593
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,679
excise tax that they pay marijuana

594
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,970
wholesalers a savvy retailer would want

595
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,830
to have shelves full enough to supply

596
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,450
crowds but bare enough to take maximum

597
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:33,879
of an advantage of the restocking

598
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,509
without paying excise taxes before the

599
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,100
business closes September 16 Ryan Fox

600
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,140
who owns two denver dispensaries and

601
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:42,699
also a wholesale pot growing company

602
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,440
hasn't decided what sorts of deals to

603
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,539
offer that day but he's anticipating a

604
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,070
windfall our hopes are high and we're

605
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,319
going to push as hard as we can to see

606
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,418
as many customers as we can Fox said

607
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,178
Colorado voters will decide in November

608
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:56,919
whether to keep the pot taxes the 2013

609
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,019
taxing measure passed two to one and

610
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,240
state politicians seem confident voters

611
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,220
will reauthorize the taxes the state

612
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,278
constitution requires refunds only in a

613
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,620
new tax and in new taxes first year so

614
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,669
voters won't be asked again all right I

615
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,819
read that a little weird so I'm gonna

616
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,889
read that last line again it says the

617
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:17,678
state constitution requires refunds only

618
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:19,629
any new taxes first year so voters won't

619
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,490
be asked again I kind of read that funny

620
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,649
the first time but this only comes up

621
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,659
when a tax is in its first year so they

622
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:27,459
won't be asking us this again the one

623
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:29,019
day tax break won't put too much of a

624
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,028
dent in the state's overall pot revenue

625
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,519
Colorado's pot collections are blooming

626
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:35,409
marijuana tax read revenues jumped from

627
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,740
25 million in the first five months of

628
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:40,690
2014 to 44 million in the first five

629
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,548
months of this year the increase has

630
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,519
been attributed to additional stores

631
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:48,849
opening Colorado now has 380

632
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:51,190
recreational pot dispensaries and 480

633
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:53,259
licensed recreational pot growers up

634
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,288
from a few dozen in the state's first

635
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:58,720
month of retail recreational pot any

636
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,730
guys those 480 recreational growers are

637
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,700
actually commercial growers that only

638
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,839
vend two dispensaries recreational

639
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,120
dispensaries that does not include

640
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,668
private grows so there are a lot more

641
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,439
private grows that are not counted so

642
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,929
you guys we made so much tax money that

643
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,460
we have to give our state a tax break

644
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,830
all the customers that come to buy

645
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,980
cannabis on September 16th will not have

646
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:22,418
to pay the regular cannabis tax so it's

647
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,950
gonna be awesome so if you come from out

648
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:26,259
of state we hope to see you at the spot

649
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,278

650
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,819

653
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,240

654
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:34,950

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,230
additional recalls are possible

744
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,700
inspectors visited Mahatma's facilities

745
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,440
and pored through records and products

00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,779
inspectors to visit his facility on

750
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,759
Wednesday pesticides typically are

751
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,470
applied while a plant is growing not

752
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,450
after it has been harvested dried and

753
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,579
sold the post investigation found

754
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,019
mahatma had inadvertently mislabeled its

755
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,000
products to indicate the concentrate

756
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,619
came from plants it had grown the

757
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,140
pesticides were not included in the

758
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,849
products labels list of ingredients

759
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,070
state law requires labels to reflect any

760
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:09,869
pesticide or herbicide or contaminant

761
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:12,480
that was used at any stage of a

762
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:14,519
marijuana products processing though the

763
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,200
law also requires cannabis businesses to

764
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,440
test for pesticides that provision has

765
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,690
not yet been enforced Mouser previously

766
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,370
said the businesses labels are only as

767
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,470
accurate as the information provided to

768
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,299
them we were going by what our clients

769
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,950
give us as far as an ingredient list he

770
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,859
told the post we go over the ingredients

771
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,509
list and we checked that list again

772
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,279
against the approved pesticides list if

773
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,129
we find something that isn't on the list

774
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,809
we notified the processing client the

775
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,790
pesticides found in the post test are

776
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:44,970
among hundreds of Colorado Department of

777
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:46,409
Agriculture has not approved for use on

778
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,940
marijuana because product labels

779
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,550
restrict they're used to certain plant

780
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,500
and crops or to specific locations such

781
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,599
as open fields and residential Gardens

782
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,859
because marijuana is illegal under

783
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,079
federal law the US Environmental

784
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,878

pesticide for use on cannabis

786
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:04,138
nor allow any testing as a result there

787
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,359
are no safety limits established for

788
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:08,878
their use specific to cannabis or their

789
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:11,128
ingestion by consumers however the

790
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:13,019
products are allowed on other consumable

791
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,308
items such as strawberries tomatoes and

792
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,878
grapes though the level of pesticide

793
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:19,828
residues allowed on each does vary the

794
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:22,078
post found pesticides levels edge mas as

795
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:24,239
much as six times the highest amount

796
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:26,908
allowed on an edible food product and as

797
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:28,469
high as 1,800 times the level Denver

798
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:30,539
officials allowed to be on release

799
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:32,519
plants at hand core it had quarantined

800
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:36,719
earlier this year over pesticide

801
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:39,179
concerns this plant had 1,800 times the

802
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:41,879
level that Denver allowed to be released

803
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,589
this plant had been sprayed to [ __ ]

804
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:44,788
whatever they were whatever material

805
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:46,979
they use these guys were spraying the

806
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:49,048
[ __ ] out of it all the time and way too

807
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:50,068
concentrated this is crazy I don't know

808
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:51,509
what kind of bugs they were trying to

809
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,368
treat for but they are not quality

810
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,139
farmers I'll go on with the article it

811
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:56,908
says enforcement of the state's list of

812
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:58,468
allowable pesticides is sporadic at best

813
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,059
with most city and state officials

814
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:02,639
responding to complaints rather than

815
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,898
inspecting each facility Colorado had

816
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:05,939
about five years of medical marijuana

817
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:09,478
cultivation and sales before the state

818
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,129
in 2013 began compiling a list of which

819
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,019
pesticides could be used on the plants

820
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:15,538
officials admit that reflects an

821
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:18,028
imperfect system Colorado's marijuana

822
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,940
Tsar Andrew Friedman said the state is

823
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:22,499
dealing with the problem as best it can

824
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,869
many growers are new to regulated

825
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:26,729
pesticide use beyond that like banking

826
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:28,978
the pesticide regulatory system is

827
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,989
heavily built on federal involvement Sen

hickenlooper office of marijuana

830
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,479
coordination I know that's not a

831
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:38,249
completely satisfying answer and

832
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,749
honestly I wish we had these challenges

833
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,449
solved by day one but we're working

834
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:44,368
toward an enforceable solution that also

835
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:47,489
protects consumers from other

836
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:49,108
contaminants such as mold so you guys

837
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:50,879
they are trying to keep the cannabis

838
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:53,038
safe they're testing it now to find out

839
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,658
what is in it they are figuring out what

840
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,249
pesticides we should and should not be

841
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,559
using they are setting levels they are

842
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,389
trying to keep the consumer safe we have

843
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,098
taken this out of the basement we've put

844
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:04,078
it into the store and now we're putting

845
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:07,048
it into laboratories I hope this shows

846
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:09,868
the Colorado is doing our best to make a

847
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:12,148
legitimate business out of cannabis this

848
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:13,230
isn't just weed anymore this is a

849
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,209
product this is a

850
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,400
commercial product that's being tested I

851
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,019
am impressed but at the same time I'm

852
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,990
bummed out that there are well-known

853
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,490
companies like Mahatma that are still

854
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,230
screwing it up and miss labeling and

855
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,150
making mistakes like this Mahama has one

856
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,529
cannabis cups I have done business with

857
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,000
Mahatma and they've always been super

858
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:31,678
kind to me so it's a little

859
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,380
disappointing to see an industry leader

860
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,429
come out and make a mistake like this

861
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,570
they will get it together they'll get

862
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,160
their [ __ ] together and like they said

863
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:40,500
they were only going by the labels that

864
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,509
they were given by the growers so that

865
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,589
was probably not their fault I want to

866
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:44,039
go ahead and give them the benefit of

867
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,199
the doubt

868
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,589
Mahatma didn't do this on purpose they

869
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,480
were just going off of labels so this

870
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:55,349
next article is completely related to

871
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,329
this a lot of this testing and pesticide

872
00:28:55,349 --> 00:29:00,240
testing and safety inspections have all

873
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:01,980
stemmed from a few small incidents but

874
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,230
it has sparked a lot of investigation

875
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,079
and it is going to improve our industry

876
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,669
in my opinion so I'm going to read

877
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,949
another article that came out the day

878
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,929
after the last article this one says

879
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,880
colorado state AG officials watch probes

880
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:16,740
on pesticides Colorado Department of

881
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,990
Agriculture has investigations underway

882
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,819
on pesticide misuse by Denver marijuana

883
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,859
businesses mahatma concentrates and

884
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,569
treatments unlimited so this is pretty

885
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,339
much a follow-up of the last article I

886
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:29,519
read this is again by David McGowan and

887
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,298
Ricardo Baca and the article goes like

888
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,819
this

889
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,619
Colorado agriculture officials have have

890
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,450
opened an investigation into a marijuana

891
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,369
grow operation named in a report by the

892
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,440
Denver Post about pesticide residues

893
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,939
residues and they confirmed a second

894
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,460
business named in the story was already

895
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,140
under scrutiny it is unclear which of

896
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,058
the two companies Mahatma concentrates

897
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,220
or treatments unlimited both in Denver

898
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:51,359
was already under scrutiny and officials

899
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,970
with the Colorado Department of

900
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,829
Agriculture would not elaborate but the

901
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,569
agency said investigations into other

902
00:29:55,829 --> 00:30:01,109
businesses used of pesticides is the

903
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:02,849
focus of its probe the CDA has one

904
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:04,439
ongoing investigation with one of the

905
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:06,689
growers and based on the information

906
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,490
supplied in the article we have opened a

907
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,080
second investigation into the other

908
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,058
named grower to determine if their

909
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,339
pesticide use is in compliance with the

910
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,529
Colorado pesticide applicators CDA

911
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,839
spokeswoman Kristy Lightcap said in an

912
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,519
email penalties on the growers could

913
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,558
range from a simple order to stop the

914
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,079
prohibited conduct to fines up to one

915
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,668
thousand dollars for each violation

916
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,178
under the Act repeat offenders fines are

917
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:28,649
double

918
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,538
and chronic offenders face potential

919
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:32,908
license sanctions like cap said although

920
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,888
laws require marijuana businesses to

921
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:37,320
test for pesticide residues that rule

922
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:38,788
has not only has not been enforced

923
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,428
because only one facility is certified

924
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:42,778
to do that analysis Colorado marijuana

925
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:44,219
enforcement division rules show

926
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,598
marijuana that tests positive for

927
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:47,629
unapproved pesticides and other

928
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:49,648
contaminants must be destroyed or

929
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:52,048
decontaminated you guys I don't know how

930
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:54,148
to decontaminate cannabis you can't

931
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:56,069
really wash it off so I think your

932
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:57,898
option is to destroy it the post on

933
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,460
Tuesday reported that two of eight lab

934
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,168
tested commission on marijuana act

935
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,210

936
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:05,369
pesticides and products made by Mahatma

937
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,719
although Mahatma labels indicated the

938
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,668
tainted marijuana used to make these

939
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:10,679

947
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:25,440
eleven marijuana growers to have about

948
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:27,088
1,000 per a hundred thousand plants

949

quarantined earlier this year by Denver

950
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:31,469
health officials over pesticide concerns

951
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:33,928
the city allowed most of the plants back

952
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:35,548
into commerce including those grown by

953
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:37,019
treatments when levels of pesticide

954
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:39,148
residues dropped to the lowest amount

955
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,710
allowed on food crops to other

956
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:43,258
businesses destroyed the plants rather

957
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,788
than wait for pesticide test results see

958
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,288
DA's announcement on Wednesday came a

959
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:47,669
day after the Denver Department of

960
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:49,469
Environmental Health issued a broad

961
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,259
recall of them of Mahatma products

962
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:53,190
following a visit to that shop

963
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,479

965
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,619
Wednesday retailers with recalled

966
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:00,450
products were instructed to remove them

967
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:02,128
from store shelves and either destroy

968
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,929
the products in compliance with any D

969
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,699
regulations or return the products to

970
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,798
the manufacturer said Dan Rowland

971
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,169
spokesman for the Denver's Office of

972
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,088
Marijuana Policy consumers should either

973
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,859
destroy any recalled product they have

974
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:15,719
or return it to the store of purchase

975
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:17,668
Roland said this information of

976
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:19,288
potential pesticide misuse is concerning

977
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:22,619
Lightcap said in an announcing

978
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:24,058
investigation the CDA has identified a

979
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,978
list of products that can be used on

980
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,288
marijuana and had it has been available

981
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:30,058
to growers for well over one year

982
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:31,950
pesticides on marijuana is a

983
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:35,038
controversial topic because no science

984
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,860
no science exists to say which products

985
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,690
are safe for consumers

986
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,579
although several pesticides are approved

987
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,929
for use on some fruit and vegetable

00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:45,860
Agency cannot say whether they are safe

990
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,009
on marijuana because the plant is

991
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:51,048
illegal under federal law CDA has

992
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,089
complied compiled a list of pesticides

993
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:55,339
some of them so non-toxic that they do

994
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,079
not require federal registration that

995
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,849
can be used on marijuana based on their

996
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,339
label restrictions not on their safety

997
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:03,379
it is a violation of federal law to use

998
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:06,048
any pesticide contrary to its label

999
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,640
directions CDA has chosen those products

1000
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,470
whose label restrictions were so broad

1001
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,259
that using them on marijuana would not

1002
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,880
be in violation but CDA officials have

1003
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,190
constantly said they do not recommend

1004
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,780
using pesticides on marijuana nor will

1005
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,700
they say those products that appear on

1006
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:22,039
its list of approved pesticides are

1007
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,960
safety consumers we are in a completely

1008
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,178
new business here and we're building a

1009
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,558
space shuttle that is not done that has

1010
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,660
not been done anywhere else

1011
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,789
Colorado agricultural Commissioner Don

1012
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,410
Brown said other states including New

1013
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:35,539
Hampshire have restricted pesticides

1014
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,580
allowed on marijuana only to those so

1015
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:38,599
non-toxic that federal registration is

1016
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:40,548
not required

1017
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,019
Colorado nearly did the same but the

1018
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:44,869
industry argued that non-toxic

1019
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:47,058
pesticides mainly organics such as neem

1020
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:48,168
cinnamon and peppermint oils weren't

1021
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,359
nearly strong enough to combat

1022
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:54,140
effectively the pests and mildews that

1023
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:56,359
most commonly attack their crop you know

1024
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,790
I'm I'm kind of torn by pesticides

1025
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,819
because I run a commercial grow and we

1026
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:05,269
cannot lose a million-dollar harvest to

1027
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:07,399
bugs so we have to do something to keep

1028
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:09,769
bugs off of it I agree with this last

1029
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,570
statement here that organics such as

1030
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,059
neem oil cinnamon and peppermint oils

1031
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,280
and rosemary oil is something and cedar

1032
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:18,980
oil is also something commonly is those

1033
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,490
oils are great as a preventative those

1034
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,898
are wonderful on a small scale grow

1035
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:26,809
unfortunately those types of oils will

1036
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:28,009
end up in your concentrate just like all

1037
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:32,148
of these pesticides

1038
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,560
I can taste neem oil in your dabs if you

1039
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:35,418
spray neem oil on your plants early

1040
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,668
before a flower or just before a flower

1041
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,730
or early into flower I can taste the

1042
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:42,469
neem oil in your extracts recently I had

1043
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,940
some dabs given to me by an artist he

1044
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,949
wanted me to sample them and I could

1045
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,168
taste the rosemary oil in his

1046
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,210
concentrate so using essential oils

1047
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,269
isn't always the cure the end

1048
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,679
the preventative the answer also

1049
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:56,210
sometimes you have to use some type of a

1050
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,000
pesticide especially when you're getting

1051
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,920
clones from other people that's where I

1052
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,929
find I get the bugs the most often is

1053
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,269
when I get a clone as a gift from

1054
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:06,829
another grower it almost always has some

1055
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,259
kind of a bug on it so when you get a

1056
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:11,299
new clone that's when I treat with I use

1057
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,130
heavy [ __ ] depending on what the clone

1058
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,780
is and what bugs I see on it but I will

1059
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,240
use some pretty radical treatment

1060
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,160
because I cannot risk my mother plants

1061
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,379
giving spider mites I cannot risk my

1062
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,019
mother plants getting broad mites I'm a

1063
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,269
breeder I rely on my mother plants that

1064
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,070
is my future that is my work I've spent

1065
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:30,440
years developing those mother plants if

1066
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,599
bugs destroyed those oh I would be

1067
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,720
devastated so I do understand the need

1068
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,300
for a little bit of a stronger pesticide

1069
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,519
in a commercial environment something

1070
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,380
that I have recently started doing I am

1071
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:47,869
studying for a Department of Agriculture

1072
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,970
pesticide applicators test um

1073
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,490
I think anybody that is spraying

1074
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:54,559
pesticides and any type of a garden

1075
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:56,149
should have to at least examine this

1076
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,679
test you don't have to pass it I work in

1077
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,780
a commercial facility I will be training

1078
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,639
new employees on pesticide safety I'm

1079
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,140
required to take this test I would

1080
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,989
encourage anybody who's going to play

1081
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:08,509
with pesticides to take this test it

1082
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:10,159
will teach you a lot about pesticide

1083
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,810
safety to start with how to handle a

1084
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,699
pesticide how to apply a pesticide

1085
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,739
safely what to wear when you're doing it

1086
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:18,939
but it will also teach you what is in

1087
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:21,108
almost everything there are very few

1088
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,700
chemicals that they're using and all

1089
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:24,319
these brands they're just different

1090
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,118
brands with different labels it's the

1091
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,980
same chemical in almost everything and

1092
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,140
if you learn what chemicals kill which

1093
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,030
bugs it makes your job a lot easier

1094
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:33,889
so I recommend studying up on this

1095
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,170
pesticide test go to your States a great

1096
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:37,608
Department of Agriculture website and

1097
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,320
see if there is an applicator test

1098
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,029
anybody who does a job like an

1099
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,769
exterminator or something like that has

1100
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:45,109
to pass this test so it's available in

1101
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,969
your area it'll help you combat your

1102
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:49,369
pest problems a lot better and it will

1103
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:51,259
also keep you safe just something I

1104
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,400
recommend it's something I'm doing so do

1105
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,130
it with me it'll be fun we can do it

1106
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,588
together all right so my point with

1107
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,450
these articles is that we are not

1108
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:01,338
screwing around here in Colorado we are

1109
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:03,409
actually testing products to make sure

1110
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,980
that things are safe we have stepped up

1111
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,629
our game

1112
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,579
we're gonna separate I'm going to see a

1113
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,230
lot of businesses fall apart because of

1114
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,809
all this new regulation with pesticide

1115
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,909
testing a lot of the growers that think

1116
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:16,219
they are master growers and pro growers

1117
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,509
are not going to know what to do once

1118
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:19,399
they start getting rid of some of the

1119
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,050
pesticides we're gonna have to start

1120
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,410
using an integrated pest management

1121
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,330
system with live insects it's gonna be a

1122
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,379
whole different ballgame pretty soon I'm

1123
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,139
gonna write that down because that

1124
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,369
sounds like a good episode I excuse me

1125
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:33,199
it sounds like a good episode idea we

1126
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,460
could talk about integrated god--not and

1127
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,929
burpin we could talk about integrated

1128
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,300
pest management on a whole nother

1129
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:41,779
episode so I'm writing a note of that

1130
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,070
IPM IPM there we go we'll try to get

1131
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Shawn over to talk about organic

1132
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,609
integrated pest management that'll be

1133
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,930
great all right guys let's see how long

1134
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:49,670
I've been talking I feel like I've been

1135
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:51,589
going for at least 35 minutes let's see

1136
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,480
37 minutes I think that's a long podcast

1137
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,710
you guys like to listen to about 36

1138
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,750
minutes worth of show before you get

1139
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,460
bored so it is time for me to wrap up

1140
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,019

1141
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,858
for joining me I really appreciate you

1142
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:03,019
guys listening to me

especially today I've got a little bit

1144
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:06,139
of a stuffy nose so I'm sure my voice is

1145
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,629
a little bit nasally so I do appreciate

1146
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:09,799
you for sticking through this episode

1147
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,300
thanks for listening to all the news I

1148
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,280
will be back on Monday with another

1149
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,440
episode for you I'm putting together the

1163
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,500
would be really cool the more people to

1164
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,570
give the show a rating and a good review

1165

growing better cannabis the more people

1168
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,680
that are growing better cannabis which

1169
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,210
means the more quality cannabis is

1170
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:52,009
available which means weed will get

1171
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,358
cheaper and it's just a good thing

1172
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,220

1173
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,049
