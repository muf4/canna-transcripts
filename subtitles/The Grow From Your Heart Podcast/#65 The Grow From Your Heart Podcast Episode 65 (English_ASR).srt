67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,800
they sent me a personal message and I'm

68
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,540
gonna read it out loud it says Rasta

69
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,219
Jeff big fan of the podcast I recently

70
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,620
finished a binge listening to the whole

71
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,269
back catalogue and enjoyed every episode

72
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,650
I'm somewhat disappointed I now have to

73
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,900
go days between episodes

74
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,549
but I'm sure I'll cope I've learned a

75
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,840
lot from the grow lessons with you Jesse

76
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,610
and Spence it's nice to have a

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
lighthouse in the sea of [ __ ] that

78
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,390
is the internet forums and I'm glad you

79
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,669
pointed that out because that's part of

80
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:57,619
what inspired me to want to do I wanted

81
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,909
to write a book originally but uh I'm

82
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,789
too scatterbrained to write a damn book

83
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:03,829
so we did a podcast and part of my goal

84
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:05,090
was to dispel a bunch of the [ __ ]

85
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,040
that we see on the internet and in the

86
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,450
forums so I'm glad you realize that

87
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,739
that's what we're out and trying to do

88
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm glad you appreciate it

89
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,640
so then he goes on to say I was halfway

90
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,930
through vegging a half dozen plants in

91
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,869
Bubble buckets when I started listening

92
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,280
to the G fyh needless to say I have seen

93
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,170
the light and I'm gearing up to switch

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,729
to soil for the next run and I have

95
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,608
planned with hopes of soon becoming

96
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,439
fully organic dude don't worry about

97
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,879
jumping in fully organic just do what

98
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,370
you can to get rid of those buckets and

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,229
start learning how to work so I'll read

100
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,670
a few books read the TLO book like Shawn

101
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:36,199
and I were talking about that'll

102
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,639
definitely get you started read teeming

103
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,339
with microbes that'll get you a good

104
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,018
start don't go to don't try to be too

105
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,909
hardcore about going fully organic right

106
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,129
away learn how to grow and adjust slowly

107
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,568
and we just want you to get there when

108
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,068
you're ready then he goes on to say I

109
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:51,409
would like to gain some more insight and

110
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:52,849
perspective from you on indoor soil

111
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,169
setups you've mentioned you hand water

112
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,789
plants most of the time does this

113
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,189
consist of literally pouring the water

114
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,439
to each plant or some other system I am

115
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,370
misunderstanding and then he goes on it

116
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,959
says thank you for your time and effort

117
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,969
looking forward to getting my hands on

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,670
some IRA genetics as soon as they hit

119
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,340
NGR um let me go with that first

120
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:13,669
paragraph they're hand watering yes I

121
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,069
mix my so I run my personal caregiver

122
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,918
grows our soil grows so I will mix my

123
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:20,298
nutrients into a large container

124
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,069
honestly my big batches are mixed up in

125
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,629
a Rubbermaid trash can that's how much I

126
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,848
mix them I've got a mark where it's 25

127
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:27,829
gallons I mix up a twenty five gallon

128
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,269
batch I'll adjust the PA

129
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:30,769
if I'm using organics you can't [ __ ]

130
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,079
with the pH too much you have to accept

131
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:35,240
what it is if you're using synthetic

132
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,878
nutrients go ahead and fix your pH I use

133
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,129
a 1 gallon pitcher just like you'd get

134
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,408
at Target or wherever else you're

135
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,300
shopping I like Target just stick the

136
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:46,610
picture right in there and pour it right

137
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,199
into the plant that way I have a good

138
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,658
gauge of how much I'm putting into each

139
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,550
plant I can say this plant prefers 1/2 a

140
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:54,259
gallon this plant prefers a whole gallon

141
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,879
can kind of measure that way so yeah I'm

142
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,889
actually hand watering just by using a

143
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,169
pitcher and dumping it into the plant I

144
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,019
run seven gallon pots or my favorites to

145
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:04,370
use and each 7 gallon pot takes a gallon

146
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,079
of water it's a perfect mathematical

147
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,959
equation to know how many gallons you

148
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,728
need know it's easy for me so never a

149
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,128
stupid question that was a great

150
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,418
question glad you asked also dude thanks

151
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,639

00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,379
prevent the V what's it called the

156
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,718
withdrawals by doing episodes more often

157
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,550
but I don't want to burn you out I save

158
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,079
material so that I have something worth

159
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,360
of [ __ ] so that I don't just show up and

160
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,889
give you a crappy show but if I've got

161
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,120

174
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,819
that I got the honor to go see one of my

175
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,560
favorite reggae bands in the whole world

176
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,110
I got to go see Morgan heritage at

177
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,769
servantes other side in Denver Colorado

178
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,908
I drove the 2 hour drive by myself a lot

179
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,740
of people are like dude you drive up

180
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:14,598
there by yourself and not a big deal I

181
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,658
listen to a podcast take a couple dabs

182
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,709
before I leave and it's a great trip and

183
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:20,060
then when you get there you get to a

184
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,680
reggae show and I'm a white guy with

185
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,629
dreadlocks to my butt and a lot of the

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,370
reggae scene knows me I was there for 10

187
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:26,509
minutes by myself before I made friends

188
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,819
and bumped into people that I already

189
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,150
knew so it was not even going by myself

190
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,088
really

191
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:33,468
so Morgan heritage came out dude that

192
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:35,689
been tore it up

193
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,918
Morgan heritage is on fire right now if

194
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,110
you're into reggae if you like good

195
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,299
harmonies if you want to see a killer

196
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,560

197
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,270
I recommend you go check out Morgan

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,829

199
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:47,709
setlist right now is great it's a great

200
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:49,969
mix from all their albums they did

201
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,918
pretty much if I made a Morgan heritage

202
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,919
playlist they would have played it last

203
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,149
night it was perfect so a big shout out

204
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:57,889
to Morgan heritage big shout out to

205
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,019
servantes other side also big shout out

206
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,220
to Carlos and his crews get hanging out

207
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,459
with you guys made me feel like I was at

208
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:07,069
home so here's where my night got really

209
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,658
interesting I walked out of excuse me I

210
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:12,590
walked out of the venue from seeing the

211
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:14,000
concert and the band was kind of

212
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,168
gathering up by their tour bus across

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,399
the street and I couldn't see them

214
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,568
because the tour bus is long and they're

215
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,848
on the other side so I walked to the

216
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:23,120
corner where I could just casually lean

217
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:25,009
against a parking meter and stare into

218
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,509
the Denver skyline and kind of see the

219
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,250
band hanging out by their tour bus doing

220
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,598
their thing I didn't want to bug them

221
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,860
but I kind of just wanted to observe and

222
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,329
it was a nice night it was cold but it

223
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,520
was nice after being in the concert it

224
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:37,128
was nice to get some fresh air so I'm

225
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,049
standing in the corner and the light

226
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,780
turns red and a car stops in front of me

227
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,848
car stops in the Far Lane and then a car

228
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,698
stops behind that car and rolls down the

229
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:49,968
window and the guy in the driver's seat

230
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,379
yells hey [ __ ] you dreadlocks and I'm

231
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:54,800
just standing on the corner in downtown

232
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:57,110
Denver by myself at five points like

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
2:00 in the morning and I think to

234
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,468
myself this is about to get sketchy as

235
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,848
[ __ ] so I reached in my pockets to see

236
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,500
what I've got I've got a little bit of

237
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,870
weed I got a little bit of dabs in my

238
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,918
pocket I got my cell phone I got my keys

239
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,408
I don't really have anything that's

240
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,120
gonna help me out in this position I had

241
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,288
money in my pocket and I had my weed

242
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,610
pretty much all they were gonna do is

243
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,500
kick my ass and take my weed and money

244
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,819
is what I was assuming so I tried to

245
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,740
ignore them I don't know why I thought

246
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,259
being an ostrich would help just ignore

247
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,400
him and they'll go away right but uh the

248
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,319
dude rolled down his window a little

249
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,878
further and he yelled another derogatory

250
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,439
term about white guys with dreadlocks I

251
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,079
can't remember exactly it didn't that

252
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,639
wasn't what I was worried about but I

253
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,958
could look into the car and see that it

254
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,819
was fool there were at least four or

255
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,338
five maybe six people in that car and

256
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,829
they were talking mad [ __ ] to me so the

257
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,390
dude said [ __ ] you Rasta hardly Selassie

258
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,129
I is what he said to me and that was

259
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:48,078
when I was like this guy knows what I'm

260
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,480
about he knows I'm a Rasta man and he's

261
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:52,759
got hatred specifically for Rastafarians

262
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,710
especially white Rastas and that's what

263
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,509
I am and I'm all by myself

264
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,490
so look down that block to the right and

265
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,528
the concert venue was a good half a

266
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,210
block away I look down to the left and

267
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:03,500
there's nothing but [ __ ] darkness and

268
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,990
I look forward and there's a coffee shop

269
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,539
that's closed this [ __ ] it's me

270
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,250
and this carload of people and they

271
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,649
pulled up to the curb

272
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,389
and rolled down their window and it was

273
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,940
[ __ ] Chris Costas from the source

274

299

304
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,519
we walk down the street and I can't

305
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,560
disclose the location of this place but

306
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,179
we walked down the street half a block

307
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,739
and there was a brown door that just

308
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:24,079
looked like a normal door there was no

309
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,110
there was not an identifying marker on

310
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,200
the building on the door on anything

311
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,289
one of my friends knocks on the door a

312
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,570
man opens some blinds and sees us opens

313
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:37,610
the door lets us into a small waiting

314
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,720
area I didn't say anything sighted I

315
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,950
wasn't quite sure what was going on I

316
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,810
was just a new guy there just tagging

317
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,879
along they invited me ah dude hands the

318
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,129
guy at the door fifty bucks the guy

319
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,828
shakes his hand and says all of them and

320
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,539
so another guy comes and leads us to a

321
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:54,739
little further down the way and gives us

322
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:57,349
a little seating area and we all sit

323
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,370
down and I'm not sure what's going on

324
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,379
really I was told that we're going to

325
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,240
this little speakeasy but it was 2:00 in

326
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,578
the morning and they were serving drinks

327
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,230
in this joint and we sat down and I

328
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:07,519
rolled I had some flowers on me from the

329
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,920
concert that I had just been to

330
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,569
rolled a nice-sized joint Casas rolled a

331
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,370
nice-sized joint and my buddy jibs

332
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,500
started taking dabs of solvent lists

333
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,080
like it was nothing my buddy Mike was to

334
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,490
the right I mean he started taking dabs

335
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,840
dad start going around the joints are

336
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,480
going around and nobody seemed to care

337
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,060
we were the only ones puffing him there

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,090
Casas pointed out that that may have

339
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,889
been a gay bar I'm not quite sure I'm

340
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,660
sure that there were some gay folk in

341
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:35,059
there I'm not sure what qualifies it as

342
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,769
a gay bar but it had definitely a

343
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,909
different vibe but you know what I had a

344
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,319
[ __ ] ton of fun dude there was a pool

345
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,579
table in there I don't shoot pool but

346
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,600
people were shooting pool having fun

347
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,550
they were serving drinks

348
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,310
I stayed there until 4:20 in the morning

349
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,740
I was a great time I never would have

350
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:50,479

snowing dude what the hell it was windy

375
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,639
it was pushing my car sideways down i-25

376
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,179
is ridiculous so I got home about 6:00

377
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,199
in the morning

378
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:49,579
a little after 6:00 took a few dabs

379
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,110
slept did I slept most of today and then

380
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,930
I woke up got a little bit more prepared

381
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,149
for the cannabis cup and then I drove up

382
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:59,000
to Colorado Springs to see my buddy

383
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,199
hydro I've played hydro songs on the

384
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,049
show before he does the secret cup

385
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,030
anthem I saw hydro I saw a pacifier and

386
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,819
that's funny now that I say it like

387
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,079
pacifier its pacifier but I said

388
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,370
pacifier like a baby

389
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,290
[ __ ] pacifier that's funny when you

390

391
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,000

396
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,640

397
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,740
down stage at the black sheep and we

398

just start dabbing right and I'm dabbing

399
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,830

400
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,809

419
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,170
about my cannabis cup weekend on the

420
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,970
next episode that's enough of me

421
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,829
rambling let's talk about some news

422
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,210
articles where do you guys want to start

423
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,590
you want to start on the serious [ __ ]

424
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,509
actually last week I told you we were

425
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,830
gonna talk about this edibles report and

426
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,529
I skipped it because it was way too long

427
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,420
so let's get into that this article is

428
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,419
from the cannabis and it's by Ricardo

429
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:28,579
Baca the headline says special report 15

430
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:30,019
months in edibles still a safety concern

431
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,490
for Colorado I'm gonna take the quick

432
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:37,429
drink of some root beer here and then

433
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:39,980
we'll read the article alright that's a

434
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:41,509
delicious it says a year of debate a

435
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,190
slew of labeling regulations and

436
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:44,629
multiple educational campaigns have not

437
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,100
been effective in answering a critical

438
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:48,200
question surrounding marijuana infused

439
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,950
edible products how do you stop a

440
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,300
consumer from eating too much and I like

441
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,750
the way this is written it's all like

442
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:58,609
super impactive edibles once oh it's not

443
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,110
to be the simple entry for those who

444
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,730
wanted to try the newly legalized

445
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,590
recreational drug have been implicated

446
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,440
in two suicides and one murder in the

447
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,940
past 13 months only one edibles related

448
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,920
death has been confirmed by officials

449
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,960
but the family of 22 year old Oklahoma

450
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,479
tourist Luke Goodman who fatally shot

451
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,460
himself while on a March ski vacation in

452
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,740
Keystone immediately blamed his death on

453
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,499
the infused edibles he over indulged in

454
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,808
that day

455
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:24,369
it was a hundred percent the drugs Kim

456
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:26,198
Goldman said at the time acknowledging

457
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:27,969
that her son didn't read the government

458
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:29,948
mandated warnings on the packaging and

459
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:32,219
ended up eating five times the state's

460
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:34,358
recommended dose for edible cannabis

461
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:35,079
what's the recommended does is it twenty

462
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,339
five I think

463
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,698
so that means he ate a hundred and

464
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,199
twenty five milligrams um I had 100

465
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:43,448
milligram Claudie Baird the other night

466
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,238
and I was high so if this dude doesn't

467
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:48,308
do any cannabis consumption until this

468
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:49,899
point and he eats 100 milligrams he was

469
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:52,418
probably pretty [ __ ] high to tell you

470
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,158
the truth so then it goes on to say much

471
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,568
of the regulatory debate around edibles

472
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:57,278
has focused on preventing accidental

473
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:59,108
ingestion but the manner in which

474
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,729
edibles affected person raises the

475
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:02,288
question whether more should be done to

476
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:04,299
educate buyers before they leave the

477
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:05,979
shop there's a learning curve for

478
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,239
consumers of edibles that aren't way

479
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:09,999
Colorado State Director of

480
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:11,168
pro-legalization drug policy Alliance we

481
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,538
cannot escape the issue of personal

482
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:15,788
responsibility that said the industry

483
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:17,019
should do all that is reasonable in the

484
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:19,359
formative years of marijuana

485
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,658
legalization to combat concerns around

486
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:24,908
edibles nearly 5 million edibles were

487
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:27,788
sold in Colorado shops in 2014

488
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:29,048
not only are edibles high okay I'm going

489
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,489
to try that sense again not only are

490
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:31,869
edibles high is more delayed and

491
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,119
long-lasting than smoking or vaporizing

492
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:35,678
cannabis but some brands continue to

493
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,709
severely mismeasure their products

494
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:39,788
potency according to a new Denver Post

495
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:42,818
commissioned series of lab tests

496
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:44,408
measuring THC s and 10 popular edibles

497
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:46,389
any guys you'll remember we did a report

498
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:48,869
on that way in the infancy of this show

499
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:51,609
a bunch of the companies were making

500
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:53,259
edibles a random person bought them and

501
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:54,339
took them to steep hill labs and things

502
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,709
that were claiming to have a hundred

503
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,859
milligrams we're having 10 and then also

504
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,448
maybe 200 so it was way off the chart so

505
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:03,369
it's hard to even say what some of these

506
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:05,798
people ate when they got all [ __ ] up

507
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:09,038
and did stupid stuff where was I in the

508
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,720
article here it is earlier this year it

509
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,000
seemed as if the state's legislative pot

510
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,399
docket had calmed down after a busting

511
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,740
bustling 2014 of regulations and

512
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:19,208
rulemaking four edibles alone warning

513
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,949
labels already had been standardized

514
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,399
with more information ten milligram

515
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,558
doses of THC universally universally had

516
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,208
become individually wrapped the state

517
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,250
was working on uniform lab testing

518
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,139
standards and users encountered

519
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,700
educational campaigns at every turn

520
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:36,789
movie theaters posh

521
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,950
and interstate billboards you know I I

522
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,329
think that when you're buying edibles I

523
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,830
think you should be given a pamphlet or

524
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,960
something would be a good start because

525
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:47,439
I've been to a hundred dispensaries I

526
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,950
work at a dispensary and the budtender

527
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,420
will say hey this is serious like take

528
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,569
this seriously and the people don't

529
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,560
respect it they just don't care and so I

530
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,899
think maybe if he gave him a little

531
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,220
papers that they could read it most of

532
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,160
them are gonna throw it away but at

533
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,539
least we gave them that paper and gave

534
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,890
them the opportunity to read it because

535
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,629
when people talk it's easy just to

536
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,740
ignore us when we're at the shop you're

537
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,970
looking at all the buds you're looking

538
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,990
at all the concentrates you're thinking

539
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,240
about how much money you can spend

540
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,559
you're just excited the money comes

541
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,549
flying out of your pocket you put the

542
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,230
edibles right in your mouth you don't

543
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,460
even think so I think if we give you a

544
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,079
little piece of paper to read and kind

545
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,910
of showed you some [ __ ] that might be a

546
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,289
good start maybe make you sign something

547
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,460
but then people don't even want to [ __ ]

548
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,710
around if you have to sign something at

549
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,360
the dispensary I remember the first time

550
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,029
I bought a decade dose Chiba Choo

551
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,589
it was when they first first came out my

552
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,329
friend had a shop and he invited me to

553
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,129
get a deck of DOS and they made me sign

554
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:37,960
a waiver to eat a decade dose Chiba Shu

555
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,280
I bought it and actually made me eat it

556
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,470
there because they didn't want me to

557
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,700
give it to anybody they told me to eat

558
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,470
it there ain't the whole thing in front

559
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,660
of them all right I'm gonna go on with

560
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,370
the article here it says in the wake of

561
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,990
Goldman's death many recalled 19

562
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,849
year-old Wyoming college student Levi

563
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,470
tombow who became agitated after eating

564
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:55,179
an infused cookie with more than six

565
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,150
times the state's recommended dose in

566
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,460
March 2014 and left to his death from a

567
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,230
Denver hotel balcony the Denver coroner

568
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,509
listed medical intoxication as a

569
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,670
significant condition contributing to

570
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:08,279
Tom bus' death have you ever been so

571
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,230
high you wanted to jump off the balcony

572
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,000
that's [ __ ] high as the summit county

573
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,920
coroner awaits Goodman's toxicology

574
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,569
reports in the coming weeks his death be

575
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,310
related to cannabis or nas served as a

576
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,619
reminder that the edibles conversation

577
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:22,179
is anything but over as we continue down

578
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,949
this road we really need to keep an open

579
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,390
mind said Luis Coski director of

580
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,799
Colorado medical Oh

581
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,360
Colorado's marijuana Enforcement

582
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,710
Division I'm gonna continue to say

583
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,059
medical marijuana Enforcement Division

584
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,519
on accident because that's what it

585
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:35,019
started off as they think we have to

586
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,549
consider various incidents that occur

587
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,519
and work on putting them into

588
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,649
perspective as in what things do we as

589
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,109
regulators have control over to making

590
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,060
things more efficient Koski looks to the

591
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,569
edibles workgroup that met four times

592
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,909
and to

593
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:51,639
and 14 to discuss making edibles clearly

594
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,380
identifiable improving and simplifying

595
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,030
the labels on edibles reminding

596
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,560
consumers that a single dose is 10

597
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,849
milligrams and to weight one to two

598
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,769
hours to feel the effect before

599
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,599
ingesting more was discussed by the

600
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,609
workgroup which included state officials

601
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,319
pot shop owners representatives from

602
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:09,909
edibles kitchens and children's health

603
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:12,099
advocates too much too fast the new

604
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,570
rules are due January 1st but while

605
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,339
these regulations might help curb

606
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:16,960
accidental ingestion it remains unclear

607
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,459
if they will stop individuals from

608
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,039
eating too much too fast

609
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,900
prominent Denver pot shop owner in seva

610
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,819
pointed to Goodman suicide to illustrate

611
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,830
how much tragedies can't always be

612
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:28,960
prevented by the state the industry and

613
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,669
the regulations they draft at no point

614
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,710
do I feel the retailer who sold the

615
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,590
cannabis is responsible for his death

616
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,759
said CB owner of Denver relief and chair

617
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:39,250
of the National cannabis Industry

618
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,319
Association I'm not a parent but I was

619
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,150
disappointed because I know that if I

620
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,799
have a friend or family member who's

621
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,340
rambling incoherently and not acting

622
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,919
himself

623
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:49,419
I'm not leaving that person alone so

624
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,009
you've referred to Goodman's family who

625
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,600
said he was acting erratically and he

626
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:54,730
didn't recognize our present the

627
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,559
presents almost I had never seen him

628
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,660
like this but they still chose to leave

629
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,259
him alone in the condo as they went to

630
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,570
the hot tub

631
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,250
according to reports so this dude was

632
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:06,519
freaking out on a cannabis edible you

633
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,720
guys ah and what he did was walked into

634
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,000
the room and shot himself and killed

635
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,920
himself and that's kind of what sparked

636
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,099
a lot of the re-examination of the

637
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,390
cannabis edible rules so here's what I

638
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,129
want to say if you come to Colorado and

639
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,870
you eat some edibles respect that [ __ ]

640
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,460
it is serious these aren't the brownies

641
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,019
that your sister used to make these

642
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,549
aren't the cookies that your mom used to

643
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:26,859
make back in the 70s

644
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:29,529
these are lab tested edibles made by

645
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:31,509
professionals this started being made

646
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:35,589
for medical patients that had cancer

647
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:37,089
Crohn's disease severe pain cachexia we

648
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,799
needed a way to get these people well

649
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,149
and we weren't [ __ ] around so we

650
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,799
figured out ways to make these edibles

651

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,419
this from world world news daily report

670
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,579
com

671
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,860
and the article is written by Bob

672
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,139
Flanagan and it said Monsanto creates

673
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:29,199
first genetically modified strain of

674
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,230
marijuana says st. Louis Missouri

675
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,028
Monsanto the multi-billion agribusiness

676
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,769
giant has announced today it has

677
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:39,849
patented the first genetically modified

678
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,349
strain of marijuana right now Monsanto

679
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,359
is a breeder what the hell are they

680
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:45,339
gonna be at the cup selling seeds no

681
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,819
it's not like that let me read this

682
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:50,199
article for you what says the news that

683
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,609
has been welcomed by scientists and

684
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,528
leaders of the agriculture business

685
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:55,058
alike as they move forward toward the

686
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:56,589
industrial use of marijuana and hemp

687
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:58,389
products could bring a major shift

688
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:01,058
towards marijuana policies in the USA

689
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,220
and ultimately to the world under

690
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:05,829
present under present US federal law it

691
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,558
is illegal to visit to possess use buy

692
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:10,960
sell or cultivate marijuana since the

693
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,759
Controlled Substances Act of 1970

694
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,710
classifies marijuana as a schedule 1

695
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:18,038
drug although it has been decriminalized

696
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,288
in some some to some extent in certain

697
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:22,480
states Monsanto's interest in the field

698
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:24,849
has been interpreted by experts as the

699
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,460
precursor to a major shift in Marijuana

700
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:30,278
Policy in the u.s. that is as it is

701
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,288
believed the company he would not have

702
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,390
invested so much time and energy if it

703
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:36,069
not had previous knowledge of the

704
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,259
federal government's openness toward the

705
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:40,558
future legalization of marijuana dan

706
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:43,028
that was hard to read I'm sorry you guys

707
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,619
warrior and marijuana law specialist

708
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:46,390
edmond grunt of the drug policy Alliance

709
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,278
admits Monsanto's involvement in

710
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,460
marijuana projects could definitely help

711
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,470
the pro legalization activist currently

712
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,659
federal law criminalizes marijuana and

713
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,190
hemp derivatives because public opinion

714
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,720
is still against it and legal commercial

715
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,610
production in the US is currently

716
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,220
handled by a patchwork of small farmers

717
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:04,629
who are not trusted by investors a major

718
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,639
player as Monsanto could bring

719
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,889
confidence within government and towards

720
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:10,329
investors in the market if it were to

721
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:12,398
own a large part of

722
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:16,928
the exploitable lands and commercial

723
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:18,308
products ah that is partly accurate but

724
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:19,929
I hate that alright let me keep reading

725
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:21,519
there's presently no way to control the

726
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:24,220
production of marijuana and the quality

727
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,169
of the strains a GM strain produced by a

728
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,360
company with the credentials and

729
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:30,340
prestige of Monsanto would definitely

730
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,558
lend a massive hand to pro-legalization

731
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:34,359
activists what the certain spheres of

732
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,609
government and within the business world

733
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,500
he explains I'm fired up cuz I'm a

734
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:40,240
cannabis breeder and they're talking

735
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,819
[ __ ] saying that I don't know I'm not

736
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,960
trustable but if you use Monsanto

737
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,879
because they've got credentials and

738
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,370
prestige that people are gonna trust

739
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,049
that [ __ ] it's true but that sucks

740
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,369
just cuz I've got dreadlocks and red

741
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:53,470
eyes doesn't mean I'm not trustable

742
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:55,058
incredible alright it goes on to say

743
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,399
although Monsanto's testing on cannabis

744
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:58,418
is only at an experimental stage no plan

745
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,148
has yet been released by the

746
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,830
agricultural business firm as to what

747
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:04,839
purposes the patent strain would be used

748
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:06,668
for although specialists believe answers

749
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,168
should come this fall as rumors of a

750
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,360
controversial new bill which could

751
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:12,070
loosen up laws around medical marijuana

752
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,648
is reportedly scheduled to pass before

753
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:16,480
Congress coming this fall critics fear

754
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:18,699
genetically modified cannabis will mix

755
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,389
with other strains and could destroy the

756
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,960
diversity of DNA a reality dismissed by

757
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:27,908
most studies claimed experts I've got my

758
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,659
own feelings about this because I'm a

759
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:33,760
breeder and all right so I think

760
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:35,500
Monsanto's gonna find a strain or use a

761
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,669
strain that someone they know has been

762
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,200
working with and they're gonna figure

763
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,059
out ways to manipulate the genetic

764
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,009
makeup of that plant to tweak it to be

765
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:43,538
pest and mold resistant and grow the

766
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,129
most desirable sets of traits the drawer

767
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:47,259
could want right that would be neat that

768
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,110
would be ideal so let's see them breed

769
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:51,278
like a high CBD strain that everybody

770
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,869
could grow you know what I mean wouldn't

771
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,450
that be awesome if Monsanto made a high

772
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:56,798
CBD low THC strain that you could put in

773
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,230
your front yard and grow right next to

774
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,819
your shrubs that would be awesome right

775
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,190
you could grow a worldwide be pennies a

776
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:05,138
pound right but [ __ ] no that's not

777
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,820
what Monsanto does it's what they could

778
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:09,250
do but they're the [ __ ] devil so they

779
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:10,538
don't unfortunately uh I think this is

780
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,589
what's gonna happen I thought about this

781
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:12,940
I think it's gonna lead to a

782
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,949
commercialized strain that will

783
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,149
definitely suck it's gonna be like

784
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,538
cigarettes you know what I mean back in

785
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:18,699
the day

786
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:20,200
tobacco probably smelled and taste good

787
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,660
and now it just smells like [ __ ] car

788
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,039
exhaust cuz it's half crap

789
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,769
that's what I think they're gonna do

790
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,930
with cannabis ah it'll probably be

791
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:30,269
terrible I think a big part of why

792
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,890
people choose to medicate themselves

793
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,139
with medical cannabis is because we

794
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,700
don't want GMOs and dangerous [ __ ] put

795
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,500
into our bodies as medicine we've chosen

796
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,900
to grow our own cannabis or rely on a

797
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,059
trustworthy caregiver like myself to

798
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,769
grow the medical cannabis for us so we

799
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,869
don't have to buy pills and [ __ ] from a

800
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,670
company I was only a matter of time

801
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,799
before Monsanto came into the cannabis

802
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,910
game so here's my big conclusion on all

803
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,019
this I wrote down some notes and I'm

804
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,060
just reading a little bullet points

805
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,309
right now I see Monsanto teaming up with

806
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,049
Big Pharma someone creating a medical

807
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,849
cannabis program and Monsanto having the

808
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,339
only plants in that national medical

809
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:02,849
cannabis garden that's how that [ __ ]

810
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:07,859
works

811
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:09,209
ah so they'll be they'll own the patents

812
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,369
on the seeds so nobody else can grow

813
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,480
those seeds without Monsanto permission

814
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,639
you'll have to buy the seeds from

815
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,230
Monsanto they'll also have the monopoly

816
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,030
by being the only strains that are

817
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,339
available in these medically regulated

818
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:21,809
stores so that's kind of what I think

819
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,399
they'll set up a National Medical

820
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,779
Marijuana program they'll be like oh you

821
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,850
guys want legalize weed here you go

822
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,079
nationally legalize and then they're

823
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:30,119
gonna say where's we've gonna come from

824
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,379
they'll say we'll supply it we're gonna

825
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:35,099
say who's gonna grow it they're gonna go

826
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,830
dun dun dun Monsanto and we're gonna get

827
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,750
like that Monsanto og yeah that's what

828
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:42,119
you want right that big 12 percent THC

829
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,650
plant right it's gonna be terrible

830
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,069
that's what I predict that's what I see

831
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,570
coming it's gonna get creepy you know

832
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,279
how to prevent that right you guys all

833
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:53,789
have to start growing start growing

834
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,079
cannabis grow your own it sounds

835
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,700
expensive it seems like a lot of work

836
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,139
but to grow your own cannabis to be

837
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,160
self-sufficient is not that hard

838
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,930
whatever you're paying for an ounce

839
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,070
right now if you're buying it on the

840
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,980
street if you're buying it at a

841
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:07,859
dispensary you can get better safer

842
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,329
cheaper cannabis by growing your own I

843
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,819
know where to get some seeds you go to

844
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:15,269
nature's green remedies dot-com do that

845
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:17,819
so never support any Monsanto fat

846
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:22,079
companies or their subsidiaries never

847
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:23,639
Scott's [ __ ] all that stuff that is

848
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,349
available commercially is mostly

849
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,300
Monsanto like all your gardening

850
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:29,369
products that's mostly Monsanto [ __ ]

851
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,859
Scotts Turf Builder all the Miracle Grow

852
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,419
stuff that is all Monsanto [ __ ] all of

853
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,219
the bug sprays and [ __ ] you see it all

854
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,350
the on your local hardware store

855
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,710
mostly Monsanto products try to avoid

856
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:43,349
that [ __ ] if you can also there is a

857
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,710
march on Monsanto on May 23rd across the

858
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:48,449
world Google that march on Monsanto be a

859
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,000
part of that if you want people go out

860
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,740
and march in the streets and talk about

861
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,538
how they do not want these genetically

862
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,399
modified products on the shelves in our

863
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:58,950
stores and they do not want Monsanto

864
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,268
taking over our food supply all right I

865
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,860
could rant on that for days I'll

866
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:04,409
definitely be keeping a personal eye on

867
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,819
this topic let's see I got more news I

868
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,080
want to talk about I want to check in

869
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,158
and see how long we've been recording I

870
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,128
don't wanna go too long here you guys

871
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,110
get [ __ ] ADP on me 30 minutes let's

872
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:15,569
read one more quick quick news article I

873
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:18,089
got a quickie here you guys are like

874
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:19,888
this one the DEA is not only seizing

875
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,019
less cannabis they're asking to increase

876
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:23,699
their legal growth three times for

877
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:25,740
medical research this article comes from

878
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,480
the leaf Lee and who is it written by

879
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,450
who gets credit here nobody gets credit

880
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,419
no no name on it so just the Leafly is

881
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,159
all or Leafly Leafly dot-com it says the

882
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,419
Drug Enforcement Administration is

883
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,179
seizing less cannabis year-over-year

884
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,399
according to its own records in 2009 the

885
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,620
agency confiscated Nitra and destroyed

886
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,219
ten point four million cannabis plants

887
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:50,189
whereas in 2013 the numbers fell to 4.4

888
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,558
million and last year the DEA seized 4.3

889
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,090
million the steady decline can be

890
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,190
attributed to fewer funds being made

891
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:57,898
available for enforcement partly due to

892
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,028
the economic recession and partly

893
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:01,378
because both the public and government's

894
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:04,619
stance on cannabis has softened

895
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:06,119
considerably over the years with more

896
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,609
states looking to legalize in the next

897
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,018
few years as well as less funding being

898
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:12,990
generated from local and state police

899
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:15,298
asset seizures the downward trend should

900
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,250
continue meanwhile the DEA is shifting

901
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,898
from the ones doing the confiscating for

902
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,308
the ones doing the growing the

903
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:21,928
administration is proposed to increase

904
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:24,658
the amount of cannabis it's legally

905
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,879
allowed to produce by more than 300% in

906
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,620
order to do meet to meet the demands of

907
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:31,019
researchers who are studying the

908
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,839
potential medical benefits the plant has

909
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,940
to offer if it sounds weird that the DEA

910
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,349
is simultaneously seizing cannabis grows

911
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,298
and growing their own plants for

912
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,278
research purposes well it is and I

913
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:43,918
[ __ ] agree that's not only weird

914
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,898
that's hypocritical but hopefully we'll

915
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,730
continue to see the DEA shift its focus

916
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:49,259
to regulating the legal market and

917
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,660
focusing their efforts on illegal

918
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,240
an activity that damages the positive

919
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,070
progress the industry is making besides

920
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,929
we do need more cannabis research to

921
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,579
help propel the industry forward so if

922
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:01,080
the DEA can make it happen the

923
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,058
administration is actually doing

924
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,509
something positive for the cannabis

925
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:08,069
community yeah that's true if they get

926
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,029
more money for more research hopefully

927
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,259
they do the right thing with the

928
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:11,849
research hopefully they're not trying to

929
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,279
prove that it's making people [ __ ]

930
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:15,359
or making [ __ ] people turn into

931
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,980
zombies hopefully they're actually

932
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,379
trying to research that it helps us

933
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,750
cancer it helps with seizures it helps

934
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,880
with nausea it helps with depression it

935
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,589
really helps with PTSD it pisses me off

936
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,710
that in Colorado PTSD is not a

937
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:30,089
qualifying condition to get your medical

938
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,819
marijuana recommendation that's really

939
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:35,099
frustrating to me all right that's the

940
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:37,859
last news article I want to read I'm
