138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,680

you a coupon for another free pack but I

142
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,240
should probably say that from now on

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,880
only one pack per person or some [ __ ]

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,038
like that but I never said that so you

145
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,519
get another pack bro uh and rules are

146
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:14,918
made to be broken so sneak them in if I

147
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,879
read your [ __ ] twice and I don't realize

148
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,318
it then you'll win free seeds again uh

149
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,399
thanks for being honest it goes on it

150
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,360
says my question is as follows if a

151
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,799
longer flowering time plant is

152
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,879
pollinated do those seeds also take

153
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,840
longer to reach maturity in your

154
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,639
experience take care from Matt hey Matt

155
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,079
this is a really great question the

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,439
short answer is no most of the time

157
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,879
seeds take around 6 to 8 weeks to be

158
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,240
done from the time they're pollinated

159
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,159
till the time you can Harvest them there

160
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,840
are a few things uh that can speed or

161
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,720
slow that down or speed it up or slow

162
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,599
that down but in most cases you're

163
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
looking about 6 to 8 weeks for seeds the

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,160
thing is that some of those longer

165
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,399
flowering plants will take longer to be

166
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,880
ready for pollen that is the caveat with

167
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,519
those plants not all plants want pollen

168
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,719
at the same time so a plant that takes

169
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,839
longer to finish quite often we'll want

170
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,199
that pollen later in its flowering cycle

171
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,279
so the seeds uh themselves are not going

172
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,280
to take longer to finish but it may be

173
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,478
longer before that plant is ready for

174
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,799
the pollen itself two good examples in

175
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,000
my garden that I've have used quite

176
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,840
often are the Platinum Tangi female and

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,800
the Strawberry Fields female I breed

178
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,318
with both of those the Platinum Tangi

179
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,520
makes of course the orange gasm and

180
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,919
makes sunkiss uh it's making some other

181
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,359
stuff in the near future here it also

182
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,478
made the Michelangelo on the other hand

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,080
we've got the strawberry the strawberry

184
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,478
fields which makes the strawberry

185
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,038
Starburst that makes the Raphael that

186
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,318
one also makes the red pill it makes a

187
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,680
bunch of great stuff so both of those

188
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,280
plants I use in the breeding project um

189
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,079
I've done a bunch of great things with

190
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,839
both of those but what I have learned is

191
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,680
that the Platinum Tangi plant wants

192
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,359
pollen uh so one thing where I should

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,079
start I guess the Platinum Tangi plant

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,960
finishes much sooner than the Strawberry

195
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,598
Fields plant does in a normal flower

196
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,758
room by about 7 to 10 days depending on

197
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,598
the conditions the environment the feed

198
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,319
I've seen it as much as 7 to 10 days

199
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:01,759
difference in flowering in time

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
something I've definitely noticed as

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,038
well is a 7 to 14 day difference in Peak

202
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,599
pollination times of those plants those

203
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,598
are just two plants in my room that are

204
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,079
very common that I breed with a lot now

205
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,719
imagine the variance within all the

206
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,839
plants that I work with and have worked

207
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,879
with uh what I've noticed is so your

208
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,478
question is do the seeds take longer if

209
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,680
the cultivar takes longer the answer to

210
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,758
that is no but the part I'm talking

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
about now is sometimes certain plants

212
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,080
will take much longer to be ready for

213
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,000
the pollen most plants it's about like

214
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,000
day 23 to 32 you got about a 10-day real

215
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,959
Prime window but with some of them the

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,038
longer finishing plants it could be day

217
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,038
27 to day 37 I guess would be that nice

218
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,120
10day window some of them actually they

219
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,318
give you like a 3 week flowering window

220
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,959
where you can pollinate them and the

221
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,199
pistols are super ripe if it's a longer

222
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,598
flowering phenotype or a cultivar so uh

223
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,199
the question was do the seeds take

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,598
longer no but sometimes it takes longer

225
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,598
for the female plant to be ready to

226
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,000
accept that pollen now my friend Matt

227
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:59,560
that is a really great question I do

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
appreciate that it looks like I have got

229

250
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,440
glitches in my Matrix the question goes

251
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,959
a lot like this it says hello roster

252
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,240
Jeff hello Q good to meet you dude it

253
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,679
says my question is more related to iy

254
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,240
genetics website than my grow at the

255
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,199
moment you know I've been expecting this

256
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,959
question I've been waiting for this I am

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,879
prepared let's talk about this right now

258
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,759
it says I was looking on the iy website

259
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,799
for the descriptions histories and

260
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,240
lineages of the seeds and I have found

261
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,599
that those are no longer there was this

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,879
something that had to change to keep iir

263
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
online um kind of yes honestly I'm doing

264
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,519
a more updating so you may have noticed

265
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,519
that a little while back iir disappeared

266
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,159
uh I'll talk more about why I redirect

267
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,240
disappeared and how I rectified that

268
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,240
situation on a patreon episode in the

269
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,440
near future stay tuned I'll let you know

270
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
when I record that I'll let you know

271
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
when that's coming out but yes I

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
redirect did have to shut down for a

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,720
brief moment as I was working on getting

274
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
iy direct repaired and rebuilt and back

275
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,320
online I realized there were a lot of

276
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,120
other things that needed to be done to I

277
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,560
genetics.com I focused at that point on

278
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,240
getting iy direct back online we got

279
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,958
that one back it is up and running now I

280
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,600
genetics is under construction but I've

281
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,559
gotten most of the website back up in a

282
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,959
satisfying form but I do have to work on

283
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,239
the genetics page the genetics page is

284
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,078
currently under construction there are

285
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,600
approximately or were approximately

286
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,679
somewhere between 100 and 120 strains on

287
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,959
that website I am updating every

288
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,639
description by myself by hand one at a

289
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,278
time it is taking a little bit longer

290
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,240
than I had anticipated to do that I'm

291
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,519
doing it myself I don't have a helper

292
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,519
helping me with that I have to type in

293
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,440
Aroma flavor flowering time morphology

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,159
uh grow tips um what else smoke reports

295
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,600
a bunch of things like that I'm going

296
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,439
through my notes and finding all those

297
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,759
things compiling those and making a nice

298
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,440
new updated genetics website for you so

299
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,720
the strain page will be back also there

300
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,120
will be a patreon podcast I mentioned

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,360
this I'll do a patreon podcast about

302
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,720
what happened with iir why it had to

303
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
disappear how it came back why iy

304
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,120
genetics is set up the way that it is

305
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,240
now I will talk about that some of you

306
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,159
are going to ask about some of the new

307
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,720
stickers you're getting on your packages

308
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,319
all of that will be covered on the

309
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,160
patreon episode so if you're not already

310
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,200
on the patreon make sure you check out

311
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,439
patreon.com fromy yourheart of course

312
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,759
I'll let you know when it comes out so

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
you don't sign up for patreon for a

314
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,519
bunch of months and don't see the

315
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
episode I'm honestly still catching up

316
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,039
trying to do the website work get

317
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,120
getting my uh feet back under me after I

318
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,958
redirect got closed down and honestly

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,399
updating those website descriptions

320
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,199
takes much longer than I had anticipated

321
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,278
uh I try to do so many at one time once

322
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,278
I've got them all up there we'll go

323
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,519
ahead and relaunch that page it's under

324
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,919
construction let me continue uh also I

325
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,078
was ready for that question so thank you

326
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,399

they are looking like absolute fire bro

380
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,120
if you've got a good lineup right there

381
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,919
the LJ and the OG are great together two

382
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,039
of my favorites I put my name on one of

383
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,519
them and the other one is my best seller

384
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:22,599
good work Crush those together it says I

385
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,039
had a question about finishing a plant

386
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,959
in flow that's a good question it goes

387
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,519
on it says I know there are several

388
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,479
products in the market to help finish a

389
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,560
plant and I have several different

390
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
products but I'm not sure which one I

391
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,439
should use and if I can combine products

392
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,800
then he goes on to list the products so

393
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
what they're asking about is which

394
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,319
products to use for finishing the plants

395
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,919
there a lot of so there are some

396
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,639
products that are sold as just plant

397
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,399
finishers there are products that are

398
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,600
sold as flushing agents and pl products

399
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,759
that are supposed that's harder to say

400
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,480
than it looks you guys put all those

401
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,959
peas those Peter Piper sold a product

402
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,959
for flushing purple plants uh try to say

403
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,719
that in a row bro but um there are

404
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,078
products that they sell to help you

405
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,480
flush your plants there are products

406
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,919
that they sell to help the plants finish

407
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
there are many products available uh

408
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,198
many of them are unnecessary there is

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,120
one that I do recommend that is actually

410
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,198
on this list so we are going to talk

411
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,159
about some of the products that my

412
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,719
friend has they were kind enough to

413
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,278
include a list with the message and it

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,440
goes like this it says I have unsulfured

415
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,519
molasses you don't need that toward the

416
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
finishing stage of the plants uh that is

417
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
more to feed the microbes at this point

418
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,039
you've got a good microb colony in that

419
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,480
rizosphere you can probably cut out the

420
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,838
unsulfured molasses the end of the grow

421
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,278
it says I've got can ofme I would assume

422
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,199
that's an enzyme product um I would use

423
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,600
that sparingly toward the end of flour

424
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,198
you don't need a whole bunch of enzymes

425
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,920
but keep a little bit of in that in

426
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,198
there just to keep cleaning up that root

427
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,000
Zone and if you're running Hydro

428
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,000
definitely continue to use that then it

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,759
also says I have a flushing agent called

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,360
florac clean uh I don't think you need

431
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,039
floral clean I don't think a flushing

432
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,600
agent like that is necessary at all uh

433
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,838
most of the time that is just an agent

434
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,360
that will get in there and break up the

435
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
salts that are bound into your plant

436
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
help those uh loosen up from the

437
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,759
rizosphere and help you clean out the

438
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,879
rizosphere if you were watering properly

439
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,039
getting runoff not overfeeding I don't

440
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,879
think that's necessary so you could

441
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,958
probably skip the floral clean unless

442
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,399
you really want to use it if you do use

443
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,399
that uh use as directed for your last

444
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,198
two maybe three waterings at the most uh

445
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,958
then it says I've got New Millennium

446
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,719
winter frost uh I strongly recommend

447
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,879
using winter frost as recommended on the

448
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
bottle do it just like it says uh the

449
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,639
folks at winter frost are freaking

450
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,519
genius are the folks at New Millennium

451
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,919
winter frost is a great bottle I

452
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,639
recommend using that exactly as

453
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,719
recommended so use your nutrients up

454
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,799
until the day uh that you decide to use

455
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,959
the winter frost use the winter frost

456
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,799
and then follow those instructions so if

457
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,919
you're finishing with your products that

458
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,159
you've got that's what I would recommend

459
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,559
then it says here's the part where I

460
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,759
really wanted to talk I just wanted to

461
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,159
answer the question so I could talk

462
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,318
about this part it says I currently grow

463
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,838

464
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,519

465
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,199

and a promix ocean Forest 50/50 soil mix

467

friend even I'm going to even though I'm

484
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,239
going to say Sanic is not a thing we've

485
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,479
got to stop saying Sanic Sanic is like

486
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,318
saying I'm vegan but I eat steak on

487
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,879
Thursday that means you're not vegan

488
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:49,120
organic means it is made up of organic

489
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,679
elements there is no nonorganic thing in

490
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,198
your mixture right but when you add

491
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,000
something that's not organic guess what

492
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,399
you just did you wiped out you erased

493
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,720
the word organic you can't say it

494
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,600
anymore so Sanic dude that's driving me

495
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,120
crazy just say I used a mixture of

496
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,798
bottled nutrients or just don't say

497
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,640
Sanic just don't say that that's the

498
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,679
best way I could put it is to say uh I'm

499
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,038
sober but I do heroin on Friday that's

500
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,640
what Sanic sounds like to me like it's

501
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,119
not it's just not that's my rant that's
