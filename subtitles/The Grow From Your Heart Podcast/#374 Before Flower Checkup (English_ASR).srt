00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
welcome to the show cannabis community

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,569
it's time for episode 374 of the girl

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,979
from your heart podcast this episode of

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,080
the show is brought to you by the hella

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,000
dank seed company if you need new seeds

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,769
for your garden I highly recommend the

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,768
hell a dank seed company and you can

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:25,500
find them at www.sedar.com I'm smoking I

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:28,589
just took a gigantic dab of Sour clem

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,929
ambrosia the label says it has 71 point

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,450
one percent THC and a total of eighty

12
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,219
five point seven percent cannabinoids it

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,899
does not have much more information on

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,000
the label here this came from our

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,039
friends at apothecary farms in Pueblo

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,808
that's right apothecary has recently

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,909
opened a Pueblo location so make sure

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,488
you check that out but today I picked up

19
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,738
the sour clam ambrosia I think it is

20
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:53,099
Sour Diesel and clementine it's got a

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:56,179
really sweet delicious orange e citrusy

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,058
Clementine aroma followed by a funky

23
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:01,829
Sour Diesel lis just nasty aroma in the

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,659
background and I say nasty but I mean it

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,640
in the best way it is delicious it is

26
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,438
pungent so it's a little sweet it's a

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,060
little sour and then when you dab it it

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,009
goes straight to the brain and makes

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,478
your eyes open wide up it makes you talk

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,150
a lot it makes you real rambly so I

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,739
think this will be great podcast dabs

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,630
shout out to our friends and apothecary

33
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,060
farms and an extra big shout out to the

34
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,728
Pueblo crew I'm really diggin this batch

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,680
of Sour clem ambrosia all right you guys

36
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,750
let's jump into a podcast I want to do

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,640
another grow lesson I've been doing a

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,859
long series of grow lessons if you're a

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,349
new listener I suggest you go back to at

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,239
least episode 351 and start on the grow

41
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,099
lesson series if you feel like you're

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,429
caught up welcome to the grow lessons

43
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:43,949
today we are going to do a before flower

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,930
checkup so far in my grow lessons we

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,939
should have healthy happy veg plants

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,100
that are in their final finishing pots I

47
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,048
suggested three five or seven gallon

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,969
pots if you want to go larger you do it

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,590
your way it is your grow hopefully

50
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:57,209
you've topped these plants you've got a

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,579
nice canopy going hopefully you've got a

52
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,500
big fat healthy root system going we're

53
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,209
aiming for healthy happy plants that are

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,218
thriving hopefully we don't have any

55
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,899
bugs hopefully you haven't over

56
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,560
fertilized hopefully you haven't had any

57
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,489
pH issues hopefully we haven't had any

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,170
environmental problems that we didn't

59
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,740
expect hopefully everything's going well

60
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,899
and

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,219
you've got big fat healthy plants that

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,110
are almost ready to flower they're

63
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,609
probably about knee-high at this point

64
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,560
maybe a little bit taller depending on

65
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,330
what kind of lights you're using what

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,219
kind of genetics you're working with how

67
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,690
often you've been feeding them what kind

68
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,789
of treatment you've been giving them our

69
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,099
plants are probably getting large enough

70
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,789
to consider putting them into flour very

71
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,530
soon

72
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,269
before we go into flour I feel like

73
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,550
there are a few important points we

74
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,610
should cover so let's go over my before

75
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,410
flower checkup as it gets close to

76
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,170
flower time one of the first things I

77
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,210
think about is do I have clones

78
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,549
do you have clones for the next run do

79
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,129
you want to be self-sufficient if so you

80
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,050
need to create clones for your next run

81
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,719
before you put your plants in the flower

82
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,820
I don't recommend taking clones from

83
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,259
flowering plants some people will do it

84
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,599
some people will teach you how to do it

85
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,429
that is not my style I highly recommend

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,739
that you get your clones from your

87
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,550
vegging plants so before you put your

88
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,439
plants into flour

89
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,900
do you have clones do you have a way to

90
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,909
supply plants for your next cycle if you

91
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,950
plan on growing from seed again or if

92
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,719
you plan on purchasing new clones from a

93
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,759
friend or a dispensary or however you

94
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,379
get your clones that's cool if you're

95
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,870
trying to be self-sufficient now is the

96
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,299
time to think about making clones from

97
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,530
your current plants now if you decide

98
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,960
that you want to be self-sufficient

99
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,789
you've got a couple of options you may

100
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,640
want to designate one of your clones as

101
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:38,099
a mother plant here's the idea behind a

102
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,559
mother plant a mother plant is a clone

103
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,689
of a plant that we have grown and tested

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,430
and we know is reliable we know that

105
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,990
that plant is a female we know that it

106
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,550
puts off a good harvest weight we know

107
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,590
that it is potent we know that it tastes

108
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,050
good and we hopefully have learned that

109
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,150
it is pathogen and pest resistant so

110
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,890
we've got a reliable strain that we want

111
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,629
to keep around in the garden and the way

112
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,969
we do that is just by keeping it in a

113
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,219
vegetative stage perpetually and then we

114
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,629
can take clones from it as needed the

115
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,969
way you keep that mother plant in a

116
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,620
vegetative stage is by leaving it under

117
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,689
at least eighteen hours of light every

118
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,150
day for mother plants sometimes I would

119
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,069
recommend 20 on and four off maybe for

120
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,410
stubborn mother plants I may even go all

121
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,060
the way up to 24 hours on we've talked a

122
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,640
little bit about that in previous

123
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,589
episodes I've also done a full episode

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,740
about mother plants I suggest you check

125
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,189
out episode 315 for a full breakdown of

126
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,259
mother plants

127
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,850
now if you don't have room and space for

128
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,409
an extra plant maybe you just can't have

129
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,450
that extra plant because of your plant

130
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,910
count because of state laws another

131
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,550
option is to clone off of your veg

132
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,650
plants perpetually a lot of people will

133
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,629
say that will create something we used

134
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,159
to call genetic drift I do not believe

135
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,139
in that if the plants are healthy I've

136
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,390
done a full Episode on that as well

137
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,430
let's get back on track the idea of

138
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,269
taking clones from your veg plants is

139
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,129
very simple

140
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,169
you've got veg plants they're about to

141
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,029
go into flour right before you take them

142
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,580
into the flour room take a couple of

143
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,319
clones off of each of your veg plants if

144
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,969
you have faith in your clone taking

145
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,980
skills and you don't have room for an

146
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,650
extra mother plant this is an ideal way

147
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,080
to do things again some people may claim

148
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:13,599
that this will result in genetic drift I

149
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,919
do not believe in genetic drift I don't

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,350
believe in it so much that I have

151
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,259
changed my vocabulary to where I call

152
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,879
what is known as genetic drift to

153
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,920
regenerative mutation I've done a full

154
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,540
Episode on genetic drift if you'd like

155
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,699
to learn more about it I recommend you

156
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,770
listen to the episode and that's episode

157
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,569
number 343 and it's actually titled

158
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:33,549
genetic drift I suggest you give it a

159
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,699
listen and understand why we now call it

160
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,259
regenerative mutation so the point of

161
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,689
that rant is to make sure that you have

162
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,550
got clones for your next run if you

163
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,680
don't have a supplier a provider or a

164
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,720
source for your next batch of clones it

165
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,910
may be really advantageous to take a few

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,590
clones start vegging them out so that

167
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,600
way you've got another crop lined up

168
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:54,729
before you even have this one finished

169
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,379
if you really want to max productivity

170
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,060
of your grow you'll start running what

171
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,949
is known as a perpetual grow where you

172
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,019
use two spaces you've got a veg space

173
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,149
you've got a flowering space as soon as

174
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,310
that flowering crop is done you cut it

175
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,259
down you clean the room you reset the

176
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,269
room and you drag a set of flowering

177
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,159
plants right back in there and you never

178
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,289
miss a beat that room never gets a break

179
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,550
so you're always on top of production

180
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,590
which means you always have to have a

181
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,449
supply of clones so you'll have veg

182
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,099
plants you'll cut a few clones off of

183
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,110
them you'll cut down your flowering

184
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,730
plants you'll clean up that room drag

185
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,020
those veg plants right into there and

186
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,580
then you'll start growing those little

187
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,859
clones up into the next batch there'll

188
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,539
be your veg plants you have to top them

189
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,730
you have to train them you've got a full

190
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,200
nine weeks to get them as big as you

191
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,240
need them and get them prepared for the

192
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,439
next run so when that flowering crop

193
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,990
gets done that you've got in the

194
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,360
flowering room you cut it down clean

195
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,430
drag those veg plants right in there but

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,410
before you do that you take a few clones

197
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,840
so that you can keep the cycle going the

198
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,919
idea is to create a perpetual cycle for

199
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,569
yourself so you're always

200
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,668
self-sufficient you never have to bring

201
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,349
anything in from outside that way you

202
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:57,879
can keep the grow clean that way you

203
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,439
know if you get any bugs or any pests

204
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,569
it's your fault you can't blame anybody

205
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,550
else but it really limits the

206
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,978
opportunities to bring in problems and

207
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,810
it also helps you develop a relationship

208
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,788
with one strain if you run a perpetual

209
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,889
grow with just one maybe two strains max

210
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,389
you can really dial those strains in you

211
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,949
can build a relationship with them and

212
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,139
then you can get them to reach their

213
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,629
full potential there are several ways to

214
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,610
do perpetual grows you can do it by

215
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,168
swapping the whole room you can do it by

216
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,210
having part of the room harvest every

217
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:27,668
couple of weeks I've done a full Episode

218
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,948
on that but I do plan to redo it in the

219
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:32,228
future for a six plant count because

220
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,538
Colorado is now limited to six plants

221
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:37,060
for recreational or medical patients so

222
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:39,610
I will do a revised perpetual grow

223
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,228
episode based on a six plant count if

224
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,629
you're interested in listening to the

225
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:45,848
current or maybe the old scheduling a

226
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,339
perpetual grow episode that is episode

227
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:50,709
number 73 I think it is a great episode

228
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,679
I put a lot of time and effort into

229
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:56,500
creating that episode so episode 73 all

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,269
about creating a perpetual grow alright

231
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,158
let me get myself back on track my point

232
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:02,228
is to make sure you have got either a

233
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,569
source for clones or clones for your

234
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,399
next run and also it is always a good

235
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,228
idea to think about becoming more

236
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,978
self-sufficient and you can do so by

237
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:13,930
creating a perpetual grow now the next

238
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:15,639
thing on my checklist that I would think

239
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,129
about in this brand new grow room that

240
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,560
we just recently built is do we have any

241
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,870
light leaks do we have grow lights

242
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,000
leaking out into the outside and do we

243
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,038
have outside lights leaking into the

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,079
inside this is very important to find

245
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,899
out before we go into the flower phase

246
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,328
we need to go in that grow room and turn

247
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,610
off the grow lights and sit in there for

248
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,668
15 or 20 minutes and let your eyes

249
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,399
adjust to the total darkness and see if

250
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:44,919
you see any light at all in your

251
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
flowering room if you can see any light

252
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,939
that is too much you should not be able

253
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,520
to see your hand in front of your own

254
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,170
face it needs to be completely dark I've

255
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,059
done an episode called total darkness

256
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,740
check that one out also

257
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:58,809
any light leaks in the flowering phase

258
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,850
are going to cause your plants problems

259
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,409
you're either going to get no flowering

260
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,940
at all you're going to get slow

261
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,439
flowering or you're going to get

262
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,760
hermaphrodites you'll get plants that

263
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,070
will start to flower and they'll never

264
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,350
finish or he just may get crazy weird

265
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,900
mutated plants because of an odd light

266
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,700
leak so go in the grow room turn off all

267
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,529
the grow lights and just sit there for a

268
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,270
few minutes put your phone away don't

269
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,399
have any light making your eyes do weird

270
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:23,620
things just let there be total darkness

271
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,389
let your eyes adjust and if you see any

272
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,490
light you need to correct it you need

273
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:28,659
some of that silver foil tape or maybe

274
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,070
you need to fill the gaps with some

275
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,169
caulk and cover it up with some duct

276
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,810
tape just seal up all of those light

277
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:37,959
leaks now if your grow room is on an

278
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:40,569
exterior wall meaning that wall is next

279
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,730
to the outside or if there is a lot of

280
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,340
activity on the opposite side of the

281
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,590
wall of what you are growing I suggest

282
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,600
you go in your grow room and turn off

283
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,120
the grow lights during either the

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,490
sunshine hours or the busy hours of that

285
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,740
room and see if any of the light from

286
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,750
either the Sun or that adjacent room are

287
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,240
leaking into your grow room during their

288
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,980
busy hours if your grow room has a

289
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,419
window and the sun is shining on that

290
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,370
window and the curtains aren't thick

291
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,199
enough to block out that Sun or whatever

292
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,149
you've put over that window is not thick

293
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,980
enough to block out that sunlight we

294
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,100
need to know that before we go into the

295
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,840
flowering phase the Sun may come up an

296
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,269
hour before your grow lights come on

297
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,340
they may start getting a full hour of

298
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:23,049
sunlight coming through that window that

299
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,629
you're unaware of and that's going to

300
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,849
disrupt their flowering cycle so go in

301
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,259
there and check it all hours and see if

302
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,899
you are getting total darkness

303
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,850
especially the hours you plan on putting

304
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,459
your plants in their night cycle make

305
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,889
sure that room is actually dark and if

306
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,050
it's not correct it now the next thing

307
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,939
we need to do is the opposite we need to

308
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,889
go outside and make sure that none of

309
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,230
our grow room lights are leaking to the

310
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,179
outside especially if you're running

311
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,980
your grow lights during the outside

312
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,419
night cycle you were lighting up the

313
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,190
outside neighborhood with your grow

314
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,870
lights those grow lights are going to

315
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,970
bring unwanted attention you will bring

316
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,549
thieves and law enforcement so make sure

317
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,009
you're not leaking any light out of your

318
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:05,019
grow room now is also a good time to

319
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,210
start thinking about when am I going to

320
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,590
run my flowering cycle do you want the

321
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,660
lights on when it

322
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,420
dark outside do you want the lights on

323
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,850
when it's light outside electricity is

324
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,199
cheaper during off-peak hours which

325
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,360
means when all the business is closed

326
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,550
and everybody goes home electricity gets

327
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,528
cheaper you can look on your bill and

328
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:26,859
find out when peak and off-peak hours

329
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:29,080
are since electricity is more affordable

330
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,850
at off-peak hours many growers will

331
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,150
choose to run their lights during those

332
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,830
hours also when the Sun is not up we

333
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,838
don't have to try to keep the room cool

334
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,970
with the grow lights and the Sun

335
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,980
competing against us when the Sun Goes

336
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,050
Down it automatically gets a little bit

337
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,759
cooler outside you can fire up your grow

338
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,889
lights and you don't have as much heat

339
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,720
to deal with if you're in a place that

340
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,429
gets really cold you can run those grow

341
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,050
lights at night and it will really help

342
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:54,669
keep your house warm if you've got a

343
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,859
small house and you run the ducting

344
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,778
right and you plan properly I know

345
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,580
several East Coast growers that used to

346
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:02,559
keep their apartments warm by setting up

347
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,509
a four or six hundred watt light in the

348
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,909
winter it would kick out a small winter

349
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,289
crop of super potent cannabis out of

350
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,149
their very small apartment and they

351
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:12,069
would also use that same light to keep

352
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:13,629
themselves warm so there's a very

353
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,580
efficient way to do things back in the

354
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,230
day so now is a good time to start

355
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,330
thinking about when you're going to run

356
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,980
your lights in your flowering room you

357
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,690
probably have to go to work part of the

358
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,940
day do you want those lights to come on

359
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,320
right when you get home from work do you

360
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,940
want those lights to come on so you can

361
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,740
work on the plants before you go to work

362
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,640
you've got a lot of things to plan and

363
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,409
think about now

364
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,970
I suggest you work on the plants after

365
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:36,850
work because you don't want to go to

366
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,830
work smelling like dank most people work

367
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,600
a day job nowadays so you're gonna go to

368
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,759
work and then you'll get off hopefully

369
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,019
in the evening come home work on the

370
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,549
plants that works out really well

371
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,220
because you are now on off-peak

372
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,509
electricity hours and it is nighttime so

373
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,399
you're not fighting that heat you don't

374
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:53,139
have to run as much electricity so you

375
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,789
get off work come home work on the

376
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,649
plants then you could take a nice shower

377
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:57,909
then you don't stink for work next day

378
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,708
and nobody knows if you're growing

379
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,809
cannabis if you were in a place you need

380
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,039
to keep it on the down-low alright and

381
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,139
since I'm talking about being careful

382
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,449
and keeping it on the down-low do you

383
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,759
have a carbon filter set up as your

384
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,550
filtration in place are you ready for a

385
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,230
stinky crop of flowers in just a few

386
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,629
weeks these plants are going to start

387
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,509
stinking very heavily you may get a nice

388
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,220
aroma around 20 days in depending on

389
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,009
your genetics and what you're using for

390
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,350
nutrients

391
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,299
and the airflow in your room now is the

392
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,159
time to order a carbon filter if you

393
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:29,870
haven't already you need to get that set

394
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,279
up you need to get it in place and you

395
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,310
need to start controlling the aroma

396
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,870
leaving your grow space now I need to

397
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,250
back up and cover one thing that I

398
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,519
overlooked when I was talking about

399
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,350
light leaks when you were using vented

400
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,199
lights which means you have got a light

401
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,480
with glass between the bulb and the

402
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,310
plant canopy and that's all sealed up in

403
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,320
there and it's got a duct coming off of

404
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:52,909
one end and off of the other and you're

405
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,290
blowing a blower over it to get that

406
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:56,629
heat from the light out of the grow

407
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,579
space a lot of people will run that

408
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:01,100
ducting to the outside of the house

409
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,560
they'll run out of a window just to make

410
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,009
it go outside of the house somehow a lot

411
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,779
of times the sunshine will reflect write

412
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,090
down that ducting and come into your

413
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,279
light reflector and work just like a

414
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,019
light you were channeling that light

415
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,750
down that ducting right into your grow

416
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:20,059
space if you are not doing that while

417
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,769
the lights are on you were lighting up

418
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,979
the plants and disrupting your night

419
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:27,319
cycle if you were using ducted hoods and

420
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,350
you were running that to the outside of

421
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,840
the house you may need to adjust the

422
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,360
duct to where the light does not make it

423
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,889
into your grow room

424
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,870
unfortunately the inside of that ducting

425
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,419
is quite often made with a very

426
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,149
reflective material you're probably

427
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,339
going to have to give it a lot of bends

428
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,470
or you'll have to create a baffle at the

429
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,620
end of it or the light is not allowed to

430
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:54,710
even enter down that ducting another

431
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,590
option is to get a can of flat black

432
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,629
spray paint and spray paint the inside

433
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,030
as far as you can make that spray paint

434
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:03,769
go just put a nice little black layer in

435
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,600
there and take that reflective layer off

436
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,000
and that will prevent the light from

437
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,860
getting in there as much you still may

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,139
need to make a bend you may need to put

439
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,289
some sort of light baffle over it but

440
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:17,620
please check and see if the light is

441
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:20,240
coming through your ducted hoods and

442
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,970
disrupting your night cycle the sunshine

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,360
will make it so far down that ducting

444
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,610
you will be amazed and just one little

445
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,649
speckle of sunlight will completely

446
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,180
disrupt your flowering cycle if you

447
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,980
think the plants are in the dark and

448
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,229
they're getting that one little pinprick

449
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,360
of sunlight they're not

450
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,920
in the dark and also take a quick look

451
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,629
at all of the equipment in your grow

452
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,519
room does your air conditioner have blue

453
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,990
and red lights on it is there something

454
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,210
in the grow room that's illuminating a

455
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,009
blue display if you have any lights in

456
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,870
there you need to put some tape or some

457
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,669
sort of a flap over it so that light

458
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,429
does not disrupt your flowering cycle

459
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:56,469
the only color of light that is

460
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,449
acceptable during the night cycle is a

461
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,670
green light and there are still

462
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,890
situations where I have seen those green

463
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:05,199
lights cause problems with people's

464
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,870
plants by running that green light too

465
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,240
much during a dark cycle I would prefer

466
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,860
it be completely dark in your grow room

467
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,899
there's nobody in there

468
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,419
the plants are sleeping we don't want

469
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,459
any light make it as dark as you can get

470
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,620
it you want it scary dark and then a

471
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,240
little bit darker you don't want to be

472
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,620
able to see your hand in front of your

473
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,840
face when you're touching your nose

474
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,120
that's how dark we need it again I've

475
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,350
done an episode called total darkness so

476
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,480
give that one a listen if you don't

477
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,580
understand why total darkness is so

478
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,860
important in our indoor grow environment

479
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,830
all right the next thing on my pre

480
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,080
flower checklist is can you correctly

481
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,840
identify females males and

482
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,850
hermaphrodites if you are running from

483
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,060
seed especially you have got the option

484
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:52,149
to run into females males or

485
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:55,389
hermaphrodites you need to be able to

486
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:58,230
identify these very early if you find a

487
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,819
male in the garden it needs to be cold

488
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,100
immediately if you come across a

489
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,900
hermaphroditic plant early in flower you

490
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,640
need to know what that looks like so you

491
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,759
can get it out of the grow room before

492
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,800
it causes you problems your plants are

493
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,220
going to start showing sex somewhere

494
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,379
around 10 days into flower by day 12 or

495
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,799
14 it will be really obvious if you've

496
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,410
got male or female plants by day 12 or

497
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,990
14 your female plants will be able to

498
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,430
receive pollen from the male plants if

499
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,819
you're not paying attention

500
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,009
sometimes by day 10 or 12 a male plant

501
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,929
can open up and start dropping pollen

502
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,670
now your whole crop is pollinated

503
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,350
everything is going to have seeds in it

504
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,870
and you didn't even know because you

505
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:43,599
weren't paying attention so before we

506
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:45,939
get to this risky phase open up some

507
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,339
books do some Google searches and learn

508
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,029
to identify a female cannabis plant

509
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,549
learn

510
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:53,920
to confidently identify a male cannabis

511
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,009
plant and learn how to identify a plant

512
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,440
that shows both sexes in the same plant

513
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,299
in the next episode I plan to talk about

514
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,279
Fino hunting and selecting a mother

515
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,589
plant from that Fino hunt in that

516
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,809
episode I will also include a talk about

517
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,879
sexing our cannabis plants it is very

518
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,769
important at this phase in this stage of

519
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,770
the game so we need to know how to

520
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,869
confidently identify males and females I

521
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:19,059
will be able to provide you detailed

522
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,759
descriptions but I recommend you look

523
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,159
online for pictures of males and females

524
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,259
of cannabis plants they are very easy to

525
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,360
spot once you look a few times it will

526
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,879
become very obvious you just need to

527
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,799
develop the confidence so I will include

528
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,170
a talk about it on the next episode but

529
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,589
you will still need to go look in a book

530
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,580
or look online and get a good visual

531
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:41,589
understanding of what you are looking

532
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:43,569
for so you can spot it right away if

533
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:45,339
something should pop up in your garden

534
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,899
now another thing you should think about

535
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:49,419
before you put your plants into flower

536
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,190
is are they healthy have you burned them

537
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,050
with nutrients are they nutrient

538
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,730
deficient we may want to get them a

539
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,259
little healthier before you put them

540
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,089
into flour we want these plants as

541
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:00,099
healthy as we can get them before they

542
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:02,379
go into the flowering phase another

543
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:05,859
important thing to think about is do you

544
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,540
have any pest infestations we aren't

545
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:10,029
able to spray the plants with as many

546
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:13,509
products once we get bud set so we want

547
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:16,539
to eradicate any pest problems before we

548
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:18,640
go into the flowering phase if you do

549
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,440
have a pest problem at this time it is

550
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,780
time to step up the frequency of the

551
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,700
sprays and quite possibly increase the

552
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,910
potency of your sprays if not start

553
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,529
introducing new products we do not want

554
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,230
to enter the flowering phase with a

555
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:35,470
known pest problem it is much easier to

556
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,000
combat a pest problem while in veg so

557
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,130
let's focus on getting rid of any

558
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,230
problems now and then we can move to

559
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,210
flower a week late if that's what we

560
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,519
need to do or we can adjust our plans

561
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,740
accordingly but let's make sure to get

562
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,779
rid of every bug before we move to

563
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,910
flower so at this point we should have

564
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,829
some backup clones for the next run we

565
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,240
know that the room is dark we know there

566
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:56,710
are no light leaks there's no light

567
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,319
getting in there's no light getting out

568
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,759
we've got our aroma control there's no

569
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,589
stinky air getting out of the grow room

570
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,329
you guys the number one

571
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:06,099
way people get in trouble is by having

572
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,740
stinky air coming out of the house

573
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,149
control that aroma make sure you take

574
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,490
care of that we're allowed to grow

575
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,679
cannabis in Colorado you were just fine

576
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,900
until somebody complains and says they

577
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,880
can smell your garden at that point they

578
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,620
send out an investigator and they come

579
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,659
knock on your door and ask to look and

580
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,399
see how many plants you've got if you've

581
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:26,470
got too many plants you do get in

582
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,690
trouble so no matter how many plants

583
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,490
you've got I recommend you've got some

584
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,409
sort of odor control so none of your

585
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,089
neighbors get mad nobody's snitches on

586
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,278
you nobody comes knocking on your door

587
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:38,349
even if you are within your legal amount

588
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,880
of plants it is still nerve-racking and

589
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,009
stressful to have to deal with law

590
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,220
enforcement because of your cannabis so

591
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:47,048
simply control the odor so again we've

592
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,970
got clones for the next round we've got

593
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:51,308
a nice dark room we are controlling the

594
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,528
odor that is leaving our room we know

595
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:55,480
how to identify males females and

596
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:56,950
hermaphrodites we know what to coal so

597
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,419
that we don't cause any problems in the

598
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,120
grow so that we don't seed up our whole

599
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:03,100
grow we know there are no pests we know

600
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,979
we haven't overfed the plants we are

601
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:07,928
almost ready to flower now how do we

602
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,579
know when to flower these plants there

603
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,009
are a couple of things that will help us

604
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:14,558
determine when to initiate the flowering

605
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:17,019
phase for our plants one of the main

606
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,178
factors will be the height how much

607
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:21,940
ceiling space do you have in your grow

608
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,100
most of us are in a residential area a

609
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,620
lot of us are going to be modifying a

610
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:29,230
bedroom or something similar a lot of us

611
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,729
may be using grow tents you're going to

612
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,679
have to flower your plants at a height

613
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,659
where they have plenty of rooms to grow

614
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,000
to where they don't work themselves into

615
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,919
the lights and you run out of space you

616
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,778
need to plan to leave depending on what

617
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,759
type of light you were using you need to

618
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:44,679
plan to leave an appropriate gap between

619
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,500
the top of your plants and your light

620
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,538
source if you're using LEDs you can get

621
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,190
much closer if you're using the ceramic

622
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:52,960
metal halides you can get kind of close

623
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,700
if you're using a high pressure sodium

624
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,350
light you need to stay kind of a

625
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,058
distance away if you're using a

626
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:01,119
double-ended Gavita you need to stay

627
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:03,759
even further away so plan for that when

628
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,109
you're planning your flowering time now

629
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,908
a good thing to think of when you were

630
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,829
new at growing and you haven't grown a

631
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,659
lot of crops and you want to prepare for

632
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:13,720
flowering time and have enough space is

633
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:16,440
prepare for your plants to double in

634
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,539
height if you were growing a sativa

635
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,460
train or something a sativa hybrid with

636
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,009
a lot of sativa genetics in there it

637
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,200
could double in height throughout the

638
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:27,180
flowering phase so if you veg your plant

639
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,250
and the plant is 3 feet tall you

640
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,039
initiate flower by the time it is done

641
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,410
you can expect a six foot tall plant if

642
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,440
you're not doing anything to control

643
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,420
that vertical growth so in that case I

644
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,610
would plant a flower that plant if you

645
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,410
have got if your light is 6 feet tall

646
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:45,899
we're gonna say if your light is 7 feet

647
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,610
tall because we need some space if your

648
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,590
light is 7 feet off the ground

649
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,479
I would veg those plants the first time

650
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,769
I grow them I would veg them until they

651
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,930
are 3 feet tall

652
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,759
once they're 3 feet tall initiate the

653
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,590
flower phase they're gonna double in

654
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,299
height they'll end about 6 feet tall

655
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,639
you'll still have that 1 foot of space

656
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,980
between the light and the canopy now

657
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,200
this is not a rule this is just a guide

658
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,940
if you have not grown your strain before

659
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,519
if you don't know what these genetics

660
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,500
are going to do allow yourself room for

661
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,329
these plants to double of course if

662
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,579
you've got plants with big obvious fat

663
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:19,589
white indica leaves you may not get that

664
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,029
doubled growth you may only get a little

665
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:23,189
bit of growth you're going to get

666
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,690
stretch for about 3 weeks and then

667
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,630
they'll slow down on the stretching and

668
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,049
the bud sets will really set in but try

669
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,850
to plan ahead for too much head space

670
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,789
there's nothing worse than having a big

671
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:37,949
giant beautiful top Cola that is just

672
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,599
beefy and covered in trichomes and then

673
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,730
it starts murdering itself by growing

674
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,109
directly into your lights it starts

675
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,329
touching the light it starts burning

676
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:46,529
itself it starts getting ugly colors you

677
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:48,179
have to think about do I want to bend

678
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,889
that bud over do I actually want to cut

679
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,140
part of that off what do I do at this

680
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,670
point that is really heartbreaking so

681
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,660
plan ahead and try to give yourself

682
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,650
plenty of headspace also keep in mind

683
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,450
spacing you don't want the plants

684
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,250
touching each other too much I just

685
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,600
think about if you and I and another

686
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,400
couple of dudes we're hanging out in a

687
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,899
room if we all just started spreading

688
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,340
our arms around just touching each other

689
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,540
all weird you're gonna get kind of

690
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,129
weirded out you're like bro why you

691
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,559
touching me and you're gonna want your

692
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,630
own space the plants are very similar

693
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,429
when one plant feels another plant touch

694
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,870
it it indicates to itself I probably

695
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,670
shouldn't grow much further that way

696
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,439
because I'm already touching a limit and

697
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,820
the other plant says the same thing so

698
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,259
now you've got two plants that have just

699
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:27,599
stopped out branching and they're gonna

700
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,779
start growing up so allow your plants

701
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,389
plenty of space spread

702
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:34,910
a little bit yes we do want to maximize

703
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,890
canopy space we do want to maximize the

704
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,600
space of our grow but we don't want to

705
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,430
crush them in so much we can't get

706
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,409
airflow we don't want to crush them in

707
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,880
so much that they're uncomfortable we

708
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,710
need a little bit of airflow and we

709
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,910
don't want leaves stacking on top of

710
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,890
each other because that's where you

711
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,080
start causing problems so give them some

712
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,610
space space your plants out give them

713
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,829
some breathing room give them some

714
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:56,240
growing room and keep in mind that when

715
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,919
you put your plants into the flowering

716
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,960
phase they are only halfway through

717
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,490
their life cycle they still need to Bush

718
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,500
out a little bit they're gonna grow much

719
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,069
taller you're only halfway there so

720
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,539
allow that extra space for flowering now

721
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:09,409
if you're running a screen of green or a

722
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,659
trellis system

723
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,150
I suggest you veg until you kind of fill

724
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,100
out most of that screen system the idea

725
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,960
is to try to get one little branch

726
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,609
coming through each of those squares in

727
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,500
your trellis system if you can maximize

728
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:23,629
that that's when you really start

729
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,720
cranking out as much bud as you can

730
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,000
produce in your space so I suggest you

731
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,950
fill that canopy up and fill that screen

732
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,450
up before you flower because you're

733
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,069
spreading it out nice and white it's not

734
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,750
going straight up like the guys without

735
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,519
the screen if you're spreading it out

736
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,500
you've still got all that vertical

737
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,819
growth left for you so you can spread it

738
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,529
out then put it into flower and it's

739
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,599
gonna grow vertically for you so I

740
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:46,879
recommend you use all of that screen

741
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,809
space to the best of your ability all

742
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
right I feel like that is a good

743
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,190
explanation of when to flower the plants

744
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,809
you want to give yourself about double

745
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,390
the space you want to allow some space

746
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:57,740
between the whites and the plants and

747
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,509
you also want to give the plants some

748
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,460
space so they can breathe and so they

749
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:03,619
can stretch out now if you've done any

750
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,289
topping I would definitely recommend 10

751
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:08,179
to 14 days of recovery time before you

752
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:10,579
move the plants into flower so plan

753
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,440
ahead do all of your topping plenty of

754
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:14,299
time in advance so the plants can heal

755
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,460
so they can redistribute the hormones

756
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:18,859
that way the plant can produce big fat

757
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,299
chunky top buds if you top a plant and

758
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,219
move it into flower too soon you'll

759
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:24,139
notice those top buds don't really

760
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,940
produce the colas that we were expecting

761
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,860
so give your plant time to recover from

762
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,509
topping let those hormones move around

763
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:32,000
and it will make a huge difference in

764
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,099
the productivity of your plant so I feel

765
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,049
like that is a pretty good before flower

766
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:37,879
checklist make sure the plants are

767
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,859
healthy make sure you understand how to

768
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,140
find males females and hermaphrodites

769
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:43,609
make sure your pest free and make sure

770
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,559
you've got a good idea of when so

771
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:47,959
flower those plants try to set a

772
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,629
schedule try to stick to it as long as

773
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,519
you are pest free I would suggest that

774
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,260
you keep twisting and popping the stems

775
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,730
making those stalks nice and robust

776
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,679
until it's time to flower

777
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,509
keep pulling off any yellow or funky

778
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,019
leaves keep the plants looking nice and

779
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:02,329
healthy

780
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,519
keep them thriving and when it's time to

781
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,500
flower flip that timer to twelve twelve

782
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,769
make a note of what day you did it and

783
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,210
now you were in the flowering phase

784
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,160
several people have asked me when

785
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,840
flowering starts does flowering start

786
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,850
the day you change the timer to twelve

787
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,859
twelve or does flowering start the day

788
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:20,779
you start seeing buds set if you are

789
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:22,759
looking at a package of seeds and it

790
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,970
says these seeds will take eight to ten

791
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,579
weeks to flower that eight to ten weeks

792
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,710
starts the day you change your timer to

793
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:32,480
twelve twelve the day you do the flip is

794
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,880
the beginning of your flowering phase

795
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,130
that's when that new schedule that new

796
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,250
calendars the new countdown that is when

797
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:42,350
that begins so if you were running 24

798
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,599
hours or twenty on and four off or

799
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,159
eighteen and six and veg you just go in

800
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,558
and you change that timer to twelve

801
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,960
hours on and twelve hours off and that

802
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,210
is day one of your flowering phase in

803
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,679
about ten to twelve days you'll start

804
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,450
seeing pre flower the plants will start

805
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,340
showing you sex you need to go through

806
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,130
and start pulling out all of the boys by

807
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,230
this point by day fourteen the boys will

808
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,059
be very obvious they will be getting

809
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,190
ready to pollinate if they have not

810
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,869
already dropped pollen pay close

811
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,970
attention to the boys and get them out

812
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:13,009
of there for the first two or three

813
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,440
weeks of flowering you're going to focus

814
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,690
heavily on looking for male plants and

815
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,450
plants with hermaphrodite traits and

816
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,940
removing them from the garden safely so

817
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,620
again I suggest that you start now doing

818
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,150
some research on understanding what a

819
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,489
male and a female and a hermaphrodite

820
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,530
cannabis plant look like so that when

821
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,779
you're eight ten twelve or fourteen days

822
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:34,519
into flower you were certain what you

823
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,349
see and you were confident so that you

824
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,720
can make the correct decision to keep

825
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:40,099
your garden in top shape alright I feel

826
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,870
like that is a great place to stop

827
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,730
because my next lesson is going to be

828
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:45,769
about female hunting and sexing the

829
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,230
plants and selecting a mother plant from

830
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:50,569
that Fino hunt process then we're going

831
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,549
to work our way into the flowering stage

832
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:54,740
of the grow lesson that's right it is

833
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:56,539
almost time to flower the hypothetical

834
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,048
plants in the grow lesson so that is

835
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,918
coming up

836
00:28:57,048 --> 00:29:02,808
very soon I will talk in depth about

837
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,489
probably three week chunks of the

838
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:06,259
flowering phase will probably do week

839
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:08,720
one through three and then we'll do four

840
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:10,099
through six and then we'll do seven

841
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,230
through nine that was hard for my brain

842
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:13,998
to process that quickly but that is my

843
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,889
idea for the flowering phase I'm going

844
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,999
to break it down into three three week

845
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,008
chunks and then we'll talk about

846
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:20,538
finishing the plants up so that is

847
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,519
coming up very soon so I feel like this

848
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:24,378
is a great place to wrap up this episode

849
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,849
