00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,659
do this podcast Steve you guys probably

90
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:29,349
remember if you listen to the show he is

91
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:31,599
the founder president chair dude main

92
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,849
veteran of the veteran farmers Alliance

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,799
for my listeners that haven't been

94
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,900
following will you give us a little

95
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,719
description of what the VFA does yeah

96
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,900
basically we give them a hundred dollars

97
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,659
in cash and prizes we feed them we get

98
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,620
medicated cookies medicated BBQ ribs

99
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:56,079
chicken but we're eventually gonna move

100
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,080
to live music but we give away genetics

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,630
soil nutrients just grow gear everything

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,580
so you basically hold big parties at

103
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,709
cannabis friendly venues and invite

104
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,630
veterans that are in need get them out

105
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,490
of their house put a smile on their face

106
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,379
absolutely stead of ignoring them like a

107
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,439
lot of society has chosen to do right

108
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,810
and in the way it works is I get

109
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,449
companies and other organizations

110
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:23,790
involved and they make a donation to

111
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:26,800
where it's it's what they provide as a

112
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,260
product to the industry right and so

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,669
they give it away and basically you know

114
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,168
we're gonna probably have around forty

115
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:35,379
thousand dollars in genetics to give

116
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:37,629
away I mean it's it's serious that's

117
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,589
amazing do you want to list off some of

118
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,110

125

208

was so bold thanks man I was I described

209
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,239
it in my head as if you take a purple

210
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,620
laughs at the lab and hold it in your

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,418
mouth for a couple of minutes and let it

212
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,709
start to melt that's I think that's kind

213
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,909

223
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,610
that Friday November 11th Veterans Day

224
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,110

228
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,980
accurate tomato would say that's right

229
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,409
our non-veterans invited as well as

230
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,289
veterans yes but it is $50 to get in

231
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:17,620
okay what that does is that goes to the

232
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:19,389
donation for my 501 and to basically get

233

239
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,540
plan we're gonna talk about that in a

240
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,129
minute I think absolutely so the veteran

241
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,139

242

244
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:43,230
those companies that donated products

245
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,119
are the non veterans that show up and

246
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,800

247
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,078

250
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,679
prize was a grinder so yeah you can't go

251
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,240
any better than that right and you walk

252
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,250
you win something you're happy

253
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,549

255
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,439

256
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,078
good time all right so you mentioned

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,550
trying to raise money the contributions

258
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:18,479
will go to raise money for your new 501k

259
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:22,109
c3 c5 c3 or 3c I forget how it goes I

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,490
don't it's just it's been crazy I got so

261
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:34,169
much going on it's like now I got to get

262
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:36,060
to some like it's a what what it's

263
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,528
probably I think anywhere from a

264
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,229
thousand to eleven hundred and then I

265
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:42,629
got to go to score and then they'll do

266
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,550
all the help me with the bylaws and once

267
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:45,838
that's gone and I just wanted to all be

268
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,849
legit for everybody there's a cap

269
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,769
nobody'll make hundreds of thousands of

270
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,769
dollars it'll be like 22 grand top

271
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,659
everybody like that's all the rest of

272
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,269
the donations I mean that's once we're

273
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:00,899
having we have to establish people to

274
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:03,028
hire on to travel around and and help

275
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,559
put these events on because we want it

276
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,958
instead of doing two year we want to do

277
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,669
one every month so Wow in different

278
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:13,979
locations to get more veterans and more

279
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:16,318
cities so eventually we're if we take in

280
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,420
once we start taking in a large amount

281
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:20,370
and it's like well I need to start

282
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,009
hiring people to start expanding then

283
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,560
their cap is 22 grand not eight hundred

284
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:28,230
grand okay now keep it modest for people

285
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,729
yeah it's like if you hear this for the

286
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,370
veteran farmers Alliance or regular

287
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,379
organist ravenna farmers Alliance okay

288
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,500
and and the whole point is if you're

289
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,610
coming to work like even me if I don't

290
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,980
even know if I'm gonna even take the

291
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:45,220
money but the whole point is

292
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,500
it's it's guys that needs something to

293
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,910
do its we take them out we take that

294
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,470
donation instead of putting in our

295
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:54,819
pocket right the whole nonprofit what we

296
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,550
do is we'll take that we'll take them

297
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,320
out on like fishing trips hunting trips

298
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,000
we'll take them out on backpacking trips

299
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,100
trips we'll take them down to Peru

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,409
that's more therapeutic than any kind of

301
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,220
hospital visit or psychology right

302
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:10,600
having a friend to go hang out smokes

303
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,160
eventually you'll have your camp feeling

304
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,080
right and eventually we're gonna get

305
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
acreage where we can just do this guys

306
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,850

camping trip

309
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,679
that sounds great but it's on our own

310
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,929
land so to be private land you can come

311
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,429
out and just relax just do you compress

312
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,319
some guys need that they just need a

313
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,729
reset you know a little quiet space away

314

believe it or not that [ __ ] sounds

328
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,020
exactly like it from a distance I mean

329
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,549
it's just there was last year was the

330
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:08,500
first year I ever went to the 4th of

331
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:10,269
July in eight years it was like I was

332
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,679
like man okay I can do this and I just

333
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,569

334
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,149

335
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,379

338
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,980
I'll be all right and that was kind of

339
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,329
last year about this time is when I

340
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,720
first started taking the steps to

341
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,820
recovery and yeah quick process ever

342
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,950

343
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,230
through the whole country process right

344
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:40,210

348
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,230
tired of being in my head all the time I

349

much we hit people's houses and in

400

public I try to behave person's mind a

401
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,730
little bit I really like to go to the

402
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,740
candy Canyon or somewhere when there's a

403
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,600
bunch of people and just walk in after

404
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:39,490
work and just drop a half gram dab on

405
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:39,490
the email and people like I don't work

406
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,229
maybe keeping your own head straight

407
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,060
sometimes there's plenty of work for you

408
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,060
sometimes it's video games too though

409
00:16:49,480 --> 00:17:00,680
can you play like my wife or kicker I'm

410
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:02,919

411
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:06,769
yeah you're right get off and I was like

412
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,299
that's the only thing it does right you

413
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:14,900
know it kind of like puts you back into

414
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:16,338
the mindset it's like are you really

415
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,810
good okay okay

416
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:23,119
I play bf3 on my PC all right it's not

417
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,769
bad I'm not much of a gamer I had an

418
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,919
issue with video games I had to give

419
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:29,569
them up completely yeah well when Sims

420
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,800
was popular I would show up at work and

421
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:34,700
my friends to be like did you stay up

422
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,529
all night playing The Sims yes you care

423
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,090
more about your Sims than you do you

424
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:43,730
that's what I was like right now I have

425
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,919
to check this problem so the next time I

426
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,930
move I got rid of all my gaming consoles

427
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,170
and I try really hard not to put games

428
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:56,740
in my new computer I just replaced it

429
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:56,740
with Instagram Facebook tinder Twitter

430
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:07,909

433
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:14,598
bunch of likes I guess I can't hold them

434
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,368
or do anything with them and I doubt

435
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:18,019

436
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:21,728

438
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:26,958

439
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,329

440
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:31,369
and Instagram and it was just it's it's

441
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:33,078

442
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:34,638

465
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:38,659
middle of talking about the VFA and the

466
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,978
upcoming event helping veterans I'm not

467
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:41,629
exactly sure where we jumped off the

468
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:44,328
deep end on this one but we got on a pot

469
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:44,958
head rant we use the hashtag on the

470
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:47,469
podcast

471
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:49,399
hashtag they like it when we ramble so

472
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:51,828
they know what to expect when they

473
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:55,038
listen to this show I'm pretty sure we

474
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:57,198
basically wrapped up the VFA alright so

475
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,179

476
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:00,919

478
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,190
Howie that's right so you got a place

479
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:05,749
for the veterans to go get away and beef

480
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,889

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,629
long-term points I think once we get to

490
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,430
years and what we're doing now and we

491
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,110
have the funds to really start looking I

492
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,110
think that's when we'll start sitting

493
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:32,819
down and really okay that makes good

494
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,599
sense I admire what you're trying to do

495
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,909
that's awesome

496
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:41,759
all right so what was the CEC right CVCC

497
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:45,150
Colorado veterans collective so so

498
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,759
basically City Council limits Colorado

499
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,500
Springs now and all of El Paso County on

500
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,420
a twelve plan count limit no matter what

501
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,279
so even if you have a medical marijuana

502
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:58,680
card from a doctor is that up hold the

503
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,599
bowl in court oh it will if you go to if

504
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:06,299
you go up to like Denver quarters that's

505
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:09,539
to the first cat that's my rag no she's

506
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:12,389
really nice you guys will hear a cat and

507
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,190
dogs on this show pass through County

508
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,509
you loosen the odors in the Colorado

509
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,130
Springs if you get busting collar

510
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,410
Springs you lose in Colorado Springs you

511
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,000
lose in El Paso County until you got to

512
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,890
go up to Denver that's when you go to

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,569
Denver you win right then you've already

514
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,620
spent your life savings right and

515
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:27,389
they've already taken everything away

516
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,399
from you okay do they take it down when

517
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:36,210
they bust you now I don't know or they

518
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:38,160
let you go through court before really

519
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,019
when they I heard them start doing raids

520
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,750
I just pretty much cut everything down

521
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:48,509
I'm like okay rooms done family well

522
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:50,190
yeah I used to smoke you saw me smoke

523
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:58,710
tonight I'll smoke you know eight grams

524
00:21:50,190 --> 00:22:00,059
right and that's that we this podcast it

525
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,700
wouldn't be a surprise to smoke eight

526
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,700
grams in an episode when one day at all

527
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:12,420
maybe maybe maybe two and a half grams a

528
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,920
day just to not run out so we started

529
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,960
this so my buddy called me because he

530
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,880
knew I was frustrated things like man

531
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,440
you gotta call this other guy he's like

532
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,830
he will tell you how to do it and get

533
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,370
into the industry where you can be legit

534
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:27,990
a hundred percent and you can operate to

535
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,089
where you can still help veterans you

536
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,180
can help them in a way where you

537
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:34,109
couldn't do it before which was I can

538
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,200
recuperate the cost

539
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:43,439
through my labor right so I can do that

540
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:50,610
and then also now I can re what's what's

541
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:53,190
the word I would say I can like so

542
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:56,308
basically I can resupply the VFA with

543
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,830
free cannabis okay nations from the CVC

544
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,569
right so now we're all in house see

545
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:02,129
where this is going okay so now we're

546
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,319
keeping everything in house it's all

547
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,669
quality controlled we know exactly who

548
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,178
grew it where it's coming from

549
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:14,309
is the the CVC going to be regulated by

550
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:17,548
the Colorado amed No okay so what we're

551
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:21,599
looking for is basically it's a place

552
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:24,058
where we basically have a warehouse for

553
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,250
your six plants because a lot of people

554
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,500
you know cannot grow their plants

555
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,839
whether they can and just can't in their

556
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,220
living space or they don't have the

557
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,928
green thumb to do so or so are the time

558
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,019
we are gonna provide a place for their

559
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:42,538
six plants and we'll take care of it for

560
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,099
them and it's just like babysitting them

561
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:49,048
and have it giving them place to grow

562
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:50,668
and then we will return their product to

563
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:53,099
them and all they have to do is

564
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:56,340
reimburse us for you know our time and

565
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,959
our costs and through that we'll be able

566
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,428
to help a lot of people that would

567
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,120
normally have to go to another

568
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:04,440
recreation or get it or to get a red

569
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,839
card we don't do that we operate

570
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,880
according to a minute sixty-four okay

571
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,428
we're not operating in any greater worse

572
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,250
what amendment 64 says is what we're

573
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:17,038
doing and for that we're we're not

574
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,490
sketchy at all in amendment 64 what it

575
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,950
says specifically is it lists out you

576
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,220
know personal uses of marijuana you can

577
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:29,250
grow you can store you can consume all

578
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,730
of these things and in the last section

579
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:36,419
in that part of the amendment it says

580
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,700
that anyone in a Colorado can assist you

581
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,250
with any of the things in this personal

582
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,470
usage category so therefore you can have

583
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,028
somebody babysitting your plants for you

584
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,829
because they are allowed to assist you

585
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:49,489
and grow it

586
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:53,898
okay we love and we love what we do so

587
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:56,119
Steve put his mic down for a minute we

588
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:57,498
do so why not do this and this is a way

589
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:58,759
for us to be able to provide a service

590
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:01,850
that normally wouldn't be able to be

591
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,499
provided right and now you know with

592
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,898
this service being the way it's going to

593
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:07,339
be set up is now we can take in people

594
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:09,199
like we're gonna take in five interns

595
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,849
start at the beginning of the year for

596
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,190
entire year we're going to train five

597
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:14,778
veterans up to get into the industry to

598
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,210
learn how the process works through the

599
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:19,759
meed buy their licenses to get into the

600
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,009
meed get all that paperwork done so when

601
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,548
they're done after that year we bring in

602
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:27,858
master growers like you or your boss or

603
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:29,599
other bosses from different dispensaries

604
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:31,368
and they get to see stats and paperwork

605
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,009
on these guys how consistent they were

606
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:36,079
what they're testing what the tests were

607
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:39,079
on their on their cannabis was and and

608
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,509
basically you get to cherry-pick and you

609
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,278
get to figure out who's gonna be your

610
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:46,009
new grower and do you eat the hire them

611
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,739
on the spot so you're making kind of a

612
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,278
master grower farm League right that's

613
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:53,358
awesome

614
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:55,308
yeah like it these guys I mean a lot of

615
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:57,739
these guys need a job or something to do

616
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:59,778
and we can train them as best we can and

617
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:03,679
get them into his positions to keep them

618
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:05,839
busy and in that way we're helping the

619
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,419
community even more and they'll get to

620
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,738
grow the plots for the veterans that are

621
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,989
giving you their plant counts right

622
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:13,970
absolutely and then you guys are gonna

623
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,798
train them right they're gonna trust you

624

00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:20,628
to us we're gonna just take them down

627
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:23,058
the line this is what we do this is how

628
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:25,819
we do it this is why we do it and and

629

630
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:29,868
book and this is why no this is why we

631
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,639
do it from personal experience here's

632
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,959
the book for reference you know like

633
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:35,089
teeming with microbes teeming with

634
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,450
nutrients those are good books for these

635

637
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,259
mean if you if you're gonna do it like

638
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,388
that I mean that's great but I'd rather

639
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:49,548
read something that's 200 pages and

640
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:51,378
where you got to look up [ __ ] and it's

like oh wow that's really amazing like

642
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:54,138
you're actually learning it's

643
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,298
retroactive instead of comprehensive

644
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:57,429
instead of an encyclopedia this is why

645
00:26:56,298 --> 00:27:02,440
it's green

646
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:04,240
hey because it works be because you I

647
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,769
mean it's like come on I mean no a lot

648
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,299
of growing knowledge is just your

649
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:10,900
experience so we're giving these guys

650
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:13,180
experience and knowledge for free and

651
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,100
eventually a job hopefully out of it

652
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,090
that's pretty red right so maybe one day

653
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,159
across Colorado

654
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:20,259
there'll be veterans running these grows

655
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,430
or across the nation that's the whole

656
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:26,170
point once we go federal we're really

657
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,000
we're really just gonna blow up with it

658
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,100
because now we're gonna be the only

659
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,529
training facility in the United States

660
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:34,329
that can train people and then send them

661
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,309
out anywhere in the United States after

662
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:49,629
one year the dogs make the blood smell

663
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:51,909
great a bunch of Sun just they can just

664
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,530
take control of the industry because

665
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,960
they're some of the most disciplined

666
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:57,819
hard-working I've been through three

667
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,350
people in the girl facility so far that

668
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,179
I have have not made the cut I think

669
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:03,669
some veterans might be the next on the

670
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,740
shopping list they just want to work

671
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,250
they need a price you get better purpose

672
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:11,950
he'll go along with you he's loyal he

673
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:16,029
just he wants he wants to to be a part

674
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:18,519
of something right great I like it is

675
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:20,139
there somebody on your guys's team that

676
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,819
knows how to build a good commercial

677
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,490
size grow to keep everything that you're

678
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:26,079
trying to do sustainable I would say

679
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:34,089
between John and I we have it covered

680
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:35,649
I was just auditioning is all whatever

681
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:42,549
already on the land that you buy that's

682
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:44,350
right I can make holes waiting on his

683
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:46,869
wife got cancer you have the land we

684
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:49,000
need a building for this collective and

685
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:51,639
that's going that's going up here pretty

686
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,440
soon though so right an engineer

687
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,200
security come out surveying land we're

688
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,850
already ready to go like dump the

689
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,960
concrete tomorrow

690
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:03,939
yeah facility up within what six weeks

691
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,009
after that you can and I've been working

692
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,230
with kavita's for a while in this whole

693
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,750
last year I've been focusing on grow

694
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,779
room too

695
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:15,200
and you know maximizing yields through

696
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:17,799
that so I think that after a year of

697
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,269
focusing on that we can create the

698
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,879
create the grow that we need to be able

699
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:25,279
to provide medicine for these guys at

700
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,010
the cheapest cost possible it's good to

701
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,259
see the owners and founders and CEOs of

702
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:31,549
agro be the people that are gonna be in

703
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,849
there getting their hands dirty because

704
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:37,129
too often in the regulated industry

705
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:38,449
there are guys that own big businesses

706
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,130
they just want to make more money and

707
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,080
they buy into the cannabis industry and

708
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:46,730
then the growers are forced to just they

709
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,159
have to face conditions and do things

710
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,380
that they have to compromise their

711
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,610
integrity and a grow often right because

712
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,170
the owner doesn't want to spend the

713
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,669
extra money to do it the way it should

714
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,500
be so it's good to see and I'm not

715
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:03,080
calling anybody out my facility they I

716
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:05,119
write a shopping list and it shows up I

717
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,559
write down a shopping list and take a

718
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,059
picture of it and send it to him and

719
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,190
then the next day when he comes in all

720
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,720
that [ __ ] shows up he's like you don't

721
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,200
need to be shopping and doing [ __ ] like

722
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,549
that you need to be growing cannabis for

723
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,720

729
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:33,560

hating potheads like they made fun of me

733

735
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,690
paycheck and then I go home and enjoy it

736
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:52,430

813
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,929
so so basically to to keep our costs low

814
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,760
for the CBC so that yeah to keep our

815
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,260
costs low I'm gonna pass this over to

816
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,419
John because he's gonna read off some of

817
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,750
the main sponsors that are helped us for

818
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,279
the CBC and these are for the CBC to get

819
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,679
you guys started with your facility in

820
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,769
the mill in the land okay so from these

821
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,470
guys our first sponsor and the one that

822
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:46,679
makes this incredibly possible for us to

823
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:49,678
do and cheap for the veterans is nectar

824
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,470
for the gods Steve has been growing with

825
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,730
nectar for the gods for few years yeah

826
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:57,539
like two years now

827
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,469
and he's gotten to known the owner

828
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,279
really well

829
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:04,230
Scott asteroid yes and he's been

830
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,350
sponsored for a while by them so we went

831
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,119
to him with this idea that we had and

832
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:10,589
Steve emailed him or Facebook to him and

833
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,019
asked if he would continue the

834
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:16,170
sponsorship and he agreed with it

835
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:18,329
and so we are getting our nutrients and

836
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,849
soil for free which helps us keep the

837
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:23,069
cost down for the veterans the

838
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:25,108
reimbursement fee is planned to be at

839
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:28,320
$100 at first and remember this is

840
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:30,449
recreational at $100 first and every

841
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,630
sponsorship we get we can take that

842
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:36,569
chunk out our goal is $50 reimbursement

843
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,220
because as our cost drops so do the

844
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,470
prices because that's what we're doing

845
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,819
I knew we're nothing to get open I do

846
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:44,989
hear fireworks those are fireworks

847
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:51,080
if we were at my house there would be

848
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:53,179
question our old house as well I thought

849
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,190
webelo was bad Colorado Springs is

850
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:57,559
getting there oh I've had some

851
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,000
interesting neighbors all right and

852
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,570
let's see what else we got some seat

853
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,179
sponsors we got gonzo seeds uh giving us

854
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:07,849
this genetics we need obviously we've

855
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:10,909
been on talk radio on Monday they

856
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,410
enjoyed our time up there and we will

857
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:15,460
probably be going back those guys are

858
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:18,588
really awesome they're going to have our

859
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:21,949
commercials run on their radio show cool

860
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:24,108
we got pollination Steve knows Ryan

861
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:25,759
really well and they're they have some

862
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:27,739
killer strains and so they're going to

863
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,820
be sending us some of their genetics to

864
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:34,399
work with cb1 analytics Steve got in

865
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,619
contact with those guys and Nate Tuesday

866
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,349
and they're gonna be running all of our

867
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,150
all of our testing for us for free as

868
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,099
well so we can know exactly what we're

869
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,420
giving these guys very cool you guys

870
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,710
will have some Irish genetics in that

871
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:51,349
garden of course we will

872
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:52,909
guaranteed I've got some high yielding

873
00:36:51,349 --> 00:37:00,200
stuff that you guys will appreciate oh

874
00:36:52,909 --> 00:37:02,118
yeah we love this we have so far but

875
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,639
even with just those we're able to keep

876
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,800
the cost down as best we can

877
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,319
everything else we can add on there

878
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,930
we'll just be cutting off and making it

879
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,490
cheaper for these guys yep every time we

880
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,079
can chop at that price to bring it down

881
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:17,059
just a better advantage for these guys

882
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,380
so if I were a veteran and I sign my

883
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,269
plants over to you and then I wait

884
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,650
probably 60 or 90 days so that you could

885
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:24,019
pull my plants down and get a harvest

886
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,720
out of them for a hundred dollars to

887
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:30,619
start what realistically what amount of

888
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,088
medicine can I expect from you yes it

889
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:35,059
depends on the size of the plants we

890
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:38,900
grow but I'm thinking three gallons

891
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:40,489
three to five gallon plants okay and six

892
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,000
of them because that's your legal well

893
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:45,139
3/3 and flour three three plants okay

894
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,710
that makes more sense

895
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:48,929
okay and

896
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,818
and we'll keep it on a pretty nice

897
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:53,728
rotation for everyone everything will be

898
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:55,228
numbered by patient and everything like

899
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:58,318
that so we'll be able to keep it

900
00:37:55,228 --> 00:38:00,718
constant and of course you know the

901
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,268
better we grow the more will come out of

902
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,420
each plant and so eventually they'll be

903
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:09,088
getting potentially more that then they

904
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,838
can actually consume and at that point

905
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:14,460
there they can waive their cost and give

906
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:16,018
their product back to us and that's

907
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:21,298
where we're gonna be able to start

908
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:22,558
giving away free product through like

909
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:24,150
that chain of command that's working

910
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,479
really well for you yeah there's no

911
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,579
loose ends where money or anything just

912
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:32,939
sits around we're always just trying to

913
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,650
give back as good as fast as we can well

914
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,999
it's like you know City Council when

915
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,979
they did the whole 12 point count it

916
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:39,808
really just broke me you know it was

917
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:41,248
just I was really upset I was like man

918
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:42,869
there's got to be a way around this and

919
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:44,639
that was such a ridiculous way to do it

920
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:45,778
because nobody at that meeting oh we've

921
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,719
been over this nobody at that meeting

922
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:50,518
wanted that to go through no no one not

923
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,278
not one person there was four people

924
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:57,328
that wanted to go through plus the the

925
00:38:53,278 --> 00:39:00,139
the City Council members and about 150

926
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:02,640
to 200 that were opposed to that there's

927
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:04,978
so many people there I watched that on

928
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,469
the internet and you couldn't even feel

929
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:09,989
the vibe of the room coming from the

930
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,249
computer screens as well I live in

931
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,409
another city and I was still paying

932
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:16,889
attention because had me rallied was

933
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:20,848
four hours of testimony it was 13

934
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:21,509
minutes I saw Andrea's part yeah that

935
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:25,499
was intense

936
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:27,150
that was great there was another bill

937
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:30,808
coming up that you wanted to talk about

938
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:33,660
right so apparently somebody's gathered

939
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,609
enough signatures to possibly add this

940
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:39,058
to the ballot for this year and it's to

941
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:40,978
limit the percentage of THC in every

942
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,640
single product whether it's medical or

943
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:47,518
recreational that's 16 percent 16

944
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,978
percent THC in anything everything so

945
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:53,248
the concentrate flower yeah

946
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:55,048
I'm flabbergasted right well how I would

947
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:58,089
have to get rid of every flower in my

948
00:39:55,048 --> 00:40:00,009
garden or cut it down at week five right

949
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:06,870
who the hell wants to smoke week five we

950
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:16,710
that doesn't even this slab of shatter

951
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:18,940
could only test at 16 16 percent THC but

952
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,960
okay well I'm pretty sure you're correct

953
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,980
with the flower that's I mean if it's

954
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,809
from what I heard last night it was

955
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,119
everything and if that's the point

956
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:29,590
whether it's recreational or medical who

957
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,559
tells that gonna benefit it's no longer

958
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,880
medical right it's gonna destroy

959
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:39,570
dispensaries it's gonna destroy everyone

960
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,570
I mean gift is throw it away

961
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:48,099
that's just man that's just wrong such a

962
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,570
waste i I I'm not a quitter but if you

963
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:52,299
told me that I couldn't grow cannabis

964
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,850
over 16 percent THC anymore I might quit

965
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,080
well I'd move yeah yeah I just have to

966
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:58,299
move the operation somewhere else

967
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,860
there's no way to really I mean terpenes

968
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,830
are great but they only take I mean in

969
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:05,260
in in th he's great but there's the

970
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:08,049
combination of both Eve in in high forms

971
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,820
that are just truly beneficial perfect

972
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,250
medicine right they're missing either

973
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,890
one and it's just gonna be you know

974
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:18,130
synthesized THC or it's gonna be some

975
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:23,400
blah blah blah you know turkey the

976
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:25,720
reasoning behind this idea yeah Wow

977
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,269
somebody trying to control the industry

978
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,579
that can't go that's you know what I

979
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:32,259
think it is I think I think they make so

980
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,420
much money in the black market like

981
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,640
busting people in the black market that

982
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,200
they're trying to revert it back a

983
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,839
little bit so they can just keep going

984
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,000
after and just keep yelling that each

985
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,650
nail into the coffin just to make it

986
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,349
worse to make us criminals again I'm

987
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,389
kind of like flabbergasted like you gave

988
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:57,489
us this and now you want to take it away

989
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:59,469
and they like what the government's been

990
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:01,869
lately it's like here take this no just

991
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:04,239
kidding it's like come on we just made

992
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:07,869
it illegal in a different twist the law

993
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,609
you can't grow at home because you are

994
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,349
just gonna cause problems and now you

995
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,960
can't buy good weed at dispensaries so

996
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:13,309
go home and grow

997
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,240
you're good weed oh you can't do that

998
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:19,849
yeah no no no yeah we drink and pop all

999
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,699
your pills and I just hate to go back to

1000
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:25,940
all that but it's like come on man right

1001
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:27,469
how many people do you see when you're

1002
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,059
out in Colorado Springs how many people

1003
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:30,319
do you see that are just too high for

1004
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:33,858
their own good on cannabis that are

1005
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,050
causing a problem a lot of meth heads

1006
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:37,909
that's I wasn't trying to go there but

1007
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,589
how many people do you see on a bicycle

1008
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:41,029
as soon as the Sun Goes Down with the

1009
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:42,980
[ __ ] headlamp on their forehead

1010
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,230
picking it ass or driving around peeking

1011
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,280
in every trash can

1012
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,659
everywhere you got to dodge them on your

1013
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:59,930
car right now cuz you know if there's

1014
00:42:47,659 --> 00:43:01,879
some way they're like and the ones that

1015
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:03,889
are the problem are less than 1% but

1016
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,880
they're going after them and then

1017
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:10,118
punishing the rest of us that wasn't

1018
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,900
even part of the crew that we would have

1019
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,369
punished him anyway if we don't we don't

1020
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,230
want that in our community we want to be

1021
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,000
able to support our community and be

1022
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,469
able to show people that we're in this

1023
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,650
for the good reasons this isn't the

1024
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:27,649
black market this is this we just need

1025
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,410
to get rid of just all these regulations

1026
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,200
just trying to tie us down I mean yeah

1027
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:34,730
there's there's too many plants in a

1028
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,799
house I mean if it's too powerful for

1029
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,139
the grid it'll burn the grid up I get

1030
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,080
that you'll get a house fire so whatever

1031
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:44,299
on that but there's people that need 40

1032
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,299
50 60 plants and that's perfectly

1033
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,800
acceptable in a home yeah and you can do

1034
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,300
that safely and there's no reason you

1035
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,460
can't I mean especially with kids that

1036
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,950
like parents said there was one li that

1037
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,190
has 19 different strains for her child

1038
00:43:54,949 --> 00:44:00,019
and it works and she can't she loses

1039
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,588
those strains it's like she's screwed

1040
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:05,420
and that's the kid that kid needs that

1041
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:07,400
and I mean it's it's pretty powerful to

1042
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,559
be able to provide something like that

1043
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,440
for a child in your own home and then

1044
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,659
somebody tries to say no it's like [ __ ]

1045
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,170
you you can't do that go to the store

1046
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:20,149
right yeah yeah it doesn't work the same

1047
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,750
it's missing [ __ ] that's mass-produced

1048
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,750
it's like

1049
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,008
yeah for the price of I don't exactly

1050
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,509
know what a gram cost to produce at home

1051
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:31,548
I've done math and it's come out

1052
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:33,440
somewhere between 50 cents and 2 bucks a

1053
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:34,880
gram I think to produce cannabis at home

1054
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,559
just a fan what kind of nutrients and

1055
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,509
what your electrical happens to be where

1056
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,579
you are yeah I've heard as low as 30

1057
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:43,818
cents a gram what dispensary can you

1058
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:45,650
find anything for 30 cents I'm probably

1059
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:47,630
cheaper and then at my house 10 or 12

1060
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:51,079
dollars a gram at a dispensary minimum

1061
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:53,329
plus taxes plus getting there right plus

1062
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,950
look at recreational tax too and who

1063
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:56,329
knows what was sprayed on it who knows

1064
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:58,848
what kind of nutrients it was growing

1065
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:03,230
with I mean just everything tested for

1066
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:04,490
fur was a pirate-themed I believe so all

1067
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,829
of the recreational products are

1068
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:08,209
currently tested July 1st was supposed

1069
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,528
to be the day I was gonna do another

1070
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,179
show about this bulbs talk about it now

1071
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:12,739
July 1st was supposed to be the date

1072
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:14,419
when all of the medical products were

1073
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:15,768
tested but they've pushed it back to

1074
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,509
later in the year it's gonna be closer

1075
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:26,108
to September or October before they're

1076
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:28,309
able to test everything facilities

1077
00:45:26,108 --> 00:45:29,509
they're just gonna be pound sitting

1078
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,710
there and all the shelves are gonna go

1079
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,869
bare because nobody can test the

1080
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,730
products see the it's like why are we

1081
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:37,789
focusing on that why are we going after

1082
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,139
less than 1% and punishing everybody

1083
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:40,970
else when we could be going about the

1084
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:43,308
regulation just setting the standard and

1085
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:47,538
making a good presentation for the rest

1086
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:49,880
of the unit you know if we had eight or

1087
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:51,440
twelve good solid standardized testing

1088
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,480
facilities that were bringing in an

1089
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,309
excise tax every time that product got

1090
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,409
tested do you think they would replace

1091
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:05,359
the revenues that they're making off of

1092
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:07,338
busting petty weed crimes we just need

1093
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,440
some sort of operation people will see

1094
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:12,440
it they will start to accept it it just

1095
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,389
takes time you know there's like my wife

1096
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,909
three and a half four years ago she was

1097
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:19,489
like no no weed in my house I think I'm

1098
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:21,528
like wow yeah and now it's she's like

1099
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:27,409
well this you know it works she bleeds

1100
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:29,869
in she hates the smell you know she

1101
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:31,759
she's actually allergic to it she tries

1102
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:34,990
really hard to like it and she does a

1103
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:38,269
good job she does she's a good supporter

1104
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:39,709
well it's just saved me yeah Duggan you

1105
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:44,750
probably should probably work

1106
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:48,500
relationship right I mean saved our

1107
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:50,960
money I mean I've been able to go

1108
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,610
shopping again and and get food on the

1109
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,470
table again once I started growing for

1110
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,870
myself it was like wow I wasn't spending

1111
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:59,689
twenty seven hundred three thousand

1112
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:01,940
dollars a month dispensary right it was

1113
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:13,070
bad how many prescriptions were you able

1114
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:15,650
to eliminate using cannabis 24 different

1115
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:19,130
prescriptions you can do like with

1116
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,869
cannabis and if you were gonna if you're

1117
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,980
having a shitty week and you're not

1118
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,269
feeling your best you need extra

1119
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:28,969
medicine how much you're gonna smoke in

1120
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:29,269
a whole week now this week maybe an

1121
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:32,209
ounce

1122
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:33,769
okay so somewhere between 150 and 200

1123
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,260
bucks worth of quality cannabis but if

1124
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:40,190
you grew it yourself we're looking at 28

1125
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:42,320
grams maybe 28 bucks worth maybe $10 $10

1126
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,420
worth it okay everything's pretty much

1127
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,850
sponsored for me so the nutrients are

1128
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,220
paid for and you get the see I pay water

1129
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:51,349
and lights okay and your energy I mean

1130
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:54,289
your effort yeah well yeah but I don't

1131
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:56,569
really yes know what I include okay but

1132
00:47:54,289 --> 00:48:01,940
that's it so I mean it's to me that's

1133
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:10,190
like nothing the growing of it is

1134
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:12,679
therapeutic for you also it's just

1135
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,840
details here and there shows you every

1136
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,759
single plan it's definitely part of the

1137
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,260
healing process and that's another

1138
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,120
reason why we want to bring these guys

1139
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,190
in cuz it will work for other people I

1140
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,920
know I feel calm in my garden me too I

1141
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,599
could be happy I have to drive 55 miles

1142
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,000
from my house to the office every day

1143
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,239
and the last 10 miles of that drive is

1144
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,010
like bumper-to-bumper madness I could

1145
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,939
probably park my car run up to the guy

1146
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,830
in front me and punch him in the face

1147
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:44,409
six times and get back in my car before

1148
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:44,409
traffic get in the grow is just like yes

1149
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,389
Oxygen's a bunch of fans and it's 74

1150
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:56,469
degrees and i'm happy i like that

1151
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:58,538
temperature yeah yes I love to get it

1152
00:48:56,469 --> 00:49:00,939
done in like 72 in last two and a half

1153
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:02,680
weeks okay if I wasn't running a big

1154
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,119
Perpetual I would do things a little bit

1155
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:06,460
differently but with the perpetual you

1156
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,740
have to keep it ideal across the board

1157
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,539
because I've got there are plants three

1158
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:12,489
every three weeks or new plants going in

1159
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:15,579
so I've got stuff at week one week 3 and

1160
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:20,439
week six nine six and three so I have to

1161
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:23,200
have 12 12 and 74° 12 yeah yeah well

1162
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,200
I've been playing with with flight

1163
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,679
manipulation lately and more I like did

1164
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:32,169
it 35 days of flipped into 11 13 did the

1165
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:35,379
last one at 15 days and then I did want

1166
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:38,500
to just straight 11 13 I'm gonna see how

1167
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,210
if anything any flavor changes or

1168
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,940
anything's enhanced or anything what I

1169
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,730
noticed from the 11 13 was when I was

1170
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,588
doing Fino hunts I would see much more

1171
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,269
Fino typical expression with the

1172
00:49:47,588 --> 00:49:51,369
extended dark period I would see much

1173
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:53,440
more variation from different phenotypes

1174
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:55,028
so for a breeder that was really handy

1175
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,338
what I did notice was it kind of

1176
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:59,108
diminished on my harvest weight really

1177
00:49:57,338 --> 00:50:01,058
wasn't where it should be seemed to

1178
00:49:59,108 --> 00:50:03,880
finish a little quicker to finish

1179
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:05,380
quicker absolutely yeah yeah I've

1180
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:14,619
actually gotten a bump and weight from

1181
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:17,289
switching over to has been huge for me I

1182
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:19,480
love that that product it has made some

1183
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:22,750
of the densest stickiest nose I've ever

1184
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,608
had is it a media proved can we use it

1185
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,139
in the meed grows I don't see why you

1186
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:28,088
couldn't okay a lot of products are

1187
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:32,278
banned a lot of [ __ ] is banned right

1188
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:34,480
it's a microbial inoculant I'm not sure

1189
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:36,579
compare it to the other things that I

1190
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,130
use I can't talk about one of the

1191
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:42,190
products that I use secrets

1192
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:44,890
yeah dietary thing but we also use the

1193
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,298
veg bloom plus life it's all compared to

1194
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:47,949
that and see if it's got the same stuff

1195
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:52,269
in there you don't pee on your plants do

1196
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:53,980
know what did you say that actually told

1197
00:50:52,269 --> 00:51:19,989
people to pee in their plants

1198
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:21,809
let's expand travel even wanna think

1199
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:24,459
about that

1200
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:26,619
mammoth microbes big shot Steve's gotta

1201
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,090
go refill this water and we've been gone

1202
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:29,680
for almost an hour you guys you're

1203
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,019
talking to folks a lot you're already

1204
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,358
going for a while before - just talking

1205
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:36,159
about we had to spend 30 minutes get my

1206
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,389
sd card fix because for some reason it

1207
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,069
didn't want to work when I showed up to

1208
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:41,019
record which was almost embarrassing but

1209
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:46,269
we pulled it off electronics man that

1210
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:48,190
just happens didn't work all right I

1211
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,719
feel like since Steve left we're all

1212
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,099
stuck at a low cuz he's got a notebook

1213
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:54,459
over there and he was kind of running

1214
00:51:51,099 --> 00:52:02,409
the show he's definitely a talker he's a

1215
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:07,030
people person we're gonna grow soil

1216
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:08,649
hydro cocoa the nectar number eight soil

1217
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:13,300
is the one we like we add a little extra

1218
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:16,240
perlite and it's a cocoa based and their

1219
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,880
whole line is just or although organic

1220
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,699
things I would use in my soil but in

1221
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,000
bottles and pH D low so that it doesn't

1222
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:26,858
go bad and stuff and that stuff works

1223
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,179
great half the time me and Steve can't

1224
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:29,858
even tell the difference between our

1225
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:32,799
weed sweet they have like different

1226
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:34,449
overtones and stuff but I'm very

1227
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,730
impressed with the nectar freely with

1228
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:39,879
God's line and more organics guy I don't

1229
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:41,409
like any lines really I understand that

1230
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,420
I have a friend named Sean who's been on

1231
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:45,549
the podcast a lot of times who doesn't

1232
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,409
use any bottles nothing he's using comes

1233
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,390
from a bottle that's where I am his

1234
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:50,949
product is definitely you can tell that

1235
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:52,509
it's a different product it's cleaner it

1236
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:55,230
burns better though ashes are as white

1237
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:58,060
as this parchment paper fish bone meal

1238
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,079
about fish he's got the fish bone meal

1239
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:01,389
bottle

1240
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,219
it's just fish bone meal it into water

1241
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:05,769
and I [ __ ] love it yeah that stuff's

1242
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:06,969
awesome yeah Steve got me inspired he

1243
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,489
went got a beverage I'm reaching for one

00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:15,440
here oh no it's a frosty cold doctor

1248
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:17,118
look at you you came prepared

1249
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:24,619
you gotta come prepared to the podcast

1250
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:27,950
we have no idea where you're going the

1251
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:29,950
dog on the podcast right got anything to

1252
00:53:27,949 --> 00:53:35,569
say dog

1253
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:37,279
speak to the dog like cannabis oh yeah

1254
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:39,710
it's been trimmed cycle and we just give

1255
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,690
the dogs the leaves the families you

1256
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,579
know they're not getting high off of it

1257
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,710
or anything but those vitamins and so

1258
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:48,170
you know it's good phytonutrients and

1259
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,970
it's so funny they eat the leaves off

1260
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,980
and leave the stem and they'll nibble

1261
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:54,199
around the stem and they're just like oh

1262
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,329
we don't want that oh yeah they'll clean

1263
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:58,579
our floors afterwards they're hilarious

1264
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:01,699

1268
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:18,289
fall black ones and breeding dogs was an

1269
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:53,689
experience I like because it's much

1270
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:55,340
easier to get rid of this podcast I was

1271

cannabis may be legal in Colorado but

1297
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:16,570
there's no legal place to consume it

1298
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,570
other than your house that's correct

1299
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:22,610
it's stupid isn't it you can smoke it

1300
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,190
somewhere here in the springs we have

1301
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:27,740
great open parks where people love to go

1302
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,000
and smoke down but you know if this for

1303
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:30,229
some reason there's a cop up there

1304
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,610
they'll get in trouble and I don't

1305
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:36,349

1314
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,849

1316
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:02,119

1319
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,829
time to have a weed talk we've talked

1320
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:08,869
about weed a lot of times she doesn't

1321
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:13,819
care she's oh my god dad that weed

1322
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:17,210

1323
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:18,860
four it was like okay look I want to

1324
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,260
educate you on this she knows not to

1325
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,660
touch it not to get close to it she

1326
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,880
stays completely away from it you know

1327
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:27,409
she just know she's been educated she

1328
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,140
has no desire for it she knows it's

1329
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:32,210
medicine it's not oh it's fun it's not

1330
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:33,559
like that it's like it's medicine but I

1331
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,599
don't I just I just

1332
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,179
want anybody to have to have the talk

1333
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,309

1334
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:42,889
that doing over there dad he's doing

1335
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:44,389
drugs like it's just gonna go down I

1336
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:46,489
just don't want to do that to our scene

1337
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:48,019
we should respect those parks a little

1338
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:52,729
better right and I'm a hypocrite cuz I

1339
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:54,769
took a DAB at the park the other day and

1340
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:56,240
I live an hour away from here and my

1341
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,889
friend was nice enough to bring me lunch

1342
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,299
and I thought she deserves some dabs for

1343
00:57:57,889 --> 00:58:01,400
bringing me lunch so I was like well

1344
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,930
let's go to that park right there yes

1345
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,789
that's why we need our dab lounges

1346
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:09,949
around in the spring set note to those

1347
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:11,480
to one of my favorite places to ever go

1348
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:12,949
in Springs was to go hang out at the can

1349
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,110
of Canyon yeah that's the first time

1350
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:16,819
Steven I'm at meals according to podcast

1351
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:18,789
at the canyon posted that I was there he

1352
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,590
showed up and brought weed for me to try

1353
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:23,960
it's truly regulated like alcohol we

1354
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,880
should be able to consume in a public

1355
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,179
place like a bar that's the most valid

1356
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,680
argument out of all of it you tried to

1357
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:32,119
keep the officials the legislation is

1358
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:33,529
the one that made it regulated that was

1359
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,569
their idea regulated like alcohol

1360
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,400
there's an alcohol drinking

1361
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,690
establishment on every two blocks if

1362
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,960
you're a bubble there's one every 30

1363
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:44,090
feet right it's terrible oh so many

1364
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,340
drinking places and nowhere illegal to

1365
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,019
consume zipper in your house in your

1366
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,940
house and that's if you have permission

1367
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:51,980
from your landlord if your rent and how

1368
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:54,710

1369
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,539
lunch break if I don't live here right

1370
00:58:54,710 --> 00:59:00,130

1371
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:00,130
