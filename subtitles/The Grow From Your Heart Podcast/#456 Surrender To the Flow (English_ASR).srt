lemon I would absolutely agree with all

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,939
of those flavors there is certainly a

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,859
pie ninis on the inhale there's a

18
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,509
sourness on the exhale and the lemon

19
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,719
kind of lingers on the tongue there's

20
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,058
also a very gassy aroma the lingers in

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,010
the room when you smoke the sour double

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:01:00,718
the potency label says that this product

23

58
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:26,068
to me that support keeps this podcast

59
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:27,929
free for everybody I've put out over 450

60
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,268
episodes I've never charged a penny for

61
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,819
any of my content the patreon is what

62
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,219
allows me to produce free content that

63
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,109
patreon covers the cost of my computer

64
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,579
that patreon covers the cost of my

65
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,379
internet connection every month my

66
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,299
internet connection is expensive here

67
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,919
that patreon covers things like

68
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,810
microphone covers so that when Mike

69
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,039
comes over him and whatever guest has

70
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,479
been over before they don't have to

71
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,400
share the same microphone cover because

72
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,108
that's a little bit funky it goes for

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,579
things like that so big shout out to

74
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:56,280

75
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,379
patreon thank you I appreciate it and it

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,780
makes the show possible I feel like I

77
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,489
just did an NPR sales drive or something

78
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,009
ladies and gentlemen without your

79
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,959
donations NPR wouldn't be here it's not

80
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,699
like that you guys without the patreon I

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,689
would still do the podcast I just want

82
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,939

83

the show maybe you've just got something

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,060
you'd like to say you can send me an

168
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,549
email my email address is grow from your

169
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,350
heart at hotmail.com I would love to

170
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,389
hear from you let's jump right into this

171
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,550
first email this is from someone who

172
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,529
calls themselves st. Stephen hey brother

173
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,780
good to hear from you the email from our

174
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:24,899
friends st. Stephen goes just like this

175
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,239
hey Rasta Jeff first off I have

176
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,399
purchased two humidity and temperature

177
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,139
monitors they are both giving me wildly

178
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,609
different readings

179
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,259
I would like my information about

180
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,449
temperature and humidity to be as

181
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,240
accurate as possible both inside and

182
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,490
outside my tents are there any

183
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,379
temperature and humidity monitors

184
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,478
which you would recommend there are a

185
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,009
couple I will recommend but before we

186
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,318
get there I am kind of curious about

187
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,110
your experiment that you have done here

188
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,090
you bought to temperature and humidity

189
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,650
monitors those are hygrometers I think

190
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,359
we call those and they were giving you

191
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,848
wildly different readings I want to know

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,580
if you bought two of the same kind are

193
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:04,800
they the same thing did you buy two

194
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,839
different hygrometers did you buy one at

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,939
one time and wanted another is one

196
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,348
battery operated as one I don't know

197
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,360
what the other one works is the battery

198
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,610
dead on one is what I'm getting at so

199
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,250
are they the same kind are they the same

200
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,949
quality then my next question is are

201
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,430
they in the same place how far apart are

202
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,900
they in your area it is very common in a

203
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,509
gross space to have wildly different

204
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,638
readings just a few feet apart from each

205
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,439
other in a grow environment imagine if

206
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,329
I'm up here by the light six or eight

207
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,639
feet up high in the room and I come down

208
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,008
just directly straight down go three

209
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,228
feet down it's going to be drastically

210
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,389
cooler just a few feet down if we don't

211
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:43,918
have appropriate air flow then imagine

212
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,810
if you move off three feet to the left

213
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,639
it's gonna get much cooler so you're

214
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,319
going to get drastically different

215
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,750
readings throughout the room possibly

216
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,490
you may have microclimates based on the

217
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,129
size of the room you may have 90 degrees

218
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,990
sections and 78 degree sections based on

219
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,360
the size of the room and the efficiency

220
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,889
of your air flow equipment so my first

221
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,930
investigation is what kind of

222
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,269
hygrometers are we using are they the

223
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,228
same thing are they the same quality

224
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,819
because if we're using different

225
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:10,859
monitors and we're getting different

226
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,779
results that experiment is a little bit

227
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,729
invalid we need three of the same or at

228
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,619
least two of the same tools to do the

229
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,379
same experiment to expect similar

230
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,360
results if you're using the same kind

231
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,718
this may sound crazy but I would suggest

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,870
buying a third and compare that third to

233
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:30,240
those to maybe get a more expensive

234
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,620
model that's what you came to me for

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,719
you're asking if there is something that

236
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,538
I would recommend of course I would

237
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,640
recommend APO grow unit they are very

238
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,799
great monitors they monitor your

239
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,389
temperature your humidity you can water

240
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,769
the temperature of your nutrient

241
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,389
solution if you have got a reservoir

242
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,649
with water in there there's a little

243
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,409
probe that just measures that

244
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,809
temperature at all times it will do the

245
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,669
calculations on your VPD for you so you

246
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,549
know what your vapor pressure deficit is

247
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,769
in the room

248
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:58,778
or the monitor is hung at all times they

249
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,879
are quite affordable they are not

250
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:02,950
expensive units at all they're very easy

251
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,169
to get a hold of what I really like

252
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,120
about the pol grow unit is I can look at

253
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,159
it on my phone all I have to do is open

254
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
my phone go to a website I've already

255
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,958
got the tab saving my favorites says pol

256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,730
grow click on there once I man it just

257
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,619
takes a couple of seconds to refresh the

258
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,870
dashboard and that shows me the

259
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,659
temperature and the humidity in my room

260
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,190
I know immediately what is going on I

261
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,809
can tell if the lights are on I can tell

262
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,760
if the lights are off I can tell if the

263
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,679
air conditioner did or did not cycle on

264
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,539
as needed I can tell if the extraction

265
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,149
fan to get rid of the humidity cycled

266
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:37,360
off and on as needed also I can set

267
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,578
parameters in the pol grow unit it will

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,250
send me an email if something gets out

269
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:44,349
of the parameters which I set so if I

270
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,169
tell it hey when it's 87 degrees in here

271
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,639
send me an email and when it hits 87

272
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,439
degrees I get an email and it says hey

273
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,899
Rasta Jeff your pol grow unit has

274
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,120
detected that you are above desired

275
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,039
temperatures and then I can go oh [ __ ] I

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,570
need to go to the grow if I'm not where

277
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,159
that grow is I could drive to the grow

278
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,079
which ever grow it is I've got these in

279
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,850
multiple locations that I can log into

280
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,799
and look so I could say how's the grow

281
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,300
in Pueblo West that one's doing good

282
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,789
how's the grow in Colorado Springs

283
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,528
that's doing good and I can look at all

284
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:13,599
of those grows while I'm chilling at

285
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,789
lunch I don't have to go anywhere I can

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,740
monitor those conditions so the first

287
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,199
monitor I would recommend for your grow

288
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,440
environment would be a pl grow systems

289

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,420
minder unit to put in your grow and find

308
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,549
out what is happening in your grow room

309
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,409
we need to get that room dialed in and

310
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:24,529
this is a perfect opportunity to help

311
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:28,069

00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,819
to play with in this grow room it is

326
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,189
yours to keep I would just like some

327
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,080
updates and some info on how well it

328
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,550
works for you how about that ladies and

329
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,440
gentlemen a random giveaway in the

330
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,429
middle of a podcast now there is more to

331
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,350
this email we should cover

332
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,879
they also say I would like my

333
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,409
information about temperature and

334
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,129
humidity to be as accurate as possible

335
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:21,529
both inside and outside of my tents I

336
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:24,320
agree so I'm wondering now if you are

337
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,970
putting your two individual hygrometers

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,070
and thermometers inside and one outside

339
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,690
the tent and checking those readings and

340
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,879
getting two wildly different readings or

341
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,680
if those two thermometers are actually

342
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,600
sitting next to each other and showing

343
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,919
you wildly different readings that's

344
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,629
alright we're gonna figure it out

345
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,459
because you've got a minder unit coming

346
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,679
your way pretty soon we'll get your room

347
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,780
all dialed in once you get that minder

348
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,539
unit you can find out what actually

349
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:49,370
works which thermometer hygrometer is

350
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,230
working for you you can place that one

351
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,970
outside of the tent you can put the peel

352
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,039
grow system inside of the tent you

353
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,629
should be all set up if you like the pl

354
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,549
grow enough you can get another one

355
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,200
and put that outside of the tent you can

356
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,759
have it all dialed in and pay a lot of

357
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,280
good attention you're really gonna have

358
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,009
a lot of fun with this there is more to

359
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,079
this email question number two I am

360
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:11,389
lucky to have central air conditioning

361
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,520
coming through a vent into my grow room

362
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,169
that is very beneficial it goes on to

363
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,379
say I have been struggling with heat

364
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:22,099
problems due to the 2000 watt and 3000

365
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:24,049
watt LEDs that I am using on top of that

366
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,810
plants are in flower and are transpiring

367
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:29,299
tons of moisture into the air it's like

368
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:31,489
gardening and a rain forest in here I

369
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,439
just added a duck fan to boost the

370
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,120
airflow from the air-conditioning vent

371
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,839
and it's helping to cool the room down

372
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,539
but I still need to do more my question

373
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,490
is should I have the cooler air blow

374
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:46,009
directly into the tent via one of the

375
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,610
lower openings in the tent or should I

376
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,930
cool the room outside of the tent all

377
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,980
right we've got some great questions in

378
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,629
here we've got a lot of great

379
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,789
information to work with we've got a

380
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,620
tent it has got a lot of lighting in it

381
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,240
and it is in a small room that has

382
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,129
central air we're trying to cool the

383
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,259
tent it is getting hot because it is a

384
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,639
super hot summer this year let's think

385
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,278
about some of our options the main

386
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,289
question is do I want to blow air

387
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,750
directly into the tent via one of those

388
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:15,409
lower openings or should I cool the room

389
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,659
that when which the tent is in ideally

390
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,399
we would cool the room in which the tent

391
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:21,469
is in but that is going to be a struggle

392
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,169
because you're probably venting the hot

393
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,850
air out from the tent directly into that

394
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,799
room then I don't know where it goes

395
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,540
from there if that hot air is trapped in

396
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,219
that room it's going to be hard to cool

397
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,409
that entire room if you're able to maybe

398
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,879
open the door and get some air exchange

399
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,438
where that hot air can get out of that

400
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,899
room travel through the rest of the

401
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:40,789
house that would be helpful I understand

402
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,169
if that is not an option sometimes we do

403
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:44,448
need to keep the grow rooms contained

404
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:47,539
when you go opening that door you expose

405
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:49,188
odor you expose noise you expose the

406
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,799
option of discovery which may not be

407
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:55,009
something you can open yourself up to so

408
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,889
you may need to run that ducting

409
00:14:55,009 --> 00:15:00,438
directly to that lower passive vent near

410
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:03,769
the bottom of the tent now depending on

411
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:06,078
how cold that incoming air is that's how

412
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,539
I would judge how closely to the plants

413
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,549
I put that incoming air if it's really

414
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:13,789
cold I would back it off a little bit if

415
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:15,500
it's just nice if it's like 78 degrees

416
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:18,379
you may allow that to blow directly

417
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,958
right onto the plants think about any

418
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,419
temperature of air blowing directly on

419
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,619
you for too long will become annoying I

420
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,838
don't care if it is the perfect

421
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,600
temperature any air blowing constantly

422
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,130
on you for a long duration of time

423
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,019
eventually will become annoying if

424
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,879
you're a plant it will happen more

425
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,528
quickly the plant can't move

426
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,869
the plant can't reach over and turn the

427
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:41,028
fan off that plant is stuck there so if

428
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:44,059
you've got a duct blowing on one section

429
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:46,489
of plant pay very close attention to

430
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:48,618
that one plant you're VPD in that

431
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:50,899
section your vapor pressure deficit is

432
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:52,879
going to be highly disrupted because of

433
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,129
that constant airflow and you're

434
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,739
introducing that cool air right to that

435
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:01,220
one area now if you do that you do need

436
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:03,798
more than one mix fan in that grow you

437
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,600
need to stir that fresh air in there and

438
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,918
get that environment mixed up so we

439
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,739
don't create like I said earlier

440
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:12,318
microclimates so if you do duct that

441
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:14,689
duct right to the bottom there feel how

442
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,578
cold it is could you stand having that

443
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:19,038
blowing on you 24 hours a day at that

444
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:20,628
temperature if not the plants don't want

445
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:23,058
it either if it's a good temperature

446
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:24,918
allow that to blow in the plants you may

447
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:26,659
be blowing this across the roots of the

448
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,788
plants they might be hitting right

449
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:30,798
across the pot area that won't be bad as

450
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,298
long as it is not super cold the lower

451
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:34,159
area can tolerate a little cooler

452
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:36,288
conditions that's expected it's shady

453
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,149
down there the plants should tolerate

454
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,278
that quite well now if you were blowing

455
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,259
Arctic chill air if it's [ __ ] 68

456
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,208
degrees or lower in there those plants

457
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,399
may not be super happy about that so pay

458
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,649
attention temperature of the air being

459
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,778
delivered through that ducting that is

460
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,759
going to make all of the decisions for

461
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:54,499
you if it's super cold you've got to

462
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,928
back it off and cool the room which is

463
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:58,850
ideal anyway in a large commercial

464
00:16:56,928 --> 00:17:01,158
horticulture environment that is known

465
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,019
as a lung room it's more common to treat

466
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:05,269
the room get the temperature the

467
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,638
humidity the co2 levels correct in that

468
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,888
room then pipe that air into the actual

469
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:12,048
gross space it's easier that way that's

470
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:14,109
how it's done in other countries that's

471
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:16,068
how it's done in large flower production

472
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,990
that's how it's done in the Dutch

473
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,000
production where they do all the flower

474
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,669
production most of the flowers that we

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,109
have come from Dutch production

476
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:26,689
facilities they're shipped all around

477
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,388
the world in those facilities they use a

478
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,000
long room type environment in those

479
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:33,769
facilities they are also ridiculously

480
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,659
clean and it is very impressive

481
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,370
I wish American grow facilities would

482
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:40,580
take some lessons from that but I'm

483
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:42,319
getting way off track now ideally you

484
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:44,089
would cool that entire room and pump

485
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,829
that air into the tent that era would

486
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:47,599
just move in through the bottom vents

487
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,879
hopefully you have got an extraction fan

488
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,769
at the top pulling out

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,690
the heat and humidity that will create

490
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,250
just a normal airflow the air will come

491
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,480
in through the bottom it'll pass up over

492
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,940
the plants and go right out through the

493
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,380
top naturally heat rises so that will

494
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,600
help encourage the heat rise up to the

495
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,040
top your humidity is gonna go up to the

496
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,509
top hopefully you've got a carbon filter

497
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,849
in there so you're sucking out the heat

498
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:09,849
and humidity now the key is that all of

499
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:11,529
that stuff that heat the humidity all of

500
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:13,509
that air is going to be stuck in that

501
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,220
room unless you've got somewhere for it

502
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,769
to go I don't know your exit strategy

503
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,319
for that air I don't know your plan to

504
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:23,559
replenish that air you need to get rid

505
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,139
of that stale stagnant co2 depleted air

506
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,819
and replace it with some fresh co2

507
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,680
enriched oxygen that is the appropriate

508
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:31,899
temperature and the appropriate humidity

509
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,060
the most common ways to do that are

510
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,740
ducts in and ducts out most commonly

511
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,659
you've got a power ducked out sucking

512
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,490
air out and that naturally draws air in

513
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,620
it's all about displacement it works on

514
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,870
its own that may not be an option for

515
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:46,599
you I understand that what you may have

516
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:48,939
to do you said that it is very humid in

517
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,009
your environment you may need to add a

518
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,960
dehumidifier that will help you get the

519
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:54,549
humidity down in that room that'll make

520
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,130
it feel much more comfortable for the

521
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,019
plants so if you're unable to add some

522
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,120
sort of an extraction fan or a blower to

523
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:03,220
remove that stale stagnant air from the

524
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,109
room or possibly open the door you may

525
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,509
want to consider adding a dehumidifier

526
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:09,309
to your room and again with the

527
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:11,440
dehumidifier you've got the option of

528
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,269
putting that directly in the tent or you

529
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,549
can put that in the room in which the

530
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,349
tent is in if it sucks up a lot of space

531
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,359
a lot of square footage in your tent I

532
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,459
would consider putting it in the room if

533
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,379
you are growing on tables or trays and

534
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,880
you've got plenty of floor space why not

535
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,050
throw that the humidifier down there on

536
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,720
the floor where you've got some open

537
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,579
real estate again I don't have all of

538
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,019
the details about your grow I don't know

539
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:34,419
what you've got going on so I can only

540
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,799
give you options based on the idea the

541
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,600
blueprint that I've built in my head

542
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,549
based on the information you have sent

543
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,619
me but it sounds like the dehumidifier

544
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,480
may be the next thing you need to get

545
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,039
for this grow another thing I would

546
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,170
consider I don't know if this is an

547
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,269
option you say that you are watering a

548
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,720
lot and the plants are transpiring tons

549
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:55,690
of moisture into the air an idea is how

550
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,940
about watering less water a little bit

551
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,470
more frequently so that way you don't

552
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,240
have all that water in the room all of

553
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,650
that water in the pot all the water from

554
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,329
transpiration it is all

555
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,250
in the air maybe don't put so much water

556
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,619
in there let it cycle let it do its

557
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,559
thing then water twice a day instead of

558
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,789
one big fat watering once a day again I

559
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,579
don't know the size of pot you're

560
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,200
working with I don't know if you're in

561
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,269
Cocoa I don't know if you're in hydro I

562
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,220
don't know if you were in soilless mix I

563
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:23,589
don't know your options that is simply a

564
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,799
suggestion that may help you out less

565
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,629
water more frequently may be a benefit

566
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,549
for this type of environment now one

567
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,890
thing that comes to mind you may simply

568
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:35,079
be over watering if you have got that

569
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,570
much air in the room you may have put

570
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,609
too much air into the plants they can

571
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,679
only let out as much as we give them and

572
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,019
if we are giving them too much they may

573
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,940
try to let out too much now that could

574
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,980
be environmental that could be watering

575
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,390
that could be a lot of things we are

576
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,009
going to figure that out because you're

577
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,140
gonna get a PL minder unit you'll be

578
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:55,210
able to dial in the VPD then we can

579
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,980
decide how to set up the ducting we can

580
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,630
decide how to pipe that cool air into

581
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,849
there then we can decide if we need to

582
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,340
add a dehumidifier I would absolutely

583
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:05,349
work on cooling the room and circulating

584
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:07,929
that air as much as possible I would

585
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,699
absolutely consider getting some ducting

586
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,130
going some sort of extraction you need

587
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,799
to evacuate that old air if possible if

588
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,720
you cannot evacuate that old air I would

589
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,089
recommend putting a dehumidifier in the

590
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,549
room to reduce the relative humidity in

591
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:24,579
the room then another thing you may want

592
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:26,950
to consider is co2 enrichment you may

593
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:29,019
want to augment the co2 levels in that

594
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,390
room since it is all sealed up and your

595
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,789
air is not going anywhere anyway pump

596
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,790
that [ __ ] with co2 and your plants will

597
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:38,559
go cutbank Kapow again I don't know if

598
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,690
you've got an extraction fan I don't

599
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,119
know your ducting setup it says you just

600
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,289
added a duct fan to boost air flow but I

601
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,149
don't know where that is coming or going

602
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,240
from I don't know if that is just a stir

603
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,460
fan but I hope I gave you some useful

604
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,069
guidance and advice I know you're gonna

605
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,870
make great use of the PIO grow minder

606
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:57,549
unit that will be coming your way so big

607
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,679
thank you for the great email if you

608
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,149
have got any follow-up questions based

609
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,860
on the information that I have given you

610
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,050
today I would love to hear back from you

611
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,669
I'm already expecting one message from

612
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,829
you so let me know if you need more

613
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,380
information get back to me so we can get

614
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:13,869
you that pol minder unit and then let me

615
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,000
know how it all goes once you've got the

616
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,579
ducting set up and the minder unit in

617
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,618
place

618
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,358
once those are added in we will know if

619
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,858
you need to add the dehumidifier then

620
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:23,808
from there we can decide if you want to

621
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:25,458
add some co2 then we will make

622
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:27,168
additional adjustments and we will get

623
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:29,690
that room going Kabang

624
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,219
Kapow all right st. Stephen I want to

625
