for a great question we've got a few

68
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,158
details here about the garden that are

69
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,919
not necessary we're going to throw that

70
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,560
first page over there we're going to

71
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,919
jump into the second page because this

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
is where the question Pops in it says

73
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,079
please describe your problem and

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,959
everything you've done to fix it the

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,719
question goes a lot like this it says

76
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,080
Hey Rasta Jeff the problem is simple it

77
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,479
is spidermites yes the dreaded

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,480
spidermite every grower at some point in

79
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,280
time is going to experience spidermites

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,199
if you have not experienced spidermites

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,080
yet uh you were bragging you're going

82
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,318
not me never had it well guess what

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,120
they're coming just because you just

84
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,639
said that that is how they work they

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,799
know you're bragging they are on their

86
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,518
way they will be in your grow soon start

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,799
taking care of [ __ ] have no fear we're

88
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,920
going to talk about how to take care of

89
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,519
that here but spidermites everybody's

90
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,719
going to get them once everybody's

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,719
either had them or will have them very

92
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,598
common we can talk about ways to prevent

93
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,079
them but it is a very easy pest to bring

94
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,759
home a very easy pest to get also with a

95
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,000
little bit of strategy a little bit of

96
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,158
preparation a little bit of watchful eye

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,840
and eye for detail the spidermites are

98
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,679
not too problematic to get rid of if we

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
notice them early once they start moving

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
around infesting all of the plants

101
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,119
getting in all of the rooms it's more of

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,399
a pain in the ass but it is never

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,478
impossible to get rid of spidermites I

104
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,719
can get rid of I think I can get rid of

105
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,639
any pest given enough time uh given

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
enough budget and enough manpower and a

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,519
proper strategy I can eradicate any pest

108
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,319
in any cultivation facility how big or

109
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,719
small it is let's stay focused here

110
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,478
we're going to talk about integrated

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,479
Pest Management today and we're going to

112
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,120
focus mostly on spidermites this

113
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:39,560
question says how do I get rid of the

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
spiderm mites without losing all of my

115
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,639
strains that is a very good question

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,199
says some of these strains I've had for

117
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,680
years uh bro as a seed breeder as

118
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,160
somebody who relies on my uh strains my

119
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,600
genetics my mother plants I definitely

120
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,560
understand how important it is to not

121
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,479
lose those strains it goes on it says I

122
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,560
have sprayed with soapy water followed

123
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,680
by a cold rinsing now I have an exhaust

124
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,360
fan cranked up with some serious wind

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,240
trauma the wind is a good idea that's a

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,840
good place to start the message goes on

127
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,400
it says I do need to clear this out

128
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,038
before my new seed order arrives don't

129
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,918
make me cry I will be 70 this year well

144
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,159
little bit about spidermites I'm going

145
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,120
to do my best to not break your heart

146
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,120
here but some of this may be challenging

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
some of it may be a little bit of work

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
but together we will get rid of those

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,638
spidermites I do have a lot of stuff

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,439
written down here uh you said that you

151
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,680
started with um soapy water followed by

152
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,639
a cold rinsing that is a good start but

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I bet you those spidermites just laugh

154
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,960
at you uh spider mites have been

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,400
evolving I got some spidermites a while

156
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,478
back from California this was several

157
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,439
years ago they're gone they've been

158
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,159
defeated but it was a challenge I got

159
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,519
some new mites from California these

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
meno mites these super mites uh the

161
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,839
mites are evolving these were like the

162
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,800
Ninja Turtles of spider mites I could

163
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,000
not get rid of them they took anything I

164
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,759
threw at them uh it took a year and it

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,439
took a really solid winter to get rid of

166
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,038
them I needed that Colorado winter to

167
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,120
come in and I blasted that cold air in

168
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,680
the grow room uh crippled some plants a

169
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,120
little bit but that is what got rid of

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,280
them uh so the mites are evolving I bet

171
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,519
that that soapy cold water uh they just

172
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,119
laughed at you they're like oh yeah we

173
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,198
needed a bath and so they just cleaned

174
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,519
themselves up in it so let's talk more

175
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
in depth about getting rid of these

176
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,038
mites something that I wrote down is

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,400
when trying to eradicate a pest let's

178
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,680
focus on the pest we are facing I see

179
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,519
people just uh on the internet on social

180
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,560
media in general just saying hey I've

181
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,519
got spider mites what should I spray and

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
then people will recommend crazy random

183
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,719
[ __ ] like spray safer soap or spray

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,478
oregano oil or spray this or there's

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,879
many terrible examples I could give why

186
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,279
not focus on the pest you're trying to

187
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,479
eradicate research that Pest and apply

188
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,239
the product that will get rid of that

189
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,199
pest if I told you right now that you're

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,319
going to the Olympics tomorrow would you

191
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,800
say what what event am I in or would you

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,720
just prepare for every single event if I

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
told you you're going to be in the

194
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,199
Olympics tomorrow and you're a figure

195
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,959
skater would you go preparing for the

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,919
bob sled team or would you prepare for

197
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,719
the next few months to be a figure

198
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,079
skater what I'm saying is prepare for

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,120
the thing that we need to attack if

200
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,758
you're facing spider mites let's attack

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,759
spidermites if you've got thrips let's

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,639
attack thrips if you've got fungus snats

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,038
let's go right for the fungus snats

204
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,680
let's not just use random generic hippie

205
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,038
ideas that might work for everything

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,240
let's focus in and attack the insects we

207
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,158
are trying to attack so like I said just

208
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,280
a moment ago let's attack the pest we

209
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,439
are trying to attack no matter which

210
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,119
insect pest Predator whatever it is we

211
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,240
are trying to get rid of in our garden

212
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,079
it has a life cycle it's going to live a

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,918
certain amount of time if it's if it's a

214
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,399
bigger pest something like a rabbit or a

215
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,560
deer that is a pest that gets in our

216
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,638
Garden we're not going to talk as much

217
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,680
about that but those could live four

218
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,918
years if it's an insect its whole life

219
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,840
cycle could be a few days then we got to

220
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,839
learn also not only the life cycle of

221
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,439
our pest but we need to understand the

222
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,758
breeding cycle of those pests as well

223
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,399
some of the bugs we're battling are born

224
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,158
pregnant what yeah they came out

225
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,799
pregnant already what kind of hood bugs

226
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,399
do we have but that's how they are so

227
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,639
understand the life cycle of the pest

228
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,120
you're dealing with understand the

229
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,360
breeding cycle of the pest you're

230
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,280
dealing with then let's disrupt both of

231
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,278
those processes with within these bugs

232
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,799
then we have a better chance of beating

233
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,679
these insects so do a little research

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,038
understand how do they live where do

235
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,759
they live do they live under the foliage

236
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,918
they do they live on the stems do they

237
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,919
live in the dirt where do these bugs

238
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,600
live understand where they live how they

239
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,000
live and how they breed and now we're

240
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,200
getting into their heads we've got a

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,799
much better opportunity to eradicate

242
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,240
these Intruders now once we've

243
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,639
identified the insect which we are

244
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,039
choosing to do battle with today's

245
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,639
victim is going to be spidermites they

246
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,439
tried to come into our room we're going

247
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,278
to show them we don't play that game

248
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,000
we're going to get rid of these

249
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,159
spidermites once you've identified the

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,559
pest then you need to make some personal

251
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,439
ethical decisions how do you want to

252
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,759
attack these spider mites or whichever

253
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
bug you may be facing one good option is

254
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,759
predator bugs do you want to start with

255
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,880
predator mites or Predator insects in

256
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,519
your grow and use those as a way to

257
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,399
eradicate your current bug situation

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,240
that is a very useful very cost-

259
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,000
effective way to go about it but you've

260
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,759
got to release bugs into your grow that

261
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,958
can take a little bit of time for those

262
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,759
bugs to uh establish a colony get in

263
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,879
there and find where they need to go to

264
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,519
go find the the bug that they need to

265
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,360
eat then there's a battle that needs to

266
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,278
happen and then eventually uh your

267
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,839
Predators will out eat all of the other

268
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,480
bugs and then they will die off as well

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,240
or they'll move along if you've got a

270
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,920
Perpetual environment maybe those bugs

271
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,839
will stick around you can make that work

272
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,879
but uh if you run out of bugs they may

273
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,640
disappear so Predator bugs is a very

274
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,159
effective way of eradicating bugs in

275
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,439
your grow but it does take a little bit

276
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,799
of time for them to get to work how

277
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,440
about sprayed pesticide applications

278
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,479
that is always a very reliable way to

279
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,600
get rid of almost almost any pest is a

280
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,879
sprayed application now here's where you

281
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,959
have to make more ethical decisions what

282
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,879
types of sprays do you want to apply to

283
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,000
your garden a lot of people are going to

284
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,519
say I use all organic products but then

285
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,278
I'm going to remind you that cyanide is

286
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,320
organic and if you get any of that in

287
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,360
your body you're going to get sick and

288
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,399
die so uh don't Focus too much on the

289
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,800
word organic don't be sold by the word

290
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,759
organic let's focus more on the active

291
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,039
ingredients and inactive ingredients in

292
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,919
that bottle do some research on what is

293
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,519
in the bottle then think about how

294
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,879
gentle or non- gentle you want to be how

295
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,360
aggressive you want to go how much

296
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,879
chemical blast you want to use um some

297
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,839
people are going to say it's a scale of

298
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,600
organic to nuclear that's a good range

299
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,079
organic like we just said is kind of a

300
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,399
buzzword but do you want to go gentle

301
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,559
hippie soap or do you want to go [ __ ]

302
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,759
aoid how far in between do you want to

303
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,359
go that is up to you as a farmer what is

304
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,439
going to happen to the product that you

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,320
are going to grow and sell are you going

306
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,959
to smoke it are you going to consume it

307
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,760
yourself are you making concentrates out

308
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,399
of it if you're making concentrates your

309
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,278
con concentrating the pesticide if it's

310
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
still in that plant are you going to

311
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,639
make edibles and then are you going to

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,079
eat those pesticides yourself are you

313
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,480
going to sell that product are you

314
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,439
selling it to uh the street or are you

315
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,920
selling it to Medical uh medical

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,920
cannabis consumers there's a lot of

317
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,039
things to think about here if you're

318
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,559
going to smoke it yourself do whatever

319
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,039
you want with it do whatever you feel

320
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,078
comfortable with it if somebody else is

321
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,078
going to get this product be very

322
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,359
careful and very uh very thoughtful

323
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,199
about what you spray or apply to your

324
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,839
plants it could be uh nutrients

325
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
pesticides anything in this realm think

326
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,720
about what you're putting in there uh

327
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,039
think about it if it's for you that's

328
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,399
important but if it's going to someone

329
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,679
else it's your responsibility to pass a

330
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,958
safe clean ethical product along to your

331
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,439
consumers they're giving you money

332
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,119
they're giving you trust they're

333
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,600
expecting cannabis that is safe to be

334
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,839
consumed make sure you give them that so

335
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,680
whatever you're going to spray on there

336
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,079
make sure that it is something that is

337
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,479
consumable that you would consume

338
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,439
understand the halflife and the duration

339
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
of Life uh that these chemicals will

340
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,680
last in your plant if you're spraying

341
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,720
something sustain mic it could stick

342
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,919
around in that plant for quite a long

343
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,839
time research halflife start

344
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,159
understanding how long it takes for that

345
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,200
uh pesticide to break down within that

346
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
plant and be gone hopefully it's gone by

347
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,040
the time you harvest but pay attention

348
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,120
to those sort of things uh also there

349
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,679
are a lot of things to understand when

350
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,039
it comes to applying pesticides that

351
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,159
people completely Overlook but

352
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,159
understand what you're giving your

353
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,519
customers please let's think a lot about

354
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,519
that I do have a few more things I want

355
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,039
to touch on before we go too deep into

356
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,799
pesticides um the key to a clean grow

357
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,120
room and the key to not getting spider

358
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,399
mites or the key to getting rid of

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,278
spider mites is really don't get them I

360
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,639
know for this person it's too late but

361
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,958
maybe some of you are saying I've never

362
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,240
had mites the key is prevention in a

363
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,319
commercial facility we start at day one

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
with preventing spider mites or any

365
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
other pest from entering the room it's

366
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,880
your responsibility as the farmer to

367
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,039
make sure no pests get in that room and

368
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,958
if they do it's your job to react

369
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,480
quickly and understand how to mitigate

370
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:58,439
the problem before it becomes a tragedy

371
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
in that grow space a lot of people like

372
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,519
to blame soil bags for bringing in bugs

373
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
guess what you brought the bag into the

374
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,278
grow you should have understood what was

375
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,839
coming along with that keep that sort of

376
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,439
stuff in mind so prevention is key how

377
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,560
do we prevent bugs from entering the

378
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,040
grow space clean up basic cleanliness is

379
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,958
one of the main ingredients to a

380
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,639
successful grow clean everything if

381
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,239
you've got a leaf on the floor get that

382
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,919
leaf out of there that leaf went into a

383
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,799
trash bag or a trash can get that trash

384
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,759
can Andor trash bag dumped and out of

385
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,359
the grow facility to a dumpster outside

386
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,480
as far away as you can get it move that

387
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,240
set yourself up for Success if you've

388
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,879
got a bunch of debris just random [ __ ]

389
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,039
in the grow space that doesn't need to

390
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,559
be there if it's your grow tools your

391
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,000
T-shirt your drink uh whatever doesn't

392
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,799
need to be in there get it out of there

393
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,399
those are more places for bugs to hide

394
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,278
things for them to hide under places for

395
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,399
them to hide on clean up create a basic

396
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:52,919
standard operating procedure for your

397
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,480
cultivation facility for a sanitary grow

398
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,120
environment whatever that means to you

399
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,399
how are you going to I don't know where

400
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,679
your grow is I don't know if it's in

401
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,198
your house house I don't know if it's in

402
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,120
your basement your garage I don't know

403
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,078
if it's in a big commercial facility I

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,159
don't know if it's in a barn in a field

405
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,198
whatever you need to do to create a

406
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,278
standard operating procedure to create a

407
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,120
sanitary growing environment that is

408
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,399
what you need to figure out as the Ganja

409
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,679
Farmer on duty so if you need to build a

410
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,078
clean room where you walk in and change

411
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,599
your shoes your clothes uh spray your

412
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,599
hair down with something wrap your hair

413
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,079
up put it in a hat however you want to

414
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,079
do it uh put on some gloves then go into

415
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,198
the grow space that may be a step that

416
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,958
you need to take if you're coming from

417
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:33,319
one grow to the other definitely have a

418
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,278
space where you can stop and change a

419
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,920
lab coat or do something to just make

420
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,159
another layer so that when you're in

421
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,519
here in this grow space all the

422
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,519
spidermites are sticking onto that uh

423
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,278
lab coat take it off go in another room

424
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,120
with a different lab coat that may help

425
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:47,879
mitigate spreading the problem but

426
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,600
create an sop so that you don't bring

427
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,559
bugs in and you do not move bugs around

428
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,879
get the trash gone the trash doesn't

429
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,638
need to just go so if your grow is in

430
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,919
your basement don't just bring the trash

431
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,839
up to the kitchen or the garage it needs

432
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,240
to go out it needs to get to the curve

433
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,120
as quickly as possible get rid of that

434
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,919
[ __ ] uh clean you clean yourself clean

435
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,600
your clothing I've got dreadlocks when I

436
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,519
go into the grow I tie up my dreadlocks

437
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,920
and put a hat over them so that if

438
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
anything does try to climb on me

439
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,958
hopefully it stays on the hat uh people

440
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,559
always ask yes I do wash the dreadlocks

441
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,278
but um they could get in there I could

442
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,399
move some bugs around in the dreadlocks

443
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,000
so that's why we got to be very careful

444
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,159
uh what about your equipment do you have

445
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,759
a separate set what about shoes I see a

446
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,919
lot of people wear the same shoes

447
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,240
outside and then you go into a grow

448
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,679
space wherever you walk through outside

449
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,399
were there spider mites was there

450
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,439
powdery mildew perhaps on a plant was

451
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,039
there a fungus now was there a thrip

452
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,759
what did you bring in from outside on

453
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,879
your shoes into your grow space cuz your

454
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,480
grow space is a beautiful environment as

455
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,240
soon as you got in there that spidermite

456
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,480
that thrip that fungus net whatever it

457
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,000
was I went oh this is [ __ ] nice and

458
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,120
it went and found a hotel in one of your

459
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,198
plants so change your clothes change

460
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,879
your shoes what about your gear do you

461
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,958
have and we should be doing this anyway

462
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,278
because hopl and vroid is running ramp

463
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,958
now are you changing scissors between

464
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,039
different grows are you using gear for

465
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,078
outside that you're using inside don't

466
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,838
do that don't cross-contaminate think

467
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,439
about the equipment now let's kind of

468
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,800
segue into things that we can actually

469
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,079
do within the grow uh to the plants to

470
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,240
help mitigate pest problems one thing I

471
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,519
really think is beneficial is

472
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,079
defoliation defoliate all the leaves

473
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,879
with the big purple pedal or the

474
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,879
gigantic leaves that are blocking the

475
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,240
Sun from getting to the buds pull those

476
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,278
leaves off of there you don't need those

477
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
leaves anyway those leaves are where the

478
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,480
bud are going to hang out where do you

479
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
get spidermites the bottom of the leaves

480
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,720
where do you get powdery mildew on top

481
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,638
of the leaves no leaves no problems get

482
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,920
them out of there make his few leaves as

483
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,959
possible in that room but keep the

484
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,318
plants healthy and you will mitigate

485
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,399
pest problems another thing that I like

486
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,519
and this listener mentioned is wind if

487
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,600
you can get some fans going in that room

488
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,198
spidermites and bugs do not like wind

489
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
they like a nice calm place they could

490
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,318
chill out they can eat some food they

491
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,000
can get some ass and they can make some

492
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,000
webs that's what they want disrupt that

493
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,559
make it uncomfortable for them

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,240
then another thing I talked about a

495
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,480
moment ago is don't cross-contaminate

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,880
your grows if you've got home grows in

497
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,759
multiple rooms don't go from room a to

498
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,919
room B without taking care of yourself

499
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,558
especially if you see a problem clean up

500
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,439
change your lab coat change your shoes

501
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,038
change whatever you need to do if you've

502
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,959
got grows in two different houses

503
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:19,959
perhaps change clothes from house to

504
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,240
house if you're working in multiple

505
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,640
cultivation facilities as a consultant

506
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,519
definitely change your shoes and your

507
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,640
clothes between facilities if possible a

508
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,000
lot of facilities now have a foot wash

509
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,240
you step into this little tray and it

510
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,759
puts [ __ ] all over your shoes it's

511
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,798
cleaner stuff it's fine I'm a sneaker

512
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,440
head it's cool it'll spray this Splash

513
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,279
this [ __ ] on your shoes and then you

514
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,759
step onto another tray and it puts a

515
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,960
little booty right over your shoe now

516
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,038
you're walking around with fresh clean

517
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
feet in there those are really great for

518
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,599
a commercial facility um are there any

519
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,919
bushes or flowers or shrubs or plants

520
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,279
outside of your house or your commercial

521
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,360
facility that are housing insects uh it

522
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,960
is not uncommon to see somebody just go

523
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,918
to Lowe's and get some uh spray product

524
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,200
again use do some I said Lowe's also go

525
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,159
to your local home hardware store uh

526
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,480
local hardware store if you have one but

527
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,080
go get some pesticide spray and spray

528
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,599
that on the plants outside so that you

529
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,879
can get rid of the bugs out there as

530
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,199
well but when you do that they're going

531
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,120
to try to move in so make sure you're

532
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,080
prepared for that but treat the outdoor

533
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,798
once or twice a year so there's no bugs

534
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,599
in the shrubs and bushes outside if you

535
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,319
can remove those go get rid of those

536
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,798
shrubs and bushes but I understand

537
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,119
nature is happening out there we can't

538
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,679
chop down all the trees please don't do

539
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,639
that all right another thing I really

540
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,600
want to make sure to mention is I do see

541
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,038
a lot of yellow sticky traps in use one

542
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,639
thing to think about is those are not uh

543
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,240
to eradicate bugs those are to indicate

544
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,960
the presence of a pest uh you should

545
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
have those all over the grow every six

546
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,440
or 12 feet apart there should be a

547
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,159
yellow sticky card so that when you walk

548
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,080
by it you can take a look you should

549
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,799
look at it as you walk by in the morning

550
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,918
walk by as you look at lunch walk by at

551
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,720
the end of the day just take a peek if

552
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,840
there's one bug on there at one point in

553
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,120
time make a mental note I saw a bug if

554
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,279
there's three bugs on there later make a

555
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,959
note three bugs should it's increasing

556
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,399
pay attention if there's one or two bugs

557
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,919
that's going to happen just they fly

558
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
around they see light [ __ ] happens but

559
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,840
if you start getting increasing numbers

560
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,279
of bugs that's a sign [ __ ] is happening

561
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,319
in your grow you need to start taking

562
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,079
care of those so hang yellow sticky

563
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,519
traps or even the blue sticky traps in

564
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,879
the grow to indicate the presence of

565
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,240
some pests now let's talk more about

566
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,919
preventative um preventative do you want

567
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,400
to release Predator bugs I've talked

568
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,480
about the Predator bugs there are many

569
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,640
options for predator bugs like I said

570
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,079
before choose your bug wisely make sure

571
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,000
you're getting the predators that you

572
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,839
think you will have pest so you can

573
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,119
fight what is coming or do you want to

574
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,879
apply sprays if you're going to apply

575
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,158
sprays I recommend sprays on a rotation

576
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,480
have multiple products on hand spray

577
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,840
them on a rotation on a schedule in M gr

578
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,079
environments I try to spray on Monday if

579
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,319
I see any sort of a problem I step it up

580
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,158
and I spray on Monday and Thursday at

581
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,000
the change of seasons I spray on Monday

582
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,000
and Thursday it just got cold I

583
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,038
anticipate bugs trying to come in they

584
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,240
got an extra spray this week on Thursday

585
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:01,879
just just to make sure nothing sneaks in

586
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,480
now when you are spraying products one

587
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,200
thing I highly recommend is research

588
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,038
every product which you are going to

589
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,679
apply understand the product you were

590
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,400
going to apply understand the active

591
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,320
ingredients understand the inactive

592
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,000
ingredients understand what those active

593
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,558
ingredients can do to you if you are

594
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,440
exposed to them if you spray that and

595
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,200
get some on your skin what is going to

596
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,440
happen to you understand those sorts of

597
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,558
risks open up the label on those bottles

598
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,159
every pesticide bottle has a label and

599
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,440
it unfolds there's a little booklet in

600
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,679
there that will tell you a lot about

601
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,480
that pesticide

602
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,840
when you read that see if it says

603
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,038
warning danger Hazard see if it's got a

604
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,038
skull and crossbones look at the level

605
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,960
of danger level of Hazard which that

606
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,960
pesticide presents then read about the

607
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,480
personal protective equipment required

608
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,798
to apply that pesticide many of them are

609
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,240
going to tell you wear long sleeves wear

610
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,720
gloves uh cover up your feet for sure

611
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,839
when you're applying a pesticide don't

612
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
go doing it Barefoot like a hippie I

613
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,599
recommend a respirator if you're

614
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,400
spraying with a paint sprayer or

615
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,480
anything that makes bubbles wear a

616
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,159
respirator because because you don't

617
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
want to breathe in those micro bubbles

618
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
with pesticide in it also eye protection

619
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,720
is a must and if you got long hair

620
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,679
dreadlocks or even not cover up your

621
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,319
head and be safe but make sure you

622
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:11,960
research the personal protective

623
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,079
equipment needed for the pesticide you

624
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,798
are applying now since I am certified by

625
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,240
the Colorado Department of Agriculture

626
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,440
as a pesticide applicator and Handler I

627
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,880
am also train the trainer certified by

628
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,120
the Colorado State University and the

629
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,039
Colorado Department of Agriculture I was

630
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,839
trained by Theo walker uh just give it

631
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,879
some credentials here but with all that

632
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,639
being said I should remind you about

633
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,159
something that is called the reentry

634
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,240
interval whenever we apply a pesticide

635
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,520
we should apply that pesticide uh with

636
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,359
the lights off and then safely exit that

637
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,759
room and then we should hang a sign on

638
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,278
the door if you're working with anybody

639
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,400
else there's a sign that is required on

640
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,359
the door that says hey guess what we

641
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,038
sprayed a pesticide we sprayed this at

642
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,319
this time you're not allowed to enter

643
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,200
for this many hours from that time so

644
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,278
that nobody goes in that room and gets

645
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,038
wet pesticide product on their skin

646
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,480
breathes in that Vapor we're trying to

647
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,200
be safe there's what is called a

648
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,640
re-entry interval don't go in the room

649
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
until that re-entry interval is up and

650
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,360
many people may not know this but if we

651
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
are applying a pesticide indoors you

652
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,558
should double the recommended re-entry

653
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,000
interval printed on that bottle most of

654
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:19,038
those products are not designed to be

655
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
sprayed and applied indoors most of them

656
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,480
are for outdoor commercial use or

657
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,240
outdoor agricultural use when we apply

658
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,839
these products indoors we are not

659
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,720
getting sunshine on them we are not

660
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,399
getting wind like we would normally get

661
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,640
we don't have the natural environment to

662
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,798
break down that pesticide and dry it up

663
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,759
and make the plant process it or break

664
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,639
down the way that it should uh naturally

665
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,960
outdoors so it is highly recommended to

666
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,480
double the re-entry interval when

667
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,600
applying a pesticide spray application

668
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,599
indoors I just want to say that because

669
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,798
I'm certified by the department of a and

670
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,359
it would feel very irresponsible to not

671
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:53,918
give you that disclaimer for

672
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,839
preventative measures I recommend

673
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,960
spraying once a week like I said before

674
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,798
if you see any problems popping up

675
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,000
double that spray spray Monday and spray

676
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,879
Thursday if the problem gets bad

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,640
consider spraying three times a week but

678
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,278
that will get brutal on the plants

679
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,080
you'll see them respond they may tell

680
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,200
you hey that is too much you may have to

681
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,759
settle it down especially depending on

682
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,759
the products you're going to apply I

683
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,599
have said before that you can apply what

684
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,038
I call a tank mix that is multiple

685
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,439
pesticides mixed together at one time uh

686
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,599
in one tank and spray it you can do that

687
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,200
if you research each pesticide which you

688
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,439
are applying and don't be redundant have

689
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,120
uh if you're going to apply one that is

690
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,798
a Pym base don't put two pyrum based

691
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,319
products in there together but don't get

692
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,679
redundant if you're going to put one

693
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,038
pyin product in there don't mix in just

694
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,000
another pyrin product put something else

695
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,798
a different mode of attack inside of

696
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,079
that mix that way we can hit the bugs

697
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,639
with two different attacks you could

698
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,960
throw a left and when they try to block

699
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,559
the left you could throw that right and

700
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
knock them right the [ __ ] out two

701
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,798
products maybe three products at a time

702
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,880
is not a bad idea if you understand what

703
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,319
and why you are mixing maybe mix a

704
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,640
little batch maybe don't mix a whole

705
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,158
bunch at one time so you don't get a

706
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,880
chem IAL reaction but a tank mix is

707
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,799
highly acceptable now that is my

708
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,000
preventative strategy I spray once a

709
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,679
week with a rotated pesticide schedule

710
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,240
on a schedule every Monday I spray if I

711
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,200
see a problem I step it up to every

712
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,759
Thursday on a schedule I've got a

713
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,759
pesticide rotation there are a few

714
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,919
products I really enjoy I think they

715
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,359
work really well together uh just to

716
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,919
give you a kind of an idea I like to use

717
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,798
uh we'll say botanigard Max on Monday

718
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,120
and then uh Evergreen on Thursday and

719
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,720
then we would probably do something like

720
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,278
um and also make sure you're checking

721
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,558
with your local state guidelines if

722
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,720
you're using this in a commercial

723
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,558
facility I don't know what is regulated

724
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,399
in your state I'm making recommendations

725
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,678
for what I do uh in a personal grow if

726
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:42,798
you're growing in a commercial grow

727
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,120
things are regulated by the me and the

728
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,798
department of a so make sure you pay

729
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,278
attention to that but I would do like

730
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:50,158
the botanigard Max and then Evergreen

731
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,240
and then probably like venerate on the

732
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,278
next one and then just start the

733
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,319
rotation over and if I have a pest

734
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,319
problem I see a couple things I would

735
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,839
possibly do like the Evergreen and

736
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,519
venerate together and then do botanigard

737
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,918
Max and maybe the Evergreen again the

738
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,839
next time just to double up and throw

739
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,000
some super punches but don't be afraid

740
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,278
to do a tank mix and get creative and

741
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
knock those bad [ __ ] out all

742
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:13,839
right I do have notes and I feel like I

743
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,960
fell off my notes where am I attack

744
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,480
we're at the attack phase now let's say

745
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,159
that we do see some bugs in our grow

746
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,278
room now it's time to step it up instead

747
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,240
of just Monday we're spraying Monday and

748
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:27,038
Thursday um this all depends on where

749
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,038
you are in the grow cycle if you're in

750
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,359
veg uh go ahead and spray the [ __ ] out

751
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,839
of them with whatever you want that is

752
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,000
up to your ethical standards if you're

753
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,158
in flower you really need to consider

754
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,038
what you are spraying on these plants uh

755
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,520
if you're in the first 21 days of flower

756
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,000
you've got a lot more opportunity for

757
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,079
sprays the first 10 to 14 days go ahead

758
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,558
and spray away unless you're breeding uh

759
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,759
you don't want to mess up those pistols

760
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:49,398
but it's all about the phase and how far

761
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,440
into flour you are there are some

762
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:52,959
products we could spray later uh I don't

763
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
really want to spray too late if we

764
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,000
don't have to but sometimes it's

765
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,600
necessary if you're going into flour and

766
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,319
you do spot a a bunch of bugs and you

767
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:04,000
want to get rid of them that is the time

768
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:07,439
to overload the garden with those living

769
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Predator bugs uh sworsky hypoaspis miles

770
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Pim pmus Cal fornicus Green Lace Wings

771
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Ro beetles get in there and attack with

772
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,158
everything you can find but if you are

773
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,798
still in the veg phase go ahead and

774
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,440
spray whatever you feel comfortable

775
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,519
start hitting them on Monday with one or

776
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,679
two products hit them again on Thursday

777
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,000
with one or two products keep that going

778
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,600
until you see there are no pests present

779
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,640
maybe even continue one or two

780
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,319
applications even after you think the

781
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,399
bugs are gone it is important to me to

782
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,599
spray every room I've got a mom room a

783
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,038
veg room a clone area a flower area this

784
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,158
is all commercial buildings with a lot

785
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,000
of [ __ ] make sure that everything is

786
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,399
treated equally those mother plants are

787
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,640
where it all starts those veg plants are

788
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,678
the building blocks for flow that flower

789
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,240
room is the bread and butter they're all

790
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,080
equally important make sure that those

791
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,599
bugs are all getting treated in every

792
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,639
room or you're just going to move them

793
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,398
around if you can get those mother

794
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,640
plants super clean and get the veg plant

795
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,798
super clean and then keep them clean

796
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,000
through flow that is the goal so maybe

797
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,639
release a whole [ __ ] ton of Predator

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,159
bugs in your mom room and then those

799
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,200
bugs will keep moving around with you

800
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,880
once you establish colonies keep those

801
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
bugs coming in the mom room every couple

802
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,399
of weeks add more add more uh however

803
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,319
you cut clones keep that schedule going

804
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:19,158
maybe order more bugs every week you cut

805
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,960
clones cut some clones add more bugs cut

806
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,600
some clones add more bugs and it all

807
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,600
moves down the chain from the mom room

808
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,319
to the bedroom to the flower room keep

809
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,119
the bugs alive in there that's just a

810
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,079
good strategy that may work for for you

811
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:32,759
all right where were we attack multiple

812
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,839
modes of attack on an aggressive routine

813
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:38,759
twice a week but like I said a moment

814
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,759
ago be specific don't bring a knife to a

815
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,960
might fight right I'll said that again

816
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,960
don't bring a knife to a might fight if

817
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,278
you're fighting spidermites uh don't

818
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,759
bring something designed to fight thrips

819
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,919
if you're fighting thrips don't bring

820
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,599
some [ __ ] to Des designed to spite to

821
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,799
fight spidermites that's easier than it

822
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,240
sounds I know that was hard to say but

823
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,798
you know what I'm trying to talk about

824
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
if you're fighting spidermites get a

825
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,278
pesticide designed at eradicating

826
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,080
spidermites don't go get some hippie

827
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,200
soap don't try some witchcraft don't do

828
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,839
Voodoo go get a pesticide that says

829
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
designed to eradicate spider mites do

830
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,839
the right thing set yourself up for

831
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,798
Success you're going to spend the money

832
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,000
you're going to spend the time you're

833
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:15,519
going to spend the energy go at it hard

834
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,278
right at the very beginning let's win

835
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,079
the battle now keeping in mind the fact

836
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,278
that we are understanding which pest we

837
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,000
are battling where are those bugs are

838
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,839
they on the underside of the leaves are

839
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,359
they living in the soil where do those

840
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,319
pests reside where are they hanging out

841
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,000
where's the party let's treat that

842
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,960
appropriate area let's spray the bottoms

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,880
of the leaves start at the bottom of the

844
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,000
plant spray the undersides of the leaves

845
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,960
and work your way up to the top then

846
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,720
also possibly maybe a suggestion if

847
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,319
these bugs go into the soil if you got

848
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,079
thrips or fungus Nets we need to treat

849
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,359
the soil we need to do what is called a

850
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,798
soil dredge one of my favorite soil

851
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,798
dredges is Evergreen I'll mix up my

852
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
water just like a a bunch of five gallon

853
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,240
buckets just like I'm going to water the

854
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,278
plants and then I will put an amount of

855
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Evergreen in those buckets and stir it

856
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,159
really really well then I will water

857
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,399
that into the plants until it runs off a

858
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,640
little bit now I'm sure that I've got

859
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:05,678
Evergreen in all of that soil all of

860
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,240
that Medium if you're using cocoa soil

861
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,679
whatever you're working with saturate

862
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,640
that uh repeat again in about 3 or 4

863
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,960
days and now you've probably gotten rid

864
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,399
of all of your soil born pests all the

865
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,519
bugs that were in the dirt are dead

866
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:18,199
they're going to fly up and try to get

867
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,000
to the leaves we have sprayed those

868
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,278
leaves with something maybe a couple of

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,919
things are not going to want to be up

870
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,440
there create a non-desirable environment

871
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,880
for those bugs whether it's a poison or

872
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,120
just something uncomfort able put

873
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,240
something on the leaves and they won't

874
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,558
want to go there so think about what bug

875
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,200
you're working with do you need to treat

876
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,359
the leaves do you need to treat the dirt

877
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,960
do you need to treat both let's do that

878
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,479
let's also clean up the room and

879
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,159
ourselves and Go full heavy Attack Mode

880
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,440
again do you want to go bugs do you want

881
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,480
to go sprays do you want to go organic

882
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
or do you want to go nuclear this is all

883
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,960
up to you there are many suggestions for

884
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
getting rid of spidermites on the

885
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,038
internet they're all going to work but

886
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,919
you just have to decide how ethical that

887
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,839
product is for you and if you want to

888
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,278
consume that or pass that to your

889
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,519
customers now sometimes an infestation

890
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,440
can just get way too far ahead of us

891
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,120
sometimes we don't notice uh sometimes

892
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,120
you go away on vacation you come back

893
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,319
[ __ ] happened uh sometimes you've got a

894
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,879
helper they didn't know what they were

895
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,558
looking for sometimes [ __ ] does get out

896
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,720
of control I try not to let that happen

897
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,119
I try to pay attention maybe you slipped

898
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,319
up maybe you [ __ ] up and you got

899
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,918
spider mes maybe they're real bad and

900
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,918
you're thinking I cannot beat these

901
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,679
plants here is the last ditch effort if

902
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,679
you've tried every pesticide can think

903
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,320
of If youve released all the the bugs

904
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,000
you can think of here is one more idea

905
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,119
that we can do to get rid of these bugs

906
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,558
this is the last ditch effort I would

907
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,158
get a reservoir of water I would put a

908
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,359
pesticide in there you've got a million

909
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,240
[ __ ] options you can use uh you can

910
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:49,599
use anything from hydrogen peroxide to

911
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,720
Smite to banish to Evergreen to Tria 70

912
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:55,158
to venerate to uh much more powerful uh

913
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,600
products I'm not going to mention here

914
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,919
if you got a real problem I'll help you

915
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,759
but I don't want to share these product

916
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,120
names with anybody who doesn't really

917
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,638
have a struggle problem you shouldn't be

918
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,798
using these unless it's a last Stitch

919
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:08,199
effort to save some [ __ ] anyway makes up

920
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,798
a a reservoir a dunk dish of a pesticide

921
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,798
solution then we're going to cut some

922
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:13,519
clones we're going to go to your plant

923
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,839
that's got spidermites on it we're going

924
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,278
to cut a clone off of it then we're

925
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,199
going to dunk it in that dunk mix dunk

926
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,759
it in there and swish the [ __ ] out of it

927
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,919
get the spidermites off of it get the

928
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,879
webbing off of it uh whatever product

929
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,960
you need to use get that [ __ ] off of

930
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,360
there then uh you've got an option some

931
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,519
people people will tell you depending on

932
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:32,439
the pesticide that you just used uh if

933
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,278
you use Smite or banish you do need to

934
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,840
dunk them and rinse them in clean water

935
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,558
and get that pesticide off um the

936
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,000
pesticide is now within the plant it is

937
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,798
moving within the cells of the plant if

938
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,839
you use some things and that will

939
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,319
continue to keep the bugs away but give

940
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,720
them a good dunking and make sure to at

941
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,079
least get all these spidermites the webs

942
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,919
the bugs off of the plant then dunk it

943
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,278
into the wet uh the clean dish to get

944
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,480
rid of the pesticide then pot that clone

945
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:58,000
as usual dip it in your clone solution

946
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,120
uh pop it into the Clone Dome or the

947
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,759
easy clone or however you normally would

948
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,558
now pay very close attention to those

949
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,119
clones as soon as they are rooted and

950
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,278
able to get put into pots we need to

951
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,798
start treating them right away with an

952
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,440
integrated Pest Management routine I

953
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,599
would get the Evergreen out evergreen's

954
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,000
not too uh too brutal on small plants

955
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,439
and give it a light application of

956
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,599
Evergreen I would probably do that uh

957
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,038
Monday and Thursday then next week I'd

958
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,599
probably switch to the venerate then

959
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,919
next week I'd go botanigard Max uh and

960
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,199
then just make sure that we got rid of

961
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,919
the bugs it's going to be easier to to

962
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,679
treat the bugs on these little tiny

963
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,519
plants than it would on these big

964
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,880
gigantic plants so we're going to take

965
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,720
some clones we're going to dunk them

966
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,320
we're going to rinse them uh clip them

967
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,919
dip them and stick them get them in the

968
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,678
cloner however you do your clones that's

969
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,759
a whole other podcast change to that

970
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,679
episode now watch that one but do your

971
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,359
clones then here's the fun part we're

972
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,720
going to put a trash bag over those big

973
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:49,439
mommy plants and we're going to cut

974
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,038

991
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,079
the spider mites that may have come home

992
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,398
with you go straight to the shower clean

993
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,678

00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,120
clothes and now let's start treating

996
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,038
those plants like they're lightly

997
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,678
infested we need to keep the infestation

998
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:37,759
down hopefully we got rid of the most of

999
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,480
the bugs but they could still be there

1000
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,319
so the big plants are gone the babies

1001
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,880
are growing much easier to treat

1002
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,678
hopefully we can preserve our genetics

1003
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,200
that way all right let me make sure I've

1004
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,080
gotten all of the notes cuz I was going

1009
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,440
