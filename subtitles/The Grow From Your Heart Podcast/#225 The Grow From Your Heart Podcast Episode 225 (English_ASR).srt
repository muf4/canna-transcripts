the dab everything was going well and

25
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,260
right towards the end of the dab I just

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,180
started [ __ ] sneezing and I don't

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,590
know what happened it sneezed about 12

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,880
times in a row the smoke came out of my

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,880
ears the smoke came out of my eyes I

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,379
feel like the smoke came out of my nose

31
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,759
it really was kind of kind of not

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,319
pleasant for a couple of seconds there

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,390
my face feels all swollen and puffy like

34
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,758
after you sneeze a whole bunch but the

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,250
good side is it feels super medicated my

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,739
head is very mellow after that there

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,569
should be a fun intro I hope everybody

38
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,699

festival a hash music and art festival

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,560
hosted by our friends at Hitman glass I

54
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,938
was out in a northern part of California

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,460
I want to say Oxnard but I could be

56
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,159
wrong I was seeing people posting

57
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,990
pictures of 110 112 and I think somebody

58
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,240
posted a hundred and 18 degrees out

59
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,650
there people are out there smoking hash

60
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,960
and watching music and having a good

61
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,550
time

62
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,930
better people than me [ __ ] that I don't

63
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,580
want to go play when it's 118 degrees

64
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,840
all I want to do is turn on the

65
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,310
air-conditioner and stay the [ __ ] inside

66
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,530
I don't even want to mess around with

67
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,460
118 that does not sound like a good idea

68
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,250
at all

69
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,780
I am super pale for some reasons when I

70
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,879
go out in the Sun I'm like I'm almost

71

gingery my beard comes in red but my

72
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,930
hair is blonde but uh when I go out in

73
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,519
the Sun I just burn and just roast I'll

74
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,650
turn bright red and then I'll peel

75
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,060
sometimes and then the next day I'm not

76
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,439

77
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,409
shitty I don't get a Sun Tan or anything

96
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,659

male from the arize his name is Solomon

98
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:43,680
I named him King Solomon on June 18th I

99
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,530
used King Solomon to pollinate a

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,189
redheaded stranger a proto Geum from

101
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,860
Ethos genetics a Flo Kalonji Kush

chefs oh geez white widow platinum tangi

105
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,430
chem for Jack flash

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,409
critical mass and a whole bunch of other

107
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,040
stuff anyway I pollinated them on the

108
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,079
18th

109
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,379
today it is let's look down and see what

110
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,060
the date is today as 7:13 as I record so

111
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,509
that means they were pollinated almost a

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,789
month ago

113
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,980
the seeds are forming the seeds are fat

114
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,079
I can see the seeds in the buds you

115
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,189
don't need any sort of assistance to see

116
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,620
them the buds are swollen

117
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,139
swell swollen up with seeds that was

118
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,728
harder to say than it looked but I'm

119
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,189
very excited they should be done

120
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,539
somewhere between two and four weeks I'm

121
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,800
probably gonna let them go the

122
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,569
four weeks to make sure that they are

123
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,069
done the only problem with letting seeds

124
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,659
go too long is sometimes they get a

125
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,699
little too hard and they don't germinate

126
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,110
well I'm none of these that are being

127
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,180
made out of this batch you're going to

128
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,620
market these are all for myself I've got

129
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,990
plenty of other things that are

130
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,459
available for market but yeah that's

131
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,829
where this breeding project is honestly

132
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,449
something I don't know why I was really

133
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,029
excited about the Platinum tangi to

134
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,289
arise I want to put that orange flavor

135
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:58,919
but since I've been watching it happen

136
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,900
the Kim for a Ryze combination has just

137
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,699
been making me more and more excited and

138
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,589
also I'm growing the Kim for in the

139
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,680
commercial grower at Three Rivers and it

140
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:08,909
just gets huge and chunky and stinks so

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,040
it's been getting me excited so I'm

142
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,240
excited about the rise to Kim for but

143
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,040
there's gonna be a lot of cool new [ __ ]

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
coming up the seeds are getting huge you

145
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,879
can see them in there you guys they're

146
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,189
not quite turning dark yet they're white

147
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,509
they're going kind of grayish they'll go

148
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,829
white then the kind of this grayish

149
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,180
color and then they'll turn the green

150
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,349
and it'll start turning that

151
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,329
tiger-stripe thing and that's when

152
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,040
they're done they're kind of doing the

153
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:31,169
first transition part they're getting

154
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,330
there they're there almost starting to

155
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,520
be like real seeds all right so that's

156
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:36,449
an update on the breeding project thanks

157
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,579

name ideas I'm working on new strains

161
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,389
all the time I have a couple of new

162
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,120
strains that could use names those

163
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,069
strains have been Flo cross to the arize

the podcast that's right if you feel

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,910
like this podcast is worth a couple of

187
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,910
bucks of your time you can go to

188
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,910
patreon.com/scishow

189
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,959
begging for money but if you feel like

190
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,219
the show is worth a couple of bucks I

191
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,509
would love it if you threw them my

192
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,430
direction what I will do with those

193
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,349
couple of dollars is I will keep my

194
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,629
website up that hosts this podcast my

195
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,129
website is Irie genetics Colorado calm

196
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,230
it looks like [ __ ] right now I apologize

197
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,719
I focus more on the podcast and more on

198
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,939
like grows then I do the website but the

199
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,800
point is the podcast webpage is where

200
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,509
the podcast is hosted so I have to keep

201
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,759
the webpage alive that's where the

202
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,139
podcast goes it goes into an RSS feed

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,670
then it ends up in iTunes and stitcher

204
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,769
so that you're able to listen to it for

205
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,870
free all I'm asking for is help in

206
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,609
covering the cost of my website I also

207
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,530
buy these little phone microphone covers

208
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,240
for when people come over I do a few

209
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,129

your email on a future episode I know a

332
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,229
lot of people have sent me emails and

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,789
they're gonna say what the hell dude I

334
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,170
sent you a message a long time ago you

335
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,998
still haven't read it I get a lot of

336
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,378
emails like I said I'm working my way

337
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,430
through it and I'm getting caught up now

338
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,350
that I bought the printer and I've been

339
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,328
printing out the messages it's so much

340
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,069
easier so your chances are getting much

341
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,799
higher that your message will be read on

342
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:49,808
the show so let's start with this one

343
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,519
right here this one comes from a person

344
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:54,249
who calls themselves Aaron and they say

345
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,379
you can use my name the message goes

346
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:59,050
like this hi there I recently found your

347
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,938
podcast and is now part of my daily work

348
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,428
routine I actually work on a commercial

349
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:05,349
rec grow in Oregon and introduced it to

350
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:07,448
a few of my co-workers hey thank you man

351
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,889
I love it when people share the podcast

352
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,998
hopefully those people listen and then

353
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,678
hopefully they share it with somebody

354
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,449
else in the podcast grows and grows and

355
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:15,669
grows that's how it works oh thank you

356
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,799
for that ah then he says now on to the

357
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:20,049
questions I've got a bunch but we'll

358
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,248
only throw a few at you now hey I look

359
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,628
forward to the other questions

360
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:24,308
Aaron how you say you've got more

361
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,079
questions I want to hear them so shoot

362
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:28,448
it my way then you say recently you

363
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,729
talked about doing a scrog a screen of

364
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,438
green and your commercial grows how do

365
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,259
you work that into a perpetual cycle

366
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:37,208
also I'm having issues with russet mites

367
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,009
and route a fits what can I do to get

368
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,748
rid of them the more organic the better

369
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,360
could you also point me in the direction

370
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:45,909
of where to find a grow Kashi bucket or

371
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,579
how to make one much thanks from Aaron

372
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:51,129
you can use my name all right now the

373
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:54,448
first question is how do you work that

374
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:56,019
screen of green into a perpetual cycle I

375
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:58,659
depends on how you're doing the

376
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,308
perpetual the way that I do it in the

377
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:02,708
grow at Three Rivers is we've got three

378
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:05,799
separate rooms that are used for flower

379
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:08,109
rooms so we veg in one room and then we

380
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,458
move the plants to the flower room and I

381
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,710
like to leave them in the flower room

382
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:14,469
for about a week before I flip

383
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,389
so they go in there the day they get

384
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,970
moved into the flower room they get

385
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,649
trellis they get scrubbed out we put the

386
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,420
screen up the minute those plants are

387
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,370
done being moved in that's the next step

388
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:27,819
once they're in there we just start

389
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,220
scrubbing and then we put the we put the

390
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,990
scrog kind of low so we honestly lower

391
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,519
the plants anywhere from four to six

392
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,110
inches lower than what they were with

393
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,730
that first scrub just bring them down

394
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,430
right away spread them up our spread

395
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,539
them apart and lower them down so the

396
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:42,399
way we're doing is we're doing the whole

397
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:45,189
room at one time that's what's making it

398
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,470
work we move it all into there then we

399
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,110
scrub it on day one and pull it all down

400
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,300
and let it grow then we flip it a week

401
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,950
later and then about two maybe three

402
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,958
weeks after that we throw on the second

403
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,640
net and then sometimes two or three

404
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,859
weeks after that we throw on a third net

405
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:03,330
so that's basically how we're able to do

406
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,310
it in a perpetual grow if you're doing

407
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:08,139
more than one phase in a tray or one

408
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:10,629
area it's gonna be really hard to scrub

409
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,199
that's gonna be a real [ __ ] unless you

410
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:16,120
learn how to never cut the screen down

411
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,610
when we harvest we cut the screen out so

412
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,929
everything just comes down you may have

413
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,539
to use something a little more rigid

414
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:24,549
than a net they sell plastic screens

415
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,620
that you can use or chicken wire or

416
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,789
something so that you can manipulate the

417
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,470
plants through there and then when you

418
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:31,269
harvest one section you don't have to

419
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,028
cut the net down but that's gonna be a

420
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:35,379
real [ __ ] the only way I can't say the

421
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,980
only because there are always options

422
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:40,419
the way it works for us is by doing

423
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,940
whole sections or whole rooms at one

424
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:45,458
time I wouldn't recommend try a tray

425
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,920
like an 8 by 4 tray I wouldn't try to do

426
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:49,479
one side 30 days ahead of the other and

427
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,939
try to scrog it that's gonna [ __ ]

428
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,800
suck I would get another tray or I would

429
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,380
just do a bigger room and I would do two

430
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,319
separate sections for a scrog um maybe

431
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:01,360
you want to 5x5 tables instead of one

432
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,829
five by ten or four by two four by fours

433
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,839
instead of one four by eight to scrub

434
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:07,179
like that it would just be easier in my

435
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,950
opinion so the way that we do it for a

436
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,500
perpetual cycle is I move them into the

437
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,839
flour room I scrub them that day they

438
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,629
veg for a week then they flip about two

439
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,029
weeks later another net the first net of

440
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,549
strog is to spread them out the plants

441
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:23,200
are tall it just goes straight up I put

442
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:25,109
that net on there and I just pull them

443
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,089
down and I double their width and I

444
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,190
lower them by about four to six inches

445
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,540
so they're just put your arm straight up

446
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,649
in the air now imagine if somebody just

447
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,809
grabbed her arms and pulled them down

448
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,490
and made a Y and major Y wider that's

449
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,500
what I do to the plants just give them

450
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,269
go from a Y to a T and now they start

451
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,700
growing up maybe if you turn your wrists

452
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,039
up and that's what they start doing they

453
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,050
just start shooting up from there by

454
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,490
week two they need a trellis the second

455
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,899
trellis is just to support the buds

456
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,789
because now the buds are growing it's to

457
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,259
give them a little support kind of hold

458
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,759
them up then the third one is for those

459
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,110
giant donkey dick buds I just start

460
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,819
flopping over I like to just put that

461
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,709
third trellis in there when you draw

462
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,329
stuff like Jack flash Kim for Bordello

463
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,518
blueberry headband those things all

464
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:04,559
require a third trellis if you do it

465
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,600
right all right I hope I rambled on

466
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,399
enough to answer that part of your

467
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,170
question of the second part you're

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,208
having issues with Russert mites and

469
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:15,199
Root aphids what can you do to get rid

470
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:18,419
of them the more organic the better

471
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,459
Russert mites are a [ __ ] Russert mites

472
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:22,588
can destroy your crop hopefully you sent

473
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,359
this July eleventh what they're

474
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,740
recording it's the 13th hopefully these

475
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,730
things haven't eaten your whole crop yet

476
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,399
because they [ __ ] have the

477
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,769
opportunity by now Russert mites are a

478
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,269
real pain in the ass most of your

479
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,769
pesticides that are allowed by the

480
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,198
marijuana Enforcement Division in

481
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,578
Colorado won't be strong enough to take

482
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,689
down some Russert mites I'm not sure

483
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:44,278
what you're allowed to use in Oregon but

484
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,620
one thing that I was told worked

485
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,669
amazingly well in a commercial grow in

486
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,198
Colorado was granulated sulfur i

487
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:54,929
granulated sulfur was applied to the

488
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,429
plants as a foliar spray with he mix it

489
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,948
with water and spray it on the plants I

490
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:00,629
don't remember the ratio if you really

491
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:02,879
need specific info on the ratio of

492
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,919
granulated sulfur and water to apply to

493
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,078
plants as a mite aside and a fungicide

494
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,970
send me an email grow from your heart at

495
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,349
hotmail.com I will ask my friend I was

496
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,289
having this conversation with he will

497
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,480
remind me the exact grams per gallon and

498
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,818
we'll get you guys all set up but my

499
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,058
friend used granulated sulfur in water

500
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,619
and applied it as a foliar spray on the

501
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:24,298
top and bottoms of the leaves the

502
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,969
underside of the leaves and it got rid

503
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:29,190
of his Russert mites to applications he

504
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,200
did an application on Monday and another

505
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,000
application on Friday and when we looked

506
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,980
again on Monday there was no sign of

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,599
Russert mites so that's one thing

508
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,660
that'll work and the good thing about

509
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,599
that is it's not considered a pest

510
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,910
so uh it may be there may be loopholes

511
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,379
on if you are are not allowed to use it

512
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,538
you can use it in Colorado because it's

513
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,000
not a pesticide it doesn't have to be

514
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:51,650
marked as a spray with the Department of

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,009
Ag so you're allowed to use that here I

516
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,830
think one thing I should say if you use

517
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:01,038
the granulated sulfur do not apply any

518
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:03,769
oils to your plants a week before or

519
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,720
after using the sulfur five days should

520
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:08,418
be safe I'm gonna say a week just to be

521
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,460
extra safe um if you add something like

522
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:14,570
as a max or smite or even as a trawl or

523
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,929
anything like that

524
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:19,579
evergreen if you add that after the

525
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,590
sulfur has been applied or before the

526
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:23,720
sulfur has been applied the oil and the

527
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,279
sulfur will combine and there's a

528
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,100
chemical reaction that happens that

529
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,279
[ __ ] decimates your plants do not do

530
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:33,619
it it will ruin your crop don't do it do

531
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,058
not apply sulfur and oils to your plants

532
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,308
within five days of each other

533
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:40,668
maybe even a week to be safe all right

534
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:42,288
don't do that so you can use granulated

535
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,840
sulfur to start getting rid of the

536
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,548
Russert mites if you don't you may be in

537
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,869
flower I understand you could be in

538
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:49,819
flower you don't want to put that

539
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:52,189
[ __ ] flavor in your buds you've got

540
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:54,200
to decide now do I want to spray the

541
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,630
sulfur or do I want to lose my entire

542
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,919
crop to russets because once they eat

543
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,419
the flowering plants they're headed

544
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,650
right back to the veg plants are headed

545
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,190
to the mom plants that are going to the

546
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,538
clones

547
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,850
you're gonna eat [ __ ] everything so

548
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:06,950
you may need to go crazy you may need to

549
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,480
spray them with the sulfur if that

550
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,970
doesn't work or you don't want to use

551
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,308
that you can try zero tall zero

552
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,650
tolerance may help you out if you're in

553
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:18,798
flower it won't leave a funky flavor you

554
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,538
can use it late in flower if necessary I

555
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,548
never recommend spraying anything late

556
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,429
in flower but if you've got russet my

557
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:27,650
tip you got to go hard right now um

558
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,380
other things I can recommend that will

559
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:35,419
help you are grande evo grande evo as a

560
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,240
powder i recommend grande evo wdg water

561
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:42,380
dispersed granules do somewhere between

562
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,569
10 and 15 grams of grande Evo per gallon

563
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,409
of water and apply it as a foliar feed

564
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:51,439
you can also use as a max you can use

565
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,540
evergreen those may help you get rid of

566
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,549
you're russets but you're gonna have to

567
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,829
be very diligent you're gonna have to

568
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,629
treat these plants like every other day

569
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,769
depending on what products you're using

570
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,270
what you're gonna have to stay on top of

571
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,730
it another thing you can do to get rid

572
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,650
of the mites is D foliate heavily if

573
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,210
there's a mite or a mite egg or some

574
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,400
might damage on the leaf just pull that

575
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,039
[ __ ] leaf off put it in a trash bag

576
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,330
seal it get it off site do whatever you

577
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,500
got to do to get that [ __ ] bag of

578
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,909
leaves the [ __ ] out of there you're just

579
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,329
taking colonies of my it's somewhere

580
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,070
else

581
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,490
get rid of them burn them with fire if

582
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:25,849
you have the option so grande evo you

583
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,009
can mix grande evo as a max push you can

584
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:31,159
mix a lot of pesticides together and you

585
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,049
can come at it for multiple modes of

586
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,480
attack and then you get the least amount

587
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,250
of resistance so if your imagine if I

588
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,960
came at you with a karate chop and a

589
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,430
knife and a gun you have no way to

590
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
[ __ ] block that that's what you have

591
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,340
to do to these spider mites you got a

592
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,509
karate kick them you got a stab wound

593
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,789
you got to shoot them all at the same

594
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:50,150
[ __ ] time so maybe some grande Evo

595
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:52,250
maybe some has a max maybe put in some

596
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,630
some push from veg bloom just because

597
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,099
you're gonna hit him with all this bad

598
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,450
stuff put some push in there to kind of

599
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,159
make the plants happy while you're doing

600
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,680
it maybe you can hit them with some

601
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,269
evergreen or some smite maybe some

602
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,320
double nickel there are a lot of things

603
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,400
you can put in there but I think the

604
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,169
Grand Evo is gonna help

605
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,080
I think the sulfur is probably your best

606
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,519
bet if none of that stuff works or if

607
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,710
none of that sounds like a good idea to

608
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,680
you maybe it's time to try some predator

609
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:18,500
mites beneficial mites like this one's

610
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,870
hard to announce the and bleah seus

611
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:29,059
Endor Sony I'm gonna spell it for its AM

612
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:32,719
Bly sei US a nd RSO and I am Bleus Endor

613
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,919
Sony is known to eat the russet mite so

614
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,740
maybe you need to get some of those guys

615
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,300
release them in your garden get a lot of

616
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,920
them then maybe they'll get in there and

617
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,990
they will eat the [ __ ] out of your

618
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,660
russets I would also recommend some per

619
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,099
symulast mites they're always good and

620
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,750
the source Keys get in there I'm not

621
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:49,759
sure if the source keys will eat the

622
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,140
russets but they should there should be

623
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,000
no reason why they shouldn't they want

624
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,770
to get in there and eat so some swore

625
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,849
skis what are they called they are

626
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,029
ambitious

627
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,649
sworsky ah there's photos Caelius /

628
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,430
similes and then the new guy we learned

629
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,230
about the ambitious and ER sony

630
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,600
those are great predators that would get

631
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,950
in there and they would eat the [ __ ] out

632
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,719
of those bugs that way they're 100%

633
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,700
organic it's all natural not applying

634
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,259
anything you're just releasing bugs the

635
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,360
way that nature would do it so that's an

636
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,710
option also that's a whole bunch of

637
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,539
different options I hope something there

638
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,430
works for you if you need more guidance

639
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,319
send me an email grow from your heart at

640
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,420
hotmail.com you already know that and we

641
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,700
won't narrow down what to do and good

642
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,890
luck with the [ __ ] russets they are a

643
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,080
[ __ ] the next one is rude aphids rude

644
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,730
aphids are fairly easy to get rid of you

645

just got to kind of kind of make him not

646

want to be there that's really easy you

647
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,250
can do a route drench with Grand Evo

648
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,470
when you google grande Evo it's gonna

649
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,329
look [ __ ] expensive I apologize for

650
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,839
the price of that but it works that's

651
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:50,179
all I've got to say I would do anywhere

652
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,089
between 10 and 15 grams of grande Evo

653
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,310
and a gallon per gallon of water and do

654
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:58,099
a root drench and just soak every plant

655
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:00,379
with the grande Evo mix that should get

656
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:03,379
rid of your root a fence you can use

657
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,740
grande Evo you can also use evergreen as

658
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,080
a soil drench somewhere around 15

659
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,539
milliliters per gallon of evergreen as a

660
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,789
soil drench works very well to get rid

661
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,700
of root a fidus gnats anything in the

662
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,960
soil like that if you are if your plants

663
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,059
are more established and they're

664
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,950
stronger you can get closer to 30 mils

665
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,679
per gallon but be very careful I would

666
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,049
start with 15 then maybe try 20 then see

667
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,970
what 30 does maybe try 30 on one or two

668
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,710
plants if it doesn't [ __ ] them up then

669
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,779
go ahead and feed them that that will

670
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,480
help get rid of root a fits also there's

671
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:39,859
another product called patan Agard max

672
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:43,849
it's Bota and i GA are debo tanah guard

673
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:46,399
max ma x/x botanic garden Matt but tanah

674
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:48,409
guard max is kind of pricey but it will

675
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,450
work very well to get rid of your

676
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,790
soil-borne pests

677
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,190
I think it's organic I'm not certain it

678
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,720
is approved by the meed in Colorado the

679
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,279
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

680
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,710
does allow and the Department of

681
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,899
Agriculture will allow the use of all of

682
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,569
the products I've listed the Grand Evo

683
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,660
as it max evergreen botanic guard

684
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:11,389
cease smite all of those I'm pretty sure

685
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,210
at this time are legal and able to be

686
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,070
used the zero tall what else is on here

687
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,600
double nickels on my list those are just

688
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,899
a bunch of pesticides and products that

689
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,119
I

690
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,679
know that we used quite frequently in

691
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,229
the commercial growth settings those are

692
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,450
all allowed by the meed I do not know

693
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,519
the new rules on the sulfur I did not

694
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,830
apply the sulfur in my grow that was not

695
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,269
my research to be done but it worked so

696
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:34,460
you may want to do research if you're in

697
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,990
Oregon find out if it's allowed see if

698
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,269
it even needs to be mentioned since it's

699
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,528
not a pesticide it's not a food does it

700
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,658
even need to be listed on your

701
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:44,119
ingredients list I don't know the rules

702
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,700
about that so there are several products

703
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,528
you can use to get rid of your root

704
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,179
aphids now I know you're gonna say I

705
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,919
want to go organic and I don't want to

706
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,360
go putting products into my soil and

707
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,038
that shit's gonna be expensive

708
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,168
so you know what I'm gonna say let's go

709
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,778
to our friends at our baku organics and

710
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:01,190
let's grab some beneficial insects i

711
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:04,190
think the ones that you're gonna want to

712
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,298
get rid of your root aphids are going to

713
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,000
be called

714
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:09,500
oh you know what it's funny they're

715
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,940
called a fin parasites and aphid

716
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,548
predators that's what you want but first

717
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,190
i would recommend making sure that what

718
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:17,839
you've got our a Fitz

719
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,370
Athens have I'm pretty sure that I was

720
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,528
taught that the difference between the

721
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:23,418
aphids and the fungus gnats all a thens

722
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:25,669
have two little tailpipes is what I'm

723
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,960
pretty sure I was taught and then fungus

724
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,640
gnats are just the little black flies

725
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,159
that if you smack the pot they fly up

726
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,500
out of the pot so I would I would verify

727
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,690
which insect you've got and then I would

728
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,240
work from there and work on getting rid

729
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,700
of them if you've got a Fedor fungus

730
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,500
gnats all of the the sprays and drenches

731
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,140
I mentioned will work but you may need

732
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,869
different predator bugs to get rid of

733
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,919
different bugs all right so I'm gonna

734
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:50,298
move forward with this email man I

735

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,950
reasonable price I grow stores they're

751
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,789
yourself it's super simple here's a very

752
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,079
quick basic rundown

753
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:35,690
how to do it and I'm just doing this by

754
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,638
looking at the Bokashi bucket both on my

755
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,609
counter a few feet away from me and in

756
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:43,158
this picture here on Amazon you're gonna

757
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:44,658
need a five-gallon bucket you're going

758
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,850
to need another bucket it can either be

759
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,649
a three or a five as long as it's about

760
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,199
the same diameter as the other bucket

761
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:53,959
it's going to kind of work as a lid for

762
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,369
the other bucket and it's also gonna

763
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,108
have a lid on it so it needs to get a

764
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:59,209
lid on it and also be about the same

765
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,678
size so two five-gallon buckets or a

766
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,098
five and a three or near the same

767
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,950
diameter um the five-gallon bucket you

768
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:08,479
will put a hole near the bottom they

769
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,069
will have a spigot in this is where you

770
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:11,629
will drain it so you've got your five

771
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:13,339
gallon bucket with the drain toward the

772
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:15,648
bottom so that you could drain it now

773
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,058
you take your three gallon bucket and

774
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:19,339
poke some holes in the bottom of that

775
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:21,440
now you throw all of your [ __ ] into the

776
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:23,178
three gallon bucket you add your bow

777
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,999
kocchi activator which you'll have to

778
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:28,220
order also you need some bocaj your grow

779
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:29,690
Kashi bio activator they just need a

780
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,579
little bit of it to get it started so

781
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,440
you put some you've got your three

782
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:35,329
gallon bucket with holes in it I put

783
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,090
down a layer of newspaper just a stop

784
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:40,368
shift from falling through the holes

785
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,839
once it builds up the moisture will poke

786
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:43,579
through the paper and you'll be able to

787
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,288
drain it properly and it will slow down

788
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,878
any debris from falling through and

789
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,618
clogging up your spigot so you got a

790
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:51,709
five gallon bucket with a spigot on it

791
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:54,829
then you've got aa three gallon bucket

792
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,778
with holes in it then you put a layer of

793
00:27:54,829 --> 00:28:00,558
one sheet of newspaper on top of the

794
00:27:56,778 --> 00:28:01,999
holes then you put your food waste I put

795
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,918
all my vegetable scraps in there my

796
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:06,200
avocado seeds the shells from my

797
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,509
avocados the ends for my tomatoes the

798
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,308
ends from the carrots leftover salads

799
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,229
whatever like that [ __ ] any vegetables

800
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:13,548
or fruit the ends of the strawberries

801
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:15,319
the ends of the watermelons it all goes

802
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:17,538
in the book ah she bucket so I put about

803
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,308
an inch or two inches worth of food

804
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:20,868
waste in there and then I sprinkle a

805
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:23,418
handful of the activator on there so

806
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:24,858
you'll have the five gallon bucket then

807
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,259
you set the three gallon bucket inside

808
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:28,819
of it do the paper put the food waste in

809
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:30,618
there sprinkle the bio activator on

810
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:32,598
there and seal the lid and every time

811
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:33,858
you have I would save up the scraps in a

812
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:36,499
bowl I don't open it every time because

813
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:37,848
it starts to [ __ ] stink and oxygen

814
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,929
does not help you want to keep the

815
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:42,138
oxygen you want to keep this thing

816
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,849
sealed up so I keep all my food scraps

817
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,959
in a bowl kind of near the bucket and

818
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,639
then when the bowl starts getting full I

819
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,920
peel off the

820
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,870
I throw in a bowl full of food scraps

821
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,460
and then I put in a sprinkle just a

822
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:53,169
little sprinkle a nice little layer of

823
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,319
the activator and then I seal it back up

824
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,820
and then after about 10 to 15 Dasia so

825
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,589
you can days ish

826
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,269
you can usually start opening the spigot

827
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:03,308
and draining out a little bit of the

828
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,529
juice I could probably open it right now

829
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,269
and get half a mason jar full of just

830
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:09,190
disgusting juice out of that thing and

831
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:12,279
that's called leachate and it is high in

832
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,950
a lot of things Sean and Jessi tell me

833
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,129
it's mostly lactic acid bacteria I've

834
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,350
noticed that it really works like it

835
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,809
works like an enzyme would work for your

836
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:24,759
plants I've noticed when I recycled soil

837
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:27,548
I used to do a lot of soil recycling if

838
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,599
I would put the lactic acid bacteria I

839
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:30,849
would dilute it heavily and put the

840
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,678
lactic acid bacteria in there those old

841
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:35,469
roots would really decay much more

842
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,169
quickly so I think it helps speed up the

843
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,019
decay of dying in dead matter and also

844
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:42,700
I've used it to unclog shower drains and

845
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,079
sink drains and I've noticed that when

846
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
you pour it down the drain it leaves the

847
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,460
chrome super shiny so it's got to be

848
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,759
doing something I removes dead and dying

849
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,169
organic matter very well and when you

850
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,569
feed it to your plants when you just mix

851
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:57,400
a little bit of in with the with your

852
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,619
regular basic feed or with your making a

853
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,230
tea or whatever the plants [ __ ] love

854
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:04,239
it the roots go crazy so it's definitely

855
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,789
a good thing to add to your lineup and

856
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,140
once again you can get it at amazon.com

857
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:14,678
just go to Amazon and search for the BOK

858
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,840
a shi Bo kashi compost kit the base

859
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,000
model for 49.99 it looks like it even

860
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,379
comes with the bag of the activator you

861
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,669
get the cool little rake to match the

862
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,040
[ __ ] down because you want to push down

863
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,929
the stuff inside there and then it comes

864
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,178
with some instructions man just be

865
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,650
prepared it [ __ ] stinks when you

866
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,750
crack it open when you go mashing the

867
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,970
stuff down in there to make room to ever

868
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,440
squeeze the air out oh it stinks

869
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,870
it will run everybody out of the house

870
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,400
so you may want to do it outside if you

871
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,839
make your own make sure it doesn't leak

872
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,240
because when it starts to drip in that

873
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,220
juice that juice will stink forever

874
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,308
forget it on your hands your hands will

875
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,870
stink for ever all right I'm gonna press

876
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,190
pause I'm gonna take a quick drink and

877
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:53,109
then I'm gonna read another email that

878
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,549
kind of goes along with this one because

879
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,500
it talks about scrog

880
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,299
all right podcaster old I am back and I

881
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,680
am well hydrated I am well dabbed and

882
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,419
now

883
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,279
time to get to this next email this one

884
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,500
comes from our friend dank mile and it

885
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,269
goes like this

886
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,660
what's up Rasta last episode you spoke

887
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:11,129
on scroggins Evy foliated I have limited

888
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,240
space with the screen of green method

889
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,980
but one of the first things that I

890
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,440
noticed was how limited your your

891
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,539
mobility can be especially in the middle

892
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,740
of the canopy I was wondering if you

893
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,990
could go more into depth on how you

894
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,690
would advise someone to defoliate four

895
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,750
five by five by five canopies in a

896
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,220
rather tight 12 by 12 grow room I love

897
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,750
the show I haven't missed any of your

898
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,680
new episodes since I started listening a

899
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,720
couple years back

900
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,160
I've ran a five pack of black cherry Kim

901
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,759
and have found a keeper that's very

902
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,040
impressive

903
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,109
Khem dominant with plush berry coming

904
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,700
through in the bag appeal if you ever

905
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,500
come to the Midwest cup I'll show you

906
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,420
some samples take it easy

907
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,579
dank mile alright there are some great

908
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,009
talking points in this email so let's

909
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,539
start with the defoliating yes when you

910
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:53,849
were doing a screen of green method I

911
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,680
recommend heavy defoliation I take off a

912
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:57,419
lot of leaves if you look at my pictures

913
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,070
from the commercial grow you'll notice

914
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,289
that we make them naked when it comes

915
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:02,549
trim time there's not a lot of big fan

916
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,980
leaf to take off because I've already

917
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:07,169
taken it off by week six so I do

918
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,660
recommend heavy defoliating you've got

919
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,180
limited space I understand that I work

920
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,130
in a room that has 24 tables and they've

921
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,590
got about a foot of square of extra

922
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,150
footage on each side of me total around

923
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:20,099
the entire room there's 12 inches of

924
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,780
extra space I would say it's maybe 18

925
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:23,279
inches I can walk through there but

926
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,930
there's 18 inches of extra space so I've

927
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,639
got to slide the plants the trays apart

928
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,350
gonna walk in there I got a water gotta

929
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,970
slide them back together it is a pain in

930
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:33,149
the ass so I know what you're dealing

931
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,460
with ah the way to do it I catch myself

932
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,710
laying on my back inside of a tray I

933
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,840
catch myself just crawling like a monkey

934
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,730
under there however I can I'm 6 foot 5

935
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,169
so I can reach quite aways I can reach

936
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,870
all the way to the center of that canopy

937
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,240
but sometimes I can't get to the other

938
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:50,519
side of a tray so I will literally lay

939
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,470
on my back and wiggle army crawl

940
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,019
underneath the canopy and get to what I

941
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,309
need to get to the only way to do it is

942
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:57,629
just get in there and do it but I'll be

943
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,460
very careful if you've got to crawl on

944
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,430
the ground crawl on the ground you got

945
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,200
to get down there and climb up in the

946
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,210
tables climb up in the tables just be

947
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,830
careful not to [ __ ] anything up but

948
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,750
that's the only way to do it is just get

949
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:12,480
in there and do it it's a pain in the

950
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,119
ass I know and it's really frustrating

951
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,349
so tight just put on some good music get

952
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,909
in the right headspace and go in there

953
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:19,139
and just get it done bro it's the only

954
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,308
way you can do it it's the only way it's

955
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,590
gonna happen is if you get in there and

956
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:24,389
pull those leaves yourself I've spent an

957
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:26,939
entire eight-hour shift just pulling

958
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,290
leaves by myself in one room so get in

959
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,580
there do it you got four tables man it

960
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,529
won't be that hard it will take that

961
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,730
long and it will improve the quality of

962
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,889
your product it will allow for more

963
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,019
light penetration it'll prevent bugs

964
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,850
it'll prevent pests it'll prevent molds

965
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,990
it'll just help you out overall so

966
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,298
getting there just pull them off that's

967
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,759

979
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,759

those are for the guys like you that

984
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,358
missed all that old stuff you keep going

985
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,550
and you say I ran a five pack of black

986
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,199
cherry Kim and found it keeper man

987
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,510
that's some old school stuff I haven't

988
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,888
grown or made black cherry Kim in a

989
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,109
really long time so if you've got that

990
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,809
keeper keep it do not let go of it there

991
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:29,668
are no more seeds I will not make more

992
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:31,320
seeds of that I don't have more seeds of

993
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:34,739
it that is something that is in my past

994
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,659
so hang on to that don't let it go it's

995
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,888
cool to chew on that's Kim dominant with

996
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,628
plush berry through the bag appeal

997
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,280
that's pretty cool a lot of them came

998
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:42,418
out either really purple or really green

999
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,669
it sounds like you got one kind of in

1000
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,799
the middle that's pretty cool and if I

1001
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,148
do ever come to the Midwest cup I'd love

1002
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,909
to see some samples also if you're ever

1003
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:52,769
in Colorado I would love to see your

1004
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,970
samples dank Miley I hope I helped you

1005
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,019
out I know I told you pretty much just

1006
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,668
reach in there and do it

1007
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:58,349
but that's the only way you can do it

1008
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:00,029
bro unless you can get yourself one of

1009
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:01,589
those mechanical arms remember when

1010
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,670
you're a kid you had that thing the fake

1011
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,320
hand you could squeeze it and it was

1012
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,880
like a claw give him one of those and

1013
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,650
get in there and pick leaves with that

1014
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,300
but honestly the best way is just shimmy

1015
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,950
on up the table crawl underneath the

1016
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,260
screen get him in or just defoliate by

1017
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:14,699
hand that's how I do it all right Nick

1018
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,750

for just over 35 minutes and when I go

1026
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,210
by myself my voice tends to burn out a

1027
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,860
little bit I can already feel it doing

1028
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,000
it so instead of making you guys listen

1029

switching personality but it's worth the

risk
