Colorado night

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,238
I hate being correct with predictions

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,579
but I always say that we have to arrange

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,859
our Halloween costumes around the first

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,689
snow before we do this was actually the

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,759
third snow but we totally got [ __ ]

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,229
weather and we got snow on Halloween no

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,609
in Colorado if you're gonna do a costume

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:52,648
you need a winter insulated backup or

23
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,600
just plan for that and then just maybe

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,370
you got to be sweaty all night inside it

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,679
it's hard to be Tinker Bell or something

26
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,049
like that yeah like [ __ ] nurse has a

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,939
[ __ ] night in Colorado every year

28
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,948
because it's 20 degrees here on

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,750
Halloween I'm glad that you went with

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,969
[ __ ] nurse is the next option of

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,228
costume choices it's like I live in a

32
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,000
nicer part of town like it's it's not as

33
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,469
jacked up as other parts like in other

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,819
parts of town I live we didn't expect

35
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,438
trick-or-treaters we didn't get none

36
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,569
didn't expect none everybody knew that

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,368
[ __ ] was coming and my new neighborhood

38
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,228
wouldn't like you expect

39
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:31,618
trick-or-treaters pretty heavy we saw

40
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:33,269
maybe six kids there was not much that

41
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,780

42

at home yet the sneaking out to record a

Mike and we start talking about

98
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,609
elections and politics I want to talk

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,590
about a recent visit to a hemp farm I

100
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,209
was asked to come visit a hemp farm and

101
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,620
do a little bit of consultation to help

102
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,030
with the project they have coming up I

103
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,370
probably shouldn't talk about their next

104
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,699
project but there is plenty of other

105
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:50,700
stuff I can talk about so this hemp farm

106
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:53,939
is huge dude have you ever been to a

107
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,039
legal Colorado hemp farm I've never been

108
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,609
to an illegal Colorado hemp farm either

109
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,159
I just know have farms for Mike I have

110
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,290
never thought of working or being

111
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,669
involved in a farm that large all the

112
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,979
plants are harvested in their outdoor

113
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,599
field but the field that you can't see

114
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,949
the end of it I was like hey I'm looking

115
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,629
for this guy and they're like he's way

116
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,369
out there at the end of the field and I

117
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,689
was like that's him like yeah he'll be

118
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,280
out here like twenty or thirty minutes

119
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,019
cuz it took him like twenty or thirty

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,268
minutes to walk from that field to where

121
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,800
I was basically he was way out there he

122
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,899
was only an inch tall from how far away

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,069
I could see him that field is huge

124
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,589
they've got a lot of plants out there

125
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,620
they have a lot of age

126
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,179
massive farms and it's kind of hidden

127
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,680
it's kind of camouflaged it's on a hill

128
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,850
to where if you're not looking for it

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,019
you wouldn't even know it's there you

130
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,910
can see the buildings and the

131
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,918
greenhouses and the farms but the

132
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,570
outdoor grow space is kind of tucked

133
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,189
down in tor when you're driving up on

134
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,750
the highway that takes you to it you

135
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,060
don't even see where the plants would be

136
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,470
it's kind of neat yeah so you've got a

137
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,060
bunch of gigantic plants out there

138
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,790
they've got several greenhouses they've

139
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,089
got several barns they have got more

140
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,879
plants in that facility the capability

141
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,679
of more plants in that facility then

142
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,189
probably ten of the indoor environments

143
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,689
that we use to run the the size and the

144
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,029
plant counts that have farms are nuts

145
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,889
like I've seen the some of the

146
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,359
background info and I followed this

147
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,340
stuff closely enough in the press that

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,350
you know you catch some of this

149
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:17,839
tangentially but the numbers you see

150
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,450
forever insane a lot of plants and they

151
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,519
were huge they had a lot of product I'm

152
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,560
not gonna say where I was so that I can

153
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,788
say more about what I saw I feel like I

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,889
can't do both I don't want to reveal

155
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:31,490
right you tell us about Bob's rice if

156
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,870

157
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,810
know what the names of these containers

158
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:39,379
are it looks like you took a mail

159
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,228
carriers bag so that like durable canvas

160
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,360
worked yeah yeah but it was the size

161
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:47,478
that you could put a Volkswagen Beetle

162
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,930
into it and they filled these canvas

163
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:54,288
bags with ground material ready to be

164
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,379
turned into CBD oils and concentrates to

165
00:05:54,288 --> 00:06:00,379
go into SABS and rubs and tinctures and

166
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:03,259
lip balms and anything you can imagine

167
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:05,209
you could put cbn CBD in to apply to

168
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,149
your body they've got that sort of

169
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,799
delivery method I saw a whole bunch of

170
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,239
extraction equipment that is beyond

171
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,710
where I've even thought of they've got

172
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,400
their own lab testing in there they can

173
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,930
do national yeah they are trying to be

174
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,310
prepared for when things go there that's

175
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,840
their goal they told me they're ready

176
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,990
for when the FDA comes that they can

177
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,779
already pass FDA testing there's strong

178
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,728
odds that happens well before high tea

179
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:31,038
HC cannabis and we can get into sort of

180
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:33,219
what exactly is happening that's part of

181
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,348
the glaad you want to go that way

182
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:41,000
the odds are strong that the feds lay

183
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:41,389
off hemp in CBD long before they lay off

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,209
can

185
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,519
this is a hole even Paul Ryan if you

186
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:49,669
follow politics not a pro cannabis guide

187
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,699
not a liberal guy was just in the press

188
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,290
touting CBD and industrial have been

189
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,839
lamenting the fact that federal law

190
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,620
still prohibits just like its I THC

191
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:04,239
marijuana I agree with you that CBD will

192
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,699
be more acceptable legally before THC

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,920
because it already it is if you look at

194
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:13,509
the production facilities if you look at

195
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,629
the way it's done if we have more than

196
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,339
0.3 percent THC in our plant it is now

197
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:22,100
considered cannabis and it can't be

198
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,259
grown in a hemp farm and that's a legal

199
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,910
distinction here yes yes that's the

200
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,990
that's what declares the difference and

201
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,020
we're gonna talk more about that in a

202
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,540
minute one of the first things I noticed

203
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,659
I am from the commercial cannabis

204
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,460
environment the recreational and medical

205
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,280
cannabis environment where you have to

206
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,599
have a badge with a long extensive

207
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,369
background check you can renew your

208
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,990
stuff online by the way and it's super

209
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,149
simple I just did it it took me fifteen

210
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,460
minutes bro I read up right after they

211
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:50,839
instituted that process and in the

212
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,909
office they were like you're dumb

213
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,500
there's an easier way yeah well anyway

214
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,360
you can do it online you guys if you

215
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,160
need to renew your meed badge it's super

216
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,319
simple online you don't have to have the

217
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,060
form notarized and you don't need the

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,819
fingerprints unless you were going for

219
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,220
an Associated ki badge or higher if you

220
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,259
just have a basic ki badge the lady at

221
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,300
the meed told me I do not need a new

222
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,009
fingerprint card she told me to turn in

223
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,629
the application and if I need it they'll

224
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,039
email me and let me know what I need she

225
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,579
was just turn it in everybody has

226
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,379
problems

227
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,759
she seemed confident that nine out of

228
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,019
ten people are gonna have issues and she

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,199
has to call them back and it's no big

230
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,639
deal

231
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,829

232
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,469

been blocked from the cannabis industry

255
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:09,859

be in here I've had building inspectors

281
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,720
a little surprised that they were having

282
00:09:55,938 --> 00:10:01,789
to sign in and put on a lane you do this

283

care facility you can't just open my

284
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:06,438
door and run from a secure facility is

285
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:08,389

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,568
the name of my facility is then it says

290
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,458
visitor so let's say Mike and Jeff's Gro

291
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:20,958
visitor and you have this big thing and

292
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,208
somebody has to be with you the entire

293
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:27,409
time you have to be escorted in visual

294
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:29,479
sight also nothing can be visible in a

295
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,159
marijuana grow in a cannabis grow if you

296
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,600
drive by and you can see cannabis

297
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:35,958
through the fence they are in violation

298
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,659
that is completely illegal in a hemp

299
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,219
grow dude

300
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,139
just a fence she was like a six foot

301
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,178
tall fence and 12 foot tall plant it

302
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,850
depends on the county and if you can see

303
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:48,528
it that's a hard and fast store rule but

304
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,089
with some of the production facilities

305
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,129
especially here in public County we

306
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,129
allow outdoor cultivation there's

307
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,038
fencing rules but if you can see over

308
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,409
the fence that's not what the rules okay

309
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:02,749
these guys there are no Emmy deer

310
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,698
acquirements and a hemp farm is worth it

311
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:06,769
that's one thing I want to see in

312
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,419
practice no badges no badges at all

313
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,070
nobody had to have a badge there

314
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,719
there were no cameras that I saw and I'm

315
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,370
they're trying to say go do anything but

316
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,120
there are no cameras you're not so in a

317
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,578
meed

318
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,899
regulated facility you can't walk from

319
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:20,449
one part of the building to the other

320
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,458
and have any gaps where you are not seen

321
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,350
you have to be fully on camera at all

322
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,119
times so if you are wiping your nose

323
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,959
picking your nose scratching your butt

324
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,289
itch in your balls

325
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:33,018
your on-camera redundantly it's not in

326
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:35,120
this room you can oh there's a camera on

327
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:38,990
that wall it's there's a camera on every

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,820
wall and as you want yes it's the camera

329
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,579
with the meed requirements for legal

330
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,620
cannabis in Colorado it is it's over

331
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,569
it's overkill but so there are no

332
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,179
cameras and the fencing like I said was

333
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,680
minimal so it's really it's really like

334
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,979
a relaxed environment it's not as

335
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:59,239
uptight it doesn't feel so like crazy

336
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:02,209
and government regulate the same time

337
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,230
I've learned bro feeling who just came

338
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:09,169
from that industry and the rules that

339
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,329
the MU D has a swallowing of all like

340
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,750
watching them adjust to those was was

341
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:16,009
really funny if you didn't have to do

342
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,259
we're gonna have to no matter if we were

343
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,970
emmy deregulated or not we would have to

344
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,909
tag plants we would have to keep notes

345
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,850
if you didn't have to do anything

346
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:29,419
involving the meed how much time do you

347
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,250
think you would save in a day I mean it

348
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,958
depends on the size of the building but

349
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,419
I'm just thinking of the last facility

350
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,708
that we kind of ran together is we're

351
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:39,139
talking about several people that aren't

352
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:44,328
on the payroll right you could just use

353
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,889
several payroll there's an the other

354
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,299
outside consultant that helped with

355
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,159
compliance probably wouldn't even be

356
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:53,059
necessary there's at least three people

357
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,649
yeah it was right underneath you the guy

358
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:56,000
that was right me the guy that was right

359
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,879
underneath me and the two people right

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,919
above me just be gone because there's no

361
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,889
amed there's no I mean the two above you

362
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,169
were high salaried people yeah yeah like

363
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:10,039
when not super high but I mean decently

364
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:12,229
salaried people okay but yeah so we can

365
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:15,319
get rid of four employees - hourly yeah

366
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,690
one level one managerial and then two

367
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,800
not consulting I'm thinking about grow

368
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:25,100
team I mean do have farms need to weigh

369
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,958
their waste leaf know that do they need

370
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,690
to pulverize their garbage how many

371
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:33,169
hours did we kill on that shredder

372
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,430
I mean man-hours in the facility so just

373
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:36,740
to let you guys know what we're talking

374
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,239
about in the a minha mãe deregulated

375
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,919
facility after you harvest a plant

376
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,649
you've got all the sticks and stalks

377
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,360
they've got to go somewhere we can't

378
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,039
just throw it in the trash that the city

379
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,769
picks up or that a private company picks

380
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,899
up we've got to run it through a wood

381
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,610
chipper to make it unrecognizable so

382
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,708
that nobody can identify what it is or

383
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,629
was the MEP wants it into tiny little

384
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,278
pieces we would also run a bunch of old

385
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,509
leaves through that chipper because we

386
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,588
didn't have anywhere else to put them

387
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:03,919
and they had to be shredded and

388
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,750
destroyed we would send Brian out there

389
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,309
with a pack of cigarettes and a wood

390
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,129
chipper and he would honestly spend

391
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:12,528
Saturday every Saturday just chipping

392
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:14,240
that was his old job towards the end

393
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:15,740
there we had it on a rotation and I'm

394
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,329
trying to remember how often we had to

395
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:24,620
run it it was once or twice a week a

396
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:27,469
week for at least five or six hours a

397
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,629
sesh yeah yep because when I was before

398
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,089
we we doubled our production once you

399
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,500
get the boy originals you have the bags

400
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,880
of material out there you've got the

401
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,620
chipper that run in you got it it's all

402
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,509
fired up it's out of the trailer it's a

403
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,060
lot of work to do it so yeah wait and

404
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:43,789
that's not required on a hemp farm when

405
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:46,518
you start researching the different

406
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:47,750
applications for industrial hemp one of

407
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,269
the things that they're not real

408
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,948
explicit about out front when you're

409
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,709
learning about this is that you have to

410
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:58,519
pick one if you're growing four seed oil

411
00:14:54,708 --> 00:15:00,979
production you you run your harvest one

412
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,009
kind of way you grow a certain variety

413
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,480
of hemp that produces heavily for what

414
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,299
you're seeking if you're looking to make

415
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,310
clothes from fiber different genus of

416
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:13,250
hemp both of those two different

417
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:19,099
varieties are gonna have very low

418
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:21,799
percent THC less than 0.3% but they're

419
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,720
gonna produce a very different looking

420
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,829
plant yep and

421
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,220
you're gonna need very different

422
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,990
equipment very different retail markets

423
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,779
I mean all of its different you can't

424
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:39,110
grow for fiber and for seed oil and for

425
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:42,649
replacement seed and hempcrete this farm

426
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,419
actually a I'm not gonna say who they

427
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,590
were people may figure it out but I can

428
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,669
I feel like I can talk more about their

429
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,160
business if I don't say who they are

430
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:51,860
what I said earlier they received a

431
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,289
delivery from another farm that they're

432
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,700
going to turn into products and as they

433
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:58,009
were breaking it up they discovered

434
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,530
seeds in it and they realized that they

435
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:02,059
have to pull out every seed because if

436
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,279
they leave the seeds in there it will

437
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,889
change the spectrum of the oil they're

438
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,629
creating yep yeah so that was that's one

439
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,870
of their levels of quality control that

440
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:13,789
they go through out there there's so

441
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,000
many different things that you can do

442
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:19,370
with an industrial hemp plant but the

443
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,039
the setup to get into it and get it up

444
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,080
and rolling is very intensive they've

445
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,419
got a really nice setup so ah

446
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,759
can you imagine farming cannabis on the

447
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,379
lake high THC herb on that scale bro I

448
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,529
would love it what's the difference

449
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:36,080
between producing high CBD flowers out

450
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,539
there and producing high THC flowers out

451
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,400
there other than a lab test and a

452
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,319
phenotype right you said earlier you

453
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,709
wanted to talk about what constitutes

454
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,510
and and what constitutes cannabis if you

455
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,340
drove up and you didn't know the

456
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,720
difference you couldn't tell the

457
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,090
difference in those plants by looking

458
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,370
they look just like ganja plants they

459
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,690
look just like high THC cannabis plants

460
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,029
that we grew in a facility together

461
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,040
there is no visual difference when you

462
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,139
smell them they do have a Cherry aroma

463
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,879
that since I'm experienced and I know

464
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,910
what I'm looking for I can identify that

465
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,829
as part of what comes with CBD but

466
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,199
visually there's no difference they are

467
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,059
structurally the same they flower just

468
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,009
the same the leaves they were flushing

469
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,889
one batch the leaves look just the same

470
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:21,410
there's no visual difference the only

471
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,630
thing that gives you in Colorado the

472
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,750
only thing that gives you a variance

473
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,330
between marijuana or cannabis and hemp

474
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,950
is that left is that lab test that's it

475
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:36,619
if it's if your plant has 0.3% THC or

476
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,500
higher it is considered marijuana or

477
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,779
cannabis

478
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,470
without that 3% you're now working with

479
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:46,678
legal hemp that's what I'm not entirely

480
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,750
sure that I had put two and two together

481
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,929
in my head that they're extracting the

482
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,690
CBD from the bud material just like we

483
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,038
do with THC exactly for some reason I

484
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,390
was thinking something out of the seed

485
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,599
oil I

486
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,549
I probably knew this I just didn't

487
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,769
realize it and put it together now

488
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:07,079
they're growing full-blown flowers out

489
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:08,519
there to finish to maturity and then

490
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,109
they run I don't want to give away I

491
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,029
don't but I don't know how they do it

492
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,069
exactly but I saw several different

493
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:15,869
extraction methods out there I saw large

494
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:18,509
batches of crude I saw batches of

495
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,859
distillate I saw crystalline they

496
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,029
explained a few different ways that they

497
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,589
do it they explain the ways that they

498
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,908
prefer to do it and there are optional

499
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:25,048
methods that they don't like to do but

500
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,929
they will because it's required

501
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:30,808
sometimes they've got their own lab test

502
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:32,970
to make sure that there is no THC in

503
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:36,389
there then they've got the capability to

504
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,579
remove the THC molecules from the

505
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,780
products are they the oils that they

506
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:41,788
make the extractions that they say

507
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,069
concessions was gonna be are they

508
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,869
working with any other cannabinoids is

509
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:49,379
they they're kind of banned from working

510
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:51,479
with THC above what point three percent

511
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,690
point three percent yeah they could work

512
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,909
with any of the others right well not

513
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,860
THC a but I mean I don't know the

514
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,650
legalities maybe they can work with CVG

515
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,079
or CC and I don't know the lessee I was

516
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,600
thinking yeah I'm cuz CBN's the next

517
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,399
people are thinking that one's the Hat

518
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,649
plays a big part in anti-inflammation

519
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,559
awesome I mean so there are a lot of

520
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,120
people looking for a high CB answer and

521
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,408
right that's a good good way to a good

522
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,269
way to keep down the inflammation and

523
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:21,270
combine that with the CBD it should work

524
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:23,308
very well so yeah I I think the only

525
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,230
difference that we have decided is that

526
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,639
point three test I'd keep going back to

527
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,279
that for some reason but that point

528
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,350
three makes it cannabis lessen that

529
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,418
makes it hemp so they look exactly the

530
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:34,589
same dude they run it like you were like

531
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,690
you were saying they make the

532
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,939
extractions just like they would if they

533
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,529
were gonna run a THD extraction it is

534
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,308
all the same except they're aiming for

535
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:46,200
just a pure CBD product and no THC so

536
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,389
that is kind of a good section to segue

537
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,340
into my next to note my next note says

538
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:54,049
him CBD is

539
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,970
there are some people in the cannabis

540
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:58,359
community the recreational and/or the

541
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:03,110
medical community that will argue that

542
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:06,349
hemp derived CBD is less quality or

543
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:09,558
what's the word inferior to cannabis

544
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:12,048
derived CBD can you back me up and

545
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:18,048
saying that that's the same molecule and

546
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:22,220
then there is a very valid arguments we

547
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:25,638
made that knowing and trusting your CBD

548
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,778
supplier right now is crucial because

549
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:32,479
the place you just toured isn't the only

550
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:34,339
place producing CBD right now absolutely

551
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,360
there are countless places around the

552
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:40,519
u.s. in the different in [ __ ] there's

553
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:43,699
probably 12 or 15 different states that

554
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,450
I have a half industry right now on some

555
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,399
scale or another and there's countless

556
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,288
CBD producers that are producing god

557
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:53,658
only knows what and slapping CBD on the

558
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:56,000
label there's also Chinese CBD yep and

559
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:59,509
then there's stuff coming in from around

560
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,730
the globe and just some of these places

561
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,899
just right CBD on fish oil yeah yeah I

562
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,278
talked about that in another episode

563
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:08,859
other places your legitly getting

564
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:11,659
exactly what's on the label but

565
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,329
distinguishing the two is not something

566
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,889
everyone's capable of right some people

567
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:20,928
will believe in the placebo keep buying

568
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:25,699
it but buying Sam derived CBD from a

569
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:27,950
trusted supplier and buying CBD that's

570
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,230
been extracted from high THC cannabis

571
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:33,710
varieties there's no difference in those

572
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,389
CBDs other than one of them was grown in

573
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,278
a flower where it was in a higher

574
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:39,258
concentration and one of them was grown

575
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,019
at a flower with a lower concentration

576
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,870
they were both extracted to whatever

577
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,038
concentration the extractor wanted it's

578
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,089
it's just where they're getting their

579
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,099
source material that's part of the

580
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:51,168
reason CBD is so expensive in the

581
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:53,148
medical and recreational markets is

582
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:56,778
because they're growing high THC plants

583
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:59,159
and trying to extract the 1% of CBD into

584
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:03,700
a whole gram jar takes 4 [ __ ]

585
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,259
there was a big push from the I mean

586
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,299
when I say established industry at this

587
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,129
point in time then weren't much more

588
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,720
established than like your local hot dog

589
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,600
vendor but the established industry at

590
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,069
the time when Colorado first was like

591
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,959
well [ __ ] we might as well write the

592
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:22,029
hemp rules that were forced to write by

593
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,940
amendment six before we'll go ahead and

594
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:26,680
write those this next year when they

595
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,240
started to do that the medical industry

596
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,519
that have been around for a minute in

597
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,740
the emerging rec market were like yeah

598
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,000
it's totally different it's totally

599
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,799
different molecule it's totally

600
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,079
different you need to buy your [ __ ] off

601
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,119
our shelves still everybody got scared

602
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,429
it's not at all the same and that

603
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,559
argument flare back up big time when

604
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,750
that the FDA had to send warning letters

605
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,819
to some of the Chinese imports saying

606
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,380
knock that [ __ ] off and knock it off

607
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:53,769
with the bogus health claims you can't

608
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,110
prove I'm gonna heat myself up a DAB I'm

609
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:58,809
gonna take a dab of high THC medicine I

610
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:01,809
have got a high THC or if you would like

611
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,039
a high CBD dab I've got that to offer

612
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,259
you as well since we've been talking

613
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,950
about CBD so much I don't prefer to

614
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:11,230
consume CBD myself I would offer that to

615
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,640
you then once we take these dabs Mike

616
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,740
we've been going for quite a while so we

617
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,200
should wrap up this hemp farm talk and

618
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,509
we should start talking about all of the

619
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,700
political activism that you bring to the

620
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,349
table just before we close up I'm a

621
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,650
little jealous I'd like to go see huge

622
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,519
hemp farm I'm having fun picking it

623
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,980
apart in my head right now

624
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,900
well I'll be doing consulting for them

625
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,370
so maybe I'll just take you out there

626

644
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,349
thing but I fully think it is while

is registered to vote hopefully most of

656
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,450
the people listening have taken

657
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,299
advantage of early voting in some

658
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,660
fashion in Colorado it's all mail-in

659
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,919
elections now it's so super easy your

660
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,259
register to vote when you do your

661
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,960
driver's license [ __ ] shows up with your

662
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:14,809
house you fill it out you drop it off or

663
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,450
mail it back in couldn't be easier but

664
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,599
uh cannabis is on the ballot in several

665
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,920
states including Colorado I just wanted

666
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,049
to take a minute on today's show to

667
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,210
encourage everybody regardless of which

668
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:28,690
way you lead in the political spectrum

669
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,940
to vote super important that people vote

670
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:36,080
we would not be led by an angry orange

671
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,519
cheeto if more people voted like over

672
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,529
half the country doesn't vote every

673
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,960
election and that just drives me insane

674
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:44,809
and it's not like half the country as

675
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,329
felonies and can't half the country

676
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:49,099
decides it's unimportant of their vote

677
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,899
doesn't matter right they come up with

678
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:53,649
some other lame-ass excuse to dodge it

679
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,120
and then we end up with [ __ ] who

680
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,630
want to be [ __ ] getting to make all

681
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,269
the rules

682
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,730
a lot of people say well my vote doesn't

683
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:03,859
matter then let me have it but the thing

684
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,569
is you got to go do it for me yeah you

685
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,579
say that like just listen to Mike and I

686
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,470
and we'll we want your vote your vote

687
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:12,279
matters to us so just do that for us

688
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,009
even if you're not doing it for you in

689
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,200
my younger years fine non-parent years I

690
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,629
would identify the people in my

691
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,240
immediate social circle who we're gonna

692
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,330
come up with one of those ideas and I

693
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,970
just show up on Election Day amulet

694

722
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,940
trying to get home from work you can

723

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,419
live in one of those states you can look

726
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,119
everything that's gonna be up on your

727
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,830
ballot online you can see a picture of

728
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,898
your ballot how it's gonna look when you

729
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:43,819
get into the voting booth and there's

730
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:46,579
nothing that says you can't take a cheat

731
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:48,470
sheet that says I want to vote this

732
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:51,109
person for governor this person for

733
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,850
treasurer against a minute why can you

734
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,829
take your phone in there yeah employer

735
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:55,908
you just write yourself a note yep you

736
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:57,678
could totally do it no it's in your

737
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:58,970
phone yourself a note so did you have it

738
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,288
in your phone accessible we all know

739
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,548
where the text messages already open

740
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:03,259
that read the text from yourself and it

741
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:05,179
says vote for this guy for governor this

742
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,710
guy for a mayor and when I first started

743
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:08,778
doing this like you just had to know

744
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,090
yeah and he'd get in there and he'd have

745
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:13,369
the little quarter paragraph of legalese

746
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:15,138
and tiny type and you had to try to

747
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:20,500
figure out is so much easier now yeah

748
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:24,259
but uh I can't stress this enough

749
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:28,369
there's at least 30 million cannabis

750
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:31,038
consumers in the u.s. at least minimum

751
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:34,398
and these are a couple of times a year

752
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,919
or more people and if you look at the

753
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,739
hard data like twenty plus million of

754
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,890
them are more like you and me than

755
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,620
they'd like to admit to their parents or

756
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:50,590
authority figure like their boss right

757
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:55,789
but we don't have any political clout

758
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:58,730
anywhere until very recently and it's

759
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:02,240
still pretty Pitt Lee um what do you

760
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:07,460
think of a group like the NRA like them

761
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,609
or hate them they run politics if you

762
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:15,049
come out against something therefore

763
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:17,240
you're gonna face endless attack ads you

764
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,440
know it's coming it's a [ __ ] show you

765
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,679
don't want to get involved in different

766
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:26,840
politics they've got four million

767
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:32,090
members four as in one two three stop

768
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:37,639
counting cannabis consumers thirty

769
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:41,629
million compared to four and if you look

770
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:46,370
at our influence abilities those numbers

771
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:48,410
reversed because they vote and they make

772
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,359
sure everybody knows they vote and

773
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,400
they're really happy to be like United

774
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:54,829
yesterday about it you know I'm gonna do

775
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,269
tomorrow and vote again in a different

776
00:29:54,829 --> 00:30:00,919
election when it's legal I'm not double

777
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:03,470
voting because that'd be bad but every

778
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,330
election um Colorado does the thing now

779
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,920
where I got it a couple elections ago I

780
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:09,230
got a thing after the election that was

781
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,730
like seven in a row buddy good job nice

782
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:15,410
and I was like that's a nice little

783
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:18,230
attaboy from our county clerk but shout

784
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:20,058
out to Bell it's uh do voting's pretty

785
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,860
easy even if you don't know anything

786
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:23,509
about politics you've never seen your

787
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:25,849
ballot you don't watch the commercials

788
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:27,710
you're clueless if you want to vote in

789
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,990
this election and you want to do it in a

790
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:32,329
way that's not idiotic and you want to

791
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,400
be a little informed about it you're

792
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:37,579
looking at half an hour with your smart

793
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,960
phone from going from totally uninformed

794
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:41,928
never heard of any of these people or

795
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,850
any of these issues to fully understand

796
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:45,740
what I'm voting for and why I'm voting

797
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,049
the way I'm voting you're looking at 30

798
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,870
minutes tops

799
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:51,399
and it's worth it it's very very much

800
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:53,139
worth it if you're listening from

801
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,750
Prohibition land and you wonder how we

802
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,960
got here we got here cuz we convinced

803
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:01,420
owners to vote and we convinced our

804
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,130
friends and family to vote with us by

805
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,410
talking to him about politics over

806
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:08,920
dinner which was uncomfortable just like

807
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,560
you think it's gonna be but this stuff's

808
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,180
really really really important and the

809
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:18,190
thing that drives me nuts about our

810
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:20,350
community is we've gotten really close

811
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,009
to federal legalization a couple of

812
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:26,319
times and the not so distant past we're

813
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:35,009
really close in 69 we were close again

814
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:37,359
in 71 we were close again in 96 and like

815
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:40,629
the community doesn't come together for

816
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:44,529
anything other than a concert and or or

817
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,690
a cannabis cup right a party or an event

818
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:49,029
but if we came together even a little

819
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:52,150
bit for a couple of elections in a row

820
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:54,210
we would run the country top to bottom

821
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:57,690
coast to coast

822
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:01,420
we'd be unparalleled with our ability to

823
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:04,210
fundraise and message distribute so how

824
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,800
much of it is people being afraid to

825
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,269
stand up for something that could get

826
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,859
them in trouble and how much of it do

827
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:12,549
you think is just lack of participation

828
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:16,359
because laziness or whatever reason

829
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:19,599
excuse it's just there's so many people

830
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:21,789
there's actually a huge chunk of

831
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,959
politics is convincing you voting this

832
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:29,349
pointless if I can convince you not to

833
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:32,230
vote my vote doubles in impact right

834
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:36,369
every person I convince not to vote I

835
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:39,519
get their power and once you convince

836
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:40,869
someone not to vote building that into a

837
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,519
habit is super easy

838
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:45,219
I don't shitload of people they're like

839
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,099
no one vote never changed anything or

840
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,160
it's all rigged there's only two parties

841
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:54,759
like I still run into people to think

842
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,830
Hillary and Trump were the same and if

843
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,440
even if you don't pay attention to

844
00:32:56,829 --> 00:33:00,168
politics it should be [ __ ] obvious by

845
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,409
now

846
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,059
that [ __ ] would be different today if we

847
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:08,330
had gone a different way as a country

848
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:10,398
but well I'm a comedy fan so it's

849
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:13,519
working out pretty well for me that

850
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:23,388
we've got [ __ ] cheeto Bandito is our

851
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:25,308
president if we could just get even a

852
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:29,358
little bit of the community focused

853
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:31,368
enough to regularly vote in C I'm

854
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:34,788
encouraging you to vote if you're voting

855
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:37,488
against me I want everybody to vote just

856
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:42,319
participate cuz right now the people

857
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:45,470
that vote are angry and afraid in those

858
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,019
two things those two emotions don't lead

859
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,669
to rational decision-making most of the

860
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,108
people listening are probably they would

861
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,269
agree with us politically I would like

862
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:55,970
to imagine I either I'm not gonna get a

863
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:58,788
lot of super consumer thing be on your

864
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,950
side be cannibals do your thing love it

865
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:03,528
how you want we've got a worldwide who

866
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,028
knows but but a lot of us did not vote

867
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:09,530
and look what happened

868
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:12,349
yep in the cannabis community not voting

869
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,750
our is why cannabis is still illegal if

870
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:18,200
you don't vote for local people your

871
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:20,989
local rules always get chosen by people

872
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,878
who don't agree with you if you don't

873
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:25,578
vote for statewide elections the

874
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,139
statewide rules get created by people

875
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,789
who don't agree with you if you don't

876
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,059
vote in national elections it's the same

877
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:35,509
[ __ ] and I understand that one person in

878
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:37,510
Alabama doesn't feel like their vote

879
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,309
isn't gonna have the same kind of impact

880
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,049
that it would elsewhere or it's not

881
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:46,339
gonna sway anything or change anything

882
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:48,168
but literally every single vote does

883
00:34:46,338 --> 00:34:50,989
matter and does change that mentality

884
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:54,108
seems to hover in a group it'll be like

885
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,699
the whole whatever it's by design Jeff

886
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:57,048
and his crew none of them are gonna go

887
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,960
vote they were all talking about it in

888
00:34:57,048 --> 00:35:01,608
school look one guy can convince Jeff

889
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,230
and his crew hey you've got six people

890
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:04,608
that are all like minded that you're

891
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,039
gonna go vote the same way so that's

892
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:08,449
actually six votes that you were just

893
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,548
all gonna throw away so if you can

894
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:12,230
convince those people that are the throw

895
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:13,719
away I'm not gonna vote if you can

896
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,219
convince the leader of that so

897
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:18,819
grouping it a whole bunch of them to go

898
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:24,399
all votes getting people not to vote is

899
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:27,070
by design and depending on where you are

900
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,180
the design may look a little different

901
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,340
but there's a reason there's deadlines

902
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:35,199
for registering to vote yeah

903
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,990
and for some of these this was months

904
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,799
for some states as four months ago other

905
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:43,750
states you can register day of some

906
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,869
states you need two forms of state

907
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,619
issued ID other states you don't need

908
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:50,559
any ID

909
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:52,900
some states depending on what your

910
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,059
felony crime was you automatically get

911
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,550
your voting rights back the second your

912
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:58,869
your case is completed you don't get to

913
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,369
vote for the five years or you're on

914
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:02,500
parole or the three years you're

915
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,690
incarcerated but once all that's done

916
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,570
you're just a regular free person who

917
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,889
did some time and is now a free free you

918
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,019
get your voting rights back in other

919
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:12,579
states you never get them back at all or

920
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:16,269
you have to go through a long insane

921
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:20,199
process or a long insane process that is

922
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:21,759
also a hundred percent arbitrary if you

923
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:25,509
don't watch last week tonight with John

924
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,180
Oliver listeners you should he did a

925
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,470
great episode on some of this voting

926
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:35,139
rights stuff not too long ago but if the

927
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:37,598
fact that there are people spending

928
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:40,269
millions of dollars to convince you not

929
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,030
to vote because you're young and you

930
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:46,570
like cannabis doesn't that make you want

931
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:52,060
to go vote they're spending fortunes to

932
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:53,619
convince poor people and minorities if

933
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:57,338
you're a member of anything that can be

934
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:59,289
considered as subculture they don't want

935
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:00,849
you to vote because the odds are you're

936
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,389
gonna vote in your interests and not

937
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:04,269
theirs

938
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:06,129
and they don't want that it's been this

939
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:08,170
messaging has been so effective in

940
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:12,300
different communities and the cannabis

941
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:17,079
community got hit hard with it and the

942
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:21,910
was the tune in drop out or whatever

943
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:25,539
[ __ ] on drop out yeah culture um that

944
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:27,460
got taken way too far and even people

945
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:31,269
that are like more like me

946
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,429
you took a part of that to heart like I

947
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:34,989
remember a part of that of fighting it

948
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:36,369
when I was in college like I know that I

949
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,659
should vote and voting is important and

950
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:39,219
I should pay attention to politics but

951
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:42,159
[ __ ] you I don't want to be any part of

952
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:43,629
the system when I was younger I thought

953
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,099
it was stupid I thought it was waste of

954
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,200
time to go vote my friends would go vote

955
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,519
they'd come back from from school or

956
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,689
from launch and they'd have that I voted

957
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,219
sticker and I'm like yeah you wasted

958
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,840
your lunch I drove Ronen [ __ ] smoke

959
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:56,019
balls in the car and like I thought it

960
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,420
was just a dumb thing now that I am old

961
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:00,489
enough to see the effects that the

962
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,280
elections have either small or large

963
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:05,259
elections local or national I feel like

964
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,940
I may have wasted a lot of opportunity

965
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,260
by not voting when I was younger there

966
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,909
were probably several years of my life

967
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,500
that I skipped voting there were a

968
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:13,239
number of important elections where we

969
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,760
could use your vote bro yeah probably

970
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:20,139
but none of this has to stay true this

971
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,240
November 7th

972
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:27,429
we could see massive cannabis turnout we

973
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:30,789
have seen that across the country during

974
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:33,629
recent elections where one side or the

975
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:36,659
other really goes for the cannabis vote

976
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:40,150
knowing that it's gonna bring out young

977
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,799
more than likely liberal voters and it's

978
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,550
worked for some places it hasn't worked

979
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,769
in others like Platteville County the

980
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:50,530
last election of 2016 we like to Trump

981
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:53,469
we went for keeping the marijuana

982
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,330
industry and for Trump and there were a

983
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:58,769
bunch of places around the country that

984
00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:00,940
went for Trump and for cannabis and

985
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,650
watching the pundits the day after the

986
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,389
election like so we don't know what the

987
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,780
[ __ ] happened yeah but this is the

988
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:09,129
results they it was fun to watch but at

989
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,550
the same time a little bit terrifying

990
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,230
and this election kinda has the same

991
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,430
feel to it like there's a lot of a lot

992
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,840
of important [ __ ] on the ballot right

993
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:19,409
all right North Dakota and I think

994
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,630
Michigan are both voting on legalization

995
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:24,489
I haven't seen much from the pro

996
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:28,119
legalization campaigns in those states

997
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:30,549
I've seen a lot from the anti cannabis

998
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,819
legalization groups in those states part

999
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,840
of that who I follow not the messaging

1000
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,840
on the ground but

1001
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,829
just to two states and there's at least

1002
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:47,338
and voting on cannabis right now

1003
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:52,230
Colorado's got a hemp hemp amendment X

1004
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:53,429
um which is kind of sketchy I definitely

1005
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,170
encourage people who haven't already

1006
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:58,909
voted in Colorado to really look at

1007
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,909
amendment acts before choosing yes or no

1008
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:04,848
yeah there's a lot of important [ __ ] on

1009
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:08,039
your about not just marijuana stuff

1010
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:09,180
politicians too I received and I want to

1011
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,190
actually give a shout-out to a

1012
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:15,750
politician for the first time ever on

1013
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:17,030
this show um and I don't this isn't

1014
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,858
quite an endorsement

1015
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,619
although cannabis community that

1016
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:24,929
candidate I'm about to mention is very

1017
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,108
Pro cannabis and his opponent is very

1018
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:30,299
anti cannabis but jared polis of

1019
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:31,500
Colorado who's currently a senator and

1020
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:37,109
running for governor

1021
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:39,690
I got a mailer two days ago one side of

1022
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:42,480
it is just a pretty nug like it needed

1023
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,358
to be trimmed but it was just a nice nug

1024
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,730
on a high-gloss print just bright out of

1025
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,440
fine high time fat but a we just won for

1026
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,219
that bud that needed some sizzle oh

1027
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,588
that's pretty cool

1028
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:54,809
and on the other side it had it outlined

1029
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:57,000
his pro cannabis stance and views for

1030
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:58,289
the state I apologize if you guys can

1031
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,570
hear the dab torch I'm heating up the

1032
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,009
nail for Mike to hit this CBD about for

1033
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,710
him and then we're gonna start wrapping

1034
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:09,540
up man I'm [ __ ] 36 I never thought

1035
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:12,000
I'd see that we're a serious candidate

1036
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:14,759
for governor not a fringe candidate not

1037
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,579
a green party candidate but like one of

1038
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,670
the two who was going to get it would

1039
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:24,838
put out something that pro cannabis

1040
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:26,608
latent ly yes bliss Utley I mean he was

1041
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,880
pretty Pro cannabis for his last Senate

1042
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:33,329
run I never saw anything yes even a

1043
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,740
little bit that was a big plan Wow yeah

1044
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,838
this is your friendly reminder that

1045
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:40,199
smoke burns ladies and gentlemen smoke

1046
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,710
will burn whoa what smoke will burn that

1047
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,689
was the leftover oil in that nail from

1048
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,220
not burning the dad last time from being

1049
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,780
a little bit too cool sorry all speaking

1050
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,599
to the microphone like a damn podcaster

1051
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,640
here Michael expiry listeners for those

1052
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,339
you aren't psychic and didn't see what

1053
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,579
we just saw I'm just heating the dab now

1054
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,430
and my weak lungs took a cool dab last

1055
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,750
time and left some residue in the Banger

1056
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:06,389
I'm gonna grab the other torch he keep

1057
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,460
talking it's within regencies it up it

1058
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:11,159
produced a little cloud of smoke when he

1059
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,869
moved that torch up a little bit the

1060
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:16,489
flame hit the smoke and produced the

1061
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:16,489
fireball the size of his dreadknight

1062
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,320
smoke does burn ladies and gentlemen

1063
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,420
there's also a reminder to keep a spare

1064
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,980
dab torch or an extra can of tan around

1065
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,019
whenever you're dabbing you're never

1066
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,760
gonna never know when the torch is gonna

1067
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:31,079
die that torch just quit lighting on me

1068
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,430
I was braggin on it the other day said

1069
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,279
how good it is and I just took a boo-boo

1070
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:37,019
so we got to use the back-up plan I made

1071
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,790
that mistake with the wife the other

1072
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:40,320
night I told us man it's been three

1073
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,779
nights in a row one of the kids slept

1074
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,000
all the way through oh yeah so homie was

1075
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,170
up twice that night probably within 5

1076
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,849
minutes - you saying that that's just

1077
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,800
the way it goes like an hour and a half

1078
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:51,929
after I said it and then again at 5:30

1079
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,450
in the morning when this nail is hot

1080
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:59,129
you've got about 50 seconds to give us

1081
00:42:54,449 --> 00:43:00,449
your final thoughts anything else for

1082
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,789
the podcast now's your chance

1083
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:05,250
you know vote vote if you if you don't

1084
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:06,809
get a chance to vote this election you

1085
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,360
should feel like a piece of [ __ ] for

1086
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:12,420
like at least three hours and then you

1087
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,769
can let that go but get registered to

1088
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,500
vote if you're not registered to vote

1089
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:19,280
it's super simple to do google it you

1090
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,050
can probably do it online if not a

1091
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,810
15-minute visit to the DMV in your area

1092
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,789
get it cleared up in most places unless

1093
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:30,329
you're black in the south bro should I

1094
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:31,710
edit that out no that's true okay there

1095
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:32,789
are huge portions of the country that

1096
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,590
make it super hard for different groups

1097
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:36,449
to vote yeah that's true I don't at all

1098
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,920
mind somebody coming to me in five years

1099
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,359
being like do you remember you said it

1100
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,030
was hard for black people vote now Obama

1101
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,440
like no it's just true the [ __ ] thing

1102
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:48,570
um yeah if you feel like yelling at me

1103
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,950
for that it's at Nemo 15 on Twitter well

1104
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,080
that's cool that's we're gonna be one of

1105
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:53,250
the next things

1106
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,170
Mike's gonna take a DAB make sure you

1107
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,760

he is Pueblo for sensible cannabis

1109
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,600
cannabis laws not cannibal los pueblos

1110
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,670
for sensible cannabis laws that's a big

1111
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,710
difference that cannibal laws important

1112
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,190
distinct two different totally different

1113
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,500
group

1114
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:10,079
don't follow this is delicious that's uh

1115
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,550
mostly CBD don't follow the cannibal

1116
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,779
well you do do follow the cannibal group

1117
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,370
if that's your thing I'm trying not to

1118
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,620
be judgmental I'm trying to embrace

1119
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:19,230
everybody I don't think there's a Pueblo

1120
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,609
for sensible cannibal laws but I'm kind

1121
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,500
of wanting to start it now that would be

1122
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,150
a fun troll but anyway support Mike's

1123
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,369
Facebook group level for sensible

1124
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,220
cannabis laws it's much more appetizing

1125
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,630
it's not as awkward to follow I also

1126
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:32,309
