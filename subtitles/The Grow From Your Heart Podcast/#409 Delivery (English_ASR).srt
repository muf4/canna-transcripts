00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,779
side of the table yeah it uh I've been

20
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,429
in France for the last ten days so you

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,929
just got back yesterday was twenty-four

22
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,789
hours of straight travel when we landed

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,090
at DIA and then drove home

24
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,070
don't blow so far all of the stories you

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,230
have told sounded amazing and then you

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,539
topped it off with that and that sounded

27
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,849
grueling yeah the the trip was amazing

28
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,109
but the ride home was pretty brutal yeah

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,239
that sounds like a terrible terrible

30
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,549
right but worth it right well uh so so

31
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,560
we're the awesome uh we don't want to

32
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,510
talk too much about France but I'm glad

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,680
you had a great time I tell us one cool

34
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,640
thing about France since we got you on

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,500
the show we don't want to go too deep

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,049
into it most people don't don't wasn't

37
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,239
everything uh the thing I like is unless

38
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,680
you're directly intruding on someone

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,459
like poking them with your finger they

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,618
don't care what you're doing

41
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,019
cool and so like pretty much anything

42
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,759
goes everywhere which is really nice

43
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,709
in our conversations one thing you

44
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,629
mentioned is several times without any

45
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,059
prompting was you can smoke anywhere

46
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,920
there and you're a cigarette smoker so

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,659
like outside there's a lot of non

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,219
smoking inside spaces and like you can't

49
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,579
smoke in the museums and [ __ ] but yeah

50
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,379
hopefully every outdoor cafe has

51
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,589
ashtrays on the table there's people

52
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,810
smoking everywhere cool for you not for

53
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,270
guys like me grossed out by cigarettes

54
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,469
but I mean but it's yes it's part of the

55
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,349
I don't care what you're doing yourself

56
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,879
attitude so it should be other than me

57
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,589
having to smell your damn cigarettes but

58
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,569
you're gonna have to smell my reefer so

59
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,100
that leads me into my next question and

60
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,798
we can edit anything out if we need to

61
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,519
did you have any cannabis experience in

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,709
your journey the every time we or the

63
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,150
first three times I should say it kind

64
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,819
of tapered off after that the first

65
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,140
three times when

66
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:16,208
mentioned that we were from Colorado the

67
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:20,048
person we mentioned it to wet weeds

68
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,509
legal there that's awesome the kid that

69
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:24,879
was selling Nutella waffles like these

70
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,560
bomb ass [ __ ] fresh waffles and then

71
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,780
they just slather him with Nutella and

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,098
you eat it like they're like hot dog

73
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,519
vendors they're [ __ ] everywhere it's

74
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:35,138
awesome um he basically was like my

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,430
shift ends in a couple of hours if you

76
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,609
want to score like I'll hook you up with

77
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,200
good weed nice how we didn't want to

78
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,719
hang out for a couple hours and buy we

79
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,328
buy from some kid by a tourist

80
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:49,030
attraction is it Nutella or Nutella it

81
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:50,680
depends I call it both depending on how

82
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,109
I feel you know that's how I am treated

83
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,599
with viola and viola extracts I'm wrong

84
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,189
wherever I go so just say it how you're

85
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,638
comfortable right

86
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:02,289
I didn't as it try to search out in here

87
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,689
boy I was there I figured that would be

88
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:07,479
wasted time yeah just enjoyed the trail

89
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:10,650
was there doing other stuff so it wasn't

90
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,280
was the thing enjoy the sobriety the

91
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,530
tolerance break that's the word I'm

92
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,209
fishing for yeah yeah any wife there's

93
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,250
plenty of dude I've seen your photos it

94
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,289
doesn't look like there was time to

95
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,750
really waste smoking anything you were

96
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,938
busy and entertained the entire time yep

97
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,019
it's uh we didn't stop the whole time

98
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,818
we're there so now we're [ __ ]

99
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,229
exhausted I can see it I can hear it

100
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,039
let's move forward from that because it

101
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:32,439
sounds like I'm just worn you out

102
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,969
talking about that it is a tradition

103
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,828
we'd like to start the podcast off by

104
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:40,359
talking about what we are smoking on I

105
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:42,699
just took a dab of gg4 batter and then I

106
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,729
rolled that batter around in some

107
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,259
screaming tangerines ambrosia Terps the

108
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,209
liquid turkey part at the bottom of the

109
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:51,068
container was leftover I just scooped

110
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,590
that orange flavored deliciousness up

111
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:56,138
off the bottom then I had a little bit

112
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,239
of Killer Queen High cannabinoid full

113
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,620
spectrum extract I crunched that up and

114
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,269
put a little bit of I caught the

115
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,519
sprinkles you know put some sprinkles up

116
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,229
on top of there I took a dab of that and

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,658
obviously it is working it's got me nice

118
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:09,219
and rambly it's got me talkative I'm in

119
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:11,019
the mood for a great podcast it's okay

120
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:12,638
that mic is a half asleep over there

121
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,590
because I will keep the party movement

122
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,750
half asleep and the other half is

123
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,718
completely glazed tolerance brakes are

124
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,278
nice folks yes I let Mike finish my dab

125
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,778
I left a little in there toward the end

126
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,968
and I just passed the rig and the carb

127
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:26,259
cap to Mike and he basically I took the

128
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,769
leftover of that then he took a little

129
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,279
tiny

130
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:32,288
tiny batter dab over there yeah yeah I

131
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,929
like that gg4 batter that stuff tastes

132
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:37,478
really nice yeah I uh I'm a big believer

133
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,579
in tolerance breaks take one every every

134
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,649
now and again folks it'll be good you

135
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,750
don't have to go nuts with a long a long

136
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,370
break either five ten days is more than

137
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,740
enough did I talk about that on the

138
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,478
podcast or on Instagram live somebody

139
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,500
asked me about a tolerance break and I

140
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,180
said well if you're a medical patient

141
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,220
don't do it because you wouldn't tell me

142
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,199
stop taking your diabetes or your

143
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,710
cholesterol medication for a week so

144
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,319
that it works better one of the things

145
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:05,529
I've talked about with people who do

146
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,769
other herbal medications is that type of

147
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:10,508
medicine works best with breaks not

148
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,788
frequent breaks but you got to give your

149
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,650
body a chance to chance to breathe a

150
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:17,949
little bit I mean it varies so much from

151
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,689
person to person right I've got I've got

152
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,090
a stomach thing and I can tell I'm like

153
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:23,800
oh I'm gonna need to take a couple dad's

154
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,299
here the next hour or two or this

155
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,490
stomach thing is gonna start bugging me

156
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,810
so I don't know if I'd imagine if I

157
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,699
didn't smoke for two full days my

158
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,949
stomach might just start flaring up and

159
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,379
the little problem that the problem that

160
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,740
I have mandated for years it may really

161
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,360
swell up if I don't give it that yeah so

162
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,158
I don't and I don't want to risk it like

163
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,598
it ain't broke don't fix it that's the

164
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,579
way I've been thinking but you're right

165
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:48,250
sometimes and see both things are true

166
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,889
it's not like either one of these

167
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,839
positions is mandatory or the right

168
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,180
position I'm getting myself a way off

169
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,709
track but this is this none of this is

170
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,848
written down this is all chatter with

171
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:59,439
Mike and I so thanks for hanging out

172
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:01,750
hashtag they like it when we ramble they

173
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,189
both certainly do I feel like that first

174
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,839
dad I took when you sat down at the

175
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,180
table with me that first one that may

176
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,029
have been a medical marijuana dad like

177
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,370
that one took the back pain away to the

178
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,629
potential stomach issue away that second

179
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,610
one where I put all the crystals and

180
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,168
[ __ ] that was a recreational dad that

181
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,520
one was purely just because I want to be

182
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,709
a little silly for the show and have a

183
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,129
good time maybe I kind of do take a

184
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,508
tolerance break by only minimally dab

185
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,158
Sundays you know what I mean just enough

186
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,590
to kind of keep the the whatever's away

187
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:31,718
a DAB a DAB every few hours would keep

188
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,519
the doctor away in my my world so maybe

189
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:36,639
I just maintain that and then there are

190
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,168
days trust me like the weekends or I'm

191
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,139
hanging out going places or a comedy

192
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,658
show those are the days when I really go

193
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,848
in and then I'll find myself the next

194
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:47,168
couple days I not purposefully but I'll

195
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:49,718
kind of go a little lighter and give

196
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:51,189
myself not a plan to tolerance break but

197
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:52,870
like my lungs will say hey you need to

198
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,240
go lighter and my system ago I'm

199
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,218
saturated bro even if you dab so hard

200
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,750

201
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:00,968

00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,038
believer and like there's a line and if

212
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,228
your body's hurting and you're using

213
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,579
cannabis to treat it or you've got a

214
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:29,139
medical condition that you're treating

215
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:31,240
it takes more consumption to get baked

216
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,389
then if you didn't have that condition

217
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,400
that first bit of THC and CBD and

218
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,478
whatever else is the other cannabinoids

219
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,489
in the plant they're all going to

220
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,908

00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,139

227
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,370

271
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,899
mix this up and then I get to mix them

272
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,659
like it did it's just like it's the same

273
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:32,949
thing with herb though like sitting down

274
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,329
figuring out which one which train

275
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,530

276

nug you're gonna smoke out of the

277
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:43,089
container oh that's so much fun oh this

278
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:45,159
bud right here grinder yeah I just stuck

279
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,930
the dabber in the gg4 batter I get to

280
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,149
like smell it look at it and pick a

281
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:54,789
little piece and this is so pretty

282
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:56,769
people turps they're just the whole

283
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:59,490
ritual of it it's just so nice and you

284
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,960
know what this ritual is more enjoyable

285
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,180
no I'm saying that wrong this is more of

286
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,710
a solo ritual the dad thing but the

287
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,929
smoking a bowl at the friend is such a

288
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,120
like there's even more to that you can

289
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,009
make that take an hour just smoking one

290
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,269
bowl at the friend and so that's part of

291
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,100
medicating is what I think I'm saying

292
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,100
the whole ritual is part of it it's not

293
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,200
just I'm going to consume this since I'm

294
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,450
gonna sit here for a few minutes and get

295
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,430
my head right get my back right it's all

296
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,500
part of the unity sort of a thing you're

297
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,569
connecting with yourself I'm not gonna

298
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,399
go all hippie dippie on you but you take

299
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,379
a minute and just get this in for a

300
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,720
moment like people that even roll their

301
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:38,139
own cigarettes they'll talk about like

302
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,019
the process is like part of it taking a

303
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:44,679
minute away completing something just a

304
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,470
simple routine it's it's the same thing

305
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,329
with our hash it's like karate students

306
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,340
they will take time cleaning the dojo

307
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,259
because that's part of the art that

308
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,180
makes the karate come from your heart a

309
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,189
good drummer will clean and tuna's drums

310
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,539
and cymbals like it's just you got to do

311
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,460
the things that make it mean something

312
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:02,469
to you yeah I just always be bashing to

313
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,820
getting loud right

314
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,940
it's the same thing like when I go to

315
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,600
clean a piece of glass the ritual of

316
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,800
that is is always real enjoyable you

317
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,820
enjoy cleaning glass it makes me

318
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,709
paranoid I read this great thing a long

319
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,710
time ago that was like the nature of

320
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:24,100
glass is to break like that's what the

321
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,509
glasses purpose is it so many people are

322
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,149
cringing hearing you say that but you're

323
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,580
like it's true it's not it's not

324
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,220
permanent it's [ __ ] glass it's gonna

325
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,190
break and if you just sort of accept

326
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,560
that when you buy it every day after

327
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,650
that is a cool bonus day with that glass

328
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,769
and going through and cleaning it I've

329
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,179
broken enough pieces to know like

330
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,579
definitely don't do this even when it

331
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,739
seems like a good idea or it's the only

332
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,330
way to get that little piece of resin or

333
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,120
that little ball of hash out of there

334
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,730
this is just keep putting ISO and salt

335
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,220
in it and keep shaking it don't drop it

336
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,389
on concrete yeah please yep it's it's a

337
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,370
ritual that I enjoy

338
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,600
i buy fairly cheap glass because well

339
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,799
it's not cheap but I mean that's not a

340
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,259
super expensive piece because I agree it

341
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,359
is glass and I could be shaking it

342
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,649
cleaning it my grubby little paws could

343
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,000
be a little slippery from that alcohol

344
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,319
and it may hit that porcelain or

345
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,759
whatever a sink is made out of these

346
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,830
days and kaboosh there as it goes

347
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,250
there's it goes there it goes and I need

348
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,680
a new rig now I remember I have I put it

349
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,779
was just a cheap like an $80 bomb no

350
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,879
downstem just the slide in and out pull

351
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,069
put that under the sink and it was a

352
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,230
great setup it would sit just perfect

353
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,150
with the the sink spout and it would fit

354
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,710
so wouldn't move around and I could just

355
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,199
turn the hot water on and let that [ __ ]

356
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,000
run for a while and clean out and I

357
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,440
turned the water on and I turned around

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,960
I was [ __ ] around in the fridge and I

359
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,190
heard the sad oh that turned around I

360
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,389
was like I know what the [ __ ] happened

361
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,950
before I even turn around and sure

362
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,330
enough right in the middle is that

363
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,700
little air bubble and that cheap-ass

364
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,210
glass pop there it goes

365
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,430
yeah glass breaks it's not a big deal

366
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,930
glass does break you guys we do have a

367
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,489
topic but I think we've been having a

368
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:08,409
good time just rambling about random

369
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,029
stuff hey Mike I've got this dad meal

370
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,559
right at the perfect temperature so

371
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,929
you've got the toss for a couple of

372
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,579
seconds say some should I dive into the

373
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,989
topic or go through

374
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,320
I got one more thing before that's a

375
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:24,129
free-form okay so a fun thing that

376
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,010
happened here in Colorado recently our

377
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,809
governor jared Polis added autism

378
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,519
officially to the list of conditions

379
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:34,179
that you can get a medical marijuana

380
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,620
card in Colorado I was pretty sure that

381
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:39,389
this was the first condition we had

382
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,459
added but we added PTSD recently as well

383
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:44,199
so huge news for folks with autism and

384
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:47,799
Colorado good news for our medical

385
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,778
marijuana industry that has been slowly

386
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,409
shrinking and did non-existence for the

387
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:55,179
last couple years our rec industry has

388
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:57,909
been siphoning off patients left and

389
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,349
right so the industry was happy to have

390
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,049
another condition on the list especially

391
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,360
one that shows as much promise as autism

392
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,009
yes absolutely it is great to have more

393
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,990
qualifying conditions that we see some

394
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,328
compassion coming along the way now it

395
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,250
was nice to have a governor that was out

396
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:15,939
loud and proud about supporting this

397
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:18,278

418
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,689
folks keep keep it the patreon this

419
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,159
microphone doesn't smell like dog he's

420
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,779
ask so I appreciate that

421
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,480
we should elaborate on that statement

422
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:11,889
the reason why the microphone cover does

423
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
not smell like donkey ass is because of

424
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:15,819
our friends from patreon that help out

425
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,500
with the support ah I used that funding

426
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,850
to buy new microphone covers so that

427
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,470
when Mike comes over I can frequently

428
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,028
change that thing out so that he doesn't

429
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,430
have to spit that same microphone cover

430
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:26,799
Davin granny has used that microphone

431
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:28,028
Clint has been on that microphone a lot

432
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,429
of people have been spitting into that

433
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,990
thing over the years I do like

434
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,669
swap out these mic cover so they don't

435
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,669
smell like other people's breath or

436
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:37,169
donkey ass my clean put it like 12

437
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,240
different hippies talking to the same

438
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,519
microphone cover each one spitting a

439
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,839
little yeah after a while it just it

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,429
gets a little funky yeah you got to

441
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,560
clean it just like you do the rig so

442
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:48,599
swap out those covers and that happens

443
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,519
because of the loyal listeners and the

444
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,778
supporters that help us out on patreon

445
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,949
if you want to learn how to become a

446
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,950
patron you can go to

447
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:13,080
patreon.com/crashcourse and then time

448
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,810
let's do it in colorado currently at

449
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,500
this time it is illegal to offer

450
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:21,719
delivery medical marijuana on the legal

451
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,009
market that part of my argument is

452
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,250
already happening on the black market

453
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,860
can't do legal delivery the only thing

454
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:32,220
that comes close legally is if you're a

455
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,959
caregiver caring for a homebound patient

456
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,839
and you filed paperwork with the state

457
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,669
as such yes happened during the doctor

458
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,900
appointment so yep there's a lot of

459
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,610
Hoops to jump through there actually saw

460
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,110
that happen I talked about going to the

461
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,720
medical marijuana doctor on a recent

462
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,820
episode I watched somebody have to fill

463
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,889
out their homebound paper and that was

464
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,300
took them five times as long as it did

465
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,830
me to get my paperwork done in that

466
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,719
place that is much more complicated

467
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,629
there's a lot of extra paperwork so

468
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,980
currently oh the delivery is banned

469
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:00,240
there is no delivery allowed and I'm

470
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,379
reaching for my phone Mike if it looks

471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,759
like I'm playing with my phone here I'm

472
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,439
not playing with my phone I've gotten

473
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,078
notes in here and I'm just drawing for

474
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,579
the Nerds however my phone also I

475
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,078
ordered a new phone so I'll never have

476
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,639
this excuse again it is fifth great

477
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,049
frozen and it's taken a minute well you

478
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,559
won't have an excuse to the nice one

479
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:18,088
gets released oh thanks conspiracy Mike

480
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,609
over there so

481
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:22,859
delivery is not allowed at this point

482
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,899
there's a big debate on so right now

483
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,688
there is a bill being proposed that they

484
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,580
do allow medical marijuana delivery they

485
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,410
want to start with medical marijuana for

486
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,089
one year they want to give it a test run

487
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,480
and then if it works they want to

488
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:38,639
introduce the delivery system to the

489
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,009
recreational cannabis market some people

490
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,840
are afraid of this some people really

491
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,289
look forward to it I thought it'd be fun

492
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,849
to

493
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,230
mic on the show Mike's kind of

494
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,789
unprepared I told him when he got here

495
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,230
basically what the topic was gonna be so

496
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,759
he hasn't had a lot of time to research

497
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,900
any time to prep

498
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,129
yeah I like it when you're just fresh

499
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,390
and you got a rant think off the top of

500
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,460
your head so it's a little better than

501
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,950
giving you too much time to prepare um

502
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,779
so let's talk about it do you think that

503
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,120
a delivery system is a good or bad idea

504
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:06,859
and do you see any pros and cons to

505
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:09,419
having your medical marijuana delivered

506
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:12,509
there's so many different takes on this

507
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,029
I think it we deliver everything else

508
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,890
like yeah right if I if I find the right

509
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,450
app I can get cigarettes delivering it

510
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,200
alcohol delivered I can get my

511
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,180
prescription medications delivered my

512
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,870
patent it I've had wine shipped to the

513
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,519
house it's like a giant [ __ ] box of

514
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:34,079
wine like it would have been a weird

515
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,460
party but I there's no reason I

516
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,319
shouldn't be able to use a delivery

517
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,380
service to get cannabis delivered as

518
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:44,490
well I agree with that so far I think

519
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,760
it's gonna most of the heat against the

520
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:51,000
bill from the anti pot crowd and the law

521
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:55,410
enforcement community is enforcing that

522
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,380
it's going to be hard there's so many

523
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:01,320
different ways to skirt any sort of

524
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,420
official rule and the video requirements

525
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,059
that we have on site in the cannabis

526
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,779
industry help keep everybody on the

527
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,409
up-and-up

528
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:13,109
I only takes one delivery boy to [ __ ] it

529
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,769
up for everybody right I bet the fines

530
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:18,689
will be huge yeah then the news station

531
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:23,519
that sets up the sting operation where

532
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:25,019
instead of you know [ __ ] just have

533
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,579
some teenager answer the door and be

534
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,859
like no my dad ordered it let me sign

535
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,049
right the first dude who lets him do it

536
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,689
and gives them the [ __ ] herb like

537
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:36,269
that's a slap across all our faces very

538
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,740
true well it's not and just this is how

539
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:39,089
I see that system let me touch the

540
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,099
computer just to keep it going

541
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:43,709
that screensaver makes me paranoid I

542
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:46,109
like to see the recording I what I feel

543
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,579
it'll happen is the product will be

544
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,899
checked out from somewhere and this is

545
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,099
gonna lead into one a part of my so

546
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,480
people are worried about where's the

547
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,459
herb gonna come from and it's gonna put

548
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,589
out the dispensaries out of business I

549
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,419
think the product is going to come from

550
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:58,009
the dispensary

551
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,840
yeah it's not like the delivery service

552
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,548
isn't going to appear to have product

553
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,199
the time Domino's isn't worried their

554
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,700
drivers gonna swing by Pizza Hut and

555
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,278
pick up pizzas to sling on the side

556
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,720
exactly so the product is going to come

557
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:11,089
from a dispensary we aren't going to

558
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,679
shut down dispensaries it's not going to

559
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:14,028
come from somewhere else it's gonna come

560
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,730
from the dispensary it has to be picked

561
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:19,038
up at a dispensary so the patient is

562
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,569
probably going to have to go to the

563
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,558
dispensary already be registered there

564
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,658
you're gonna have to go there and show

565
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,298
your paperwork show your ID this is me

566
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:29,239
the first time it establish establish a

567
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:31,158
connection there sires isn't delivery at

568
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:33,980
least what I know this bill there's no

569
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,809
formal system to it right so it is fully

570
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,089
and it's gonna be like a GrubHub app

571
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:39,558
cool hey but you have to prove that

572
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:41,599
you're a medical marijuana patient and

573
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:45,099
that you're old enough somehow for the

574
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,719
first year under medical but rec there's

575
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:50,209
probably gonna be a lot less registering

576
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,879
you probably just go online creating a

577
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,798
create an account you probably have to

578
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:56,118
scan in your driver's license but take a

579
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,398
picture of your driver's license and

580
00:20:56,118 --> 00:21:00,829
attach it to your yeah whatever was it

581
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:04,339
so however then at that point the driver

582
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:06,589
will pick it up and now it's on that

583
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:08,209
driver's responsibility if there has

584
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:09,259
that has to he's got to pay for it

585
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,090
somehow you know what I mean

586
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:12,679
dispensaries are really that stuff's

587
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,908
expensive so at the end of the day he's

588
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,100
either got to pay for it at the end

589
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,840
after the trade is made after he makes

590
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,998
money and brings it back or he's got to

591
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,259
pay for it at the start of the day it's

592
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:24,019
got to go somewhere it's got to be

593
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,970
accounted for so the only like the like

594
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,829
you said the only real loophole that I

595
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,169
see where it is really gonna go wrong is

596
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,579
when he gives it to like if my daughter

597
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,720
answers the door when I'm pooping or

598
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:33,888
something and he's like here you can

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,048
just sign for a little girl and she

600
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:37,969
signs it and sets it on the table and I

601
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:39,470
smoke it later that's where it's gonna

602
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,079
go wrong but for the most part I think

603
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,858
the accountability unless somebody wants

604
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,418
to be Shady

605
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:46,759
I think for the most part it could go

606
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,619
right if we wanted it to I don't think

607
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,089
that the deliveries will hurt the stores

608
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:53,238
like I said because they're gonna get it

609
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:56,569
from somewhere there's the worry from

610
00:21:53,239 --> 00:22:00,889
the industry that I've read about is

611
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:02,509
that a couple of chains or an

612
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:03,949
independent delivery service will

613
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:05,799
dominate that particular piece of the

614
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,558
market

615
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:11,500
[Music]

616
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:14,200
like it's kind of a silly worry and they

617
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,420
let Walmart dominate that particularly

618
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,429
see the market they let best to dominate

619
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,929
that part like what the touch it goes

620
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,750
when it becomes business there's a

621
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:27,429
handful of like really large chains in

622
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:30,160
Colorado and the independent operators

623
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,990
have trouble competing with the larger

624
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,710
chains because the larger chains are the

625
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,490
only ones that have the cashflow size to

626
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,259
really advertise a specific brand like a

627
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,630
lot of the smaller stores that we have

628
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,308
in town they haven't heard up in Springs

629
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,929
and just like we haven't heard a lot of

630
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:48,460
a lot of the smaller ones that Springs

631
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:51,460
or a lot of the smaller ones and in

632
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,500
Trinidad the South here they just don't

633
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,470
have that level of marketing budget and

634
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,740
they're worried that one of the big

635
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:02,769
chains I'll have a delivery service that

636
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,589
won't operate with the small-time

637
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:07,298
operators that the deliveries that

638
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:10,000
customers will be able to get will

639
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:11,918
predominantly be from the big chains and

640
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,308
so the people who are adamant about

641
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,500
getting their delivered will end up by

642
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:20,980
default shopping with the big guy rather

643
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,679
than the little guy it's kind of a silly

644
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,789
fear people go where the products good

645
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,940
that's true that was gonna be my next

646
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:30,700
thing so I would would you use a

647
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,529
delivery system depending on the system

648
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,600
[ __ ] yeah yeah you've got two kids at

649
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:36,548
home I mean note there's finding time to

650
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,548
go to the dispensaries pain in the ass

651
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:41,168
yeah sometimes it is on Monday I

652
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:43,298
generally like to shop at the dispensary

653
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,500
on Monday there it's dad on Monday so

654
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,480
it's a really good day to go to the

655
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,150
dispensary so I'll stop in on Monday and

656
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,410
I will get my I try to get my supply

657
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,030
that will last me until about Thursday

658
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,350
and then I go Thursday because I don't

659
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:54,910
want to go Friday Saturday or Sunday

660
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,230
that kind of sucks for the dispensary if

661
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,470
you've got the option don't go it's just

662
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,700
the busiest Thursday's are cool people

663
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,829
don't get paid till Friday so Thursday

664
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,000
you beat you jump the gun go in there

665
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:05,439
and get what you need for the weekend so

666
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,319
Monday and Thursday or my favorite days

667
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,880
to go if I went Monday I would take a

668
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,470
good look at all the product see what

669
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,270
they've got give it a good once-over

670
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,400
make a nice selection make a mental note

671
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:16,808
of what I want to try next time and then

672
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,309
Thursday if I don't really feel like

673
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,049
putting on shoes and driving all the way

674
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:22,329
over the dispensary your fries is simply

675
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:24,490
half time I made just take that delivery

676
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,419
of my last order exactly what I got you

677
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,370
know what I mean just remember what I

678
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,930
got the budtender probably hasn't a

679
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,089
computer or something you can just text

680
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,500
it or whatever however you do and then

681
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,480
or maybe order that otherwise I was

682
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,369
looking at just look we have the tech to

683
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,289
make it super easy yeah I can judge this

684
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:40,239
with a with a little work on the shops

685
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:42,549
and to keep their online menu current

686
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,410
yeah I just jump on a couple of shops

687
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,759
before I even leave the house well I'm

688
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,380
pooping in the morning I'm looking at

689
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,089
the weed maps and a couple other

690
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,350
websites to see who's got what I want to

691
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,669
go shop for today and then I already

692
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:53,439
know where I'm going or what I'm getting

693
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,200
when I get there that makes it real easy

694
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,850
no jobs have that component taking care

695
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,920
of what we really need to make a

696
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:07,899
delivery system safe and functional is

697
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,160
banking access yes like every shop needs

698
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,500
to be able to take all major credit

699
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,529
cards that would be just like every

700
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,059
other business and that would solve a

701
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,250
couple of the problems with this system

702
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,990
because right now you're totally right

703
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,920
like you're gonna have to go into the

704
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,779
shop you're probably gonna have to do a

705
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,160
couple of things way above and beyond

706
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:31,539
but you'd have to do to get your

707
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:34,840
prescription meds or alcohol delivered

708
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:36,700
to your house ah and they're starting

709
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,399
with medical first which will give a

710
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,799
real slow rollout to this yeah it makes

711
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,660
it easy to test it though so I would

712
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,039
take that midweek delivery I think I

713
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,690
would just say send me that order in the

714
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,039
middle of the week I like to go look so

715
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,779
they think it's gonna hurt business I

716
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,460
don't think about her business coz I

717
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:54,129
like to go look people want to see their

718
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,259
product that's not the whole industry

719
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,720
it's just a little piece of it honestly

720
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:00,970
the part that worries me is delivery

721
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,670
drivers you're gonna be sitting ducks

722
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:08,710
like just bad Oh easy targets if if they

723
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,960
mark themselves if nobody if they just

724
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,690
pull up in a Ford Escape and a t-shirt

725
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,329
and Dickie's nobody knows who they are

726
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,680
fair but where to Jimmy John's uniform

727
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:22,509
nobody gives a [ __ ] about the Jimmy

728
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,220
John's guy but the Jimmy John's guy gets

729
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:26,829
jacked from time to time because people

730
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,180
know he's got 60 bucks and change on him

731
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,409
no they usually that's why I said Jimmy

732
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,500
John's cuz they go back and forth so

733
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:35,300
quick they only have like 12 bucks

734
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,730
but there's plenty of places where

735
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,079
delivery drivers like [ __ ] I've lived in

736
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,059
neighborhoods and pueblos or places

737
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,000
won't straight won't deliver yeah well

738
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:45,259
because they've had so many problems of

739
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,650
with their drivers and those there is

740
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:50,000
that's Pablo for you so the I think our

741
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,610
deliveries you guys would have a

742
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,529
slightly more / slightly more problems

743
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,490
than your average delivery driver well

744
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,349
that's what I'm saying you gotta go

745
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,970
that's why I was thinking you have to go

746
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,619
to the dispensary and register that way

747
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,569
you're like hey here's my name here's my

748
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,819
ID here's the only get 1 address to

749
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:06,349
deliver to and then that would be they

750
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,579
know you got a callback hey it's me

751
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:10,099
here's my address

752
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:12,379
it's got a cus I'm just substantially

753
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:14,750
more creative than your average which is

754
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,240
good that's why I call you sometimes

755
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,579
when I'm like a mind that's why I call

756
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,839
you for the half but yeah if we had

757
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:23,839
banking I think this would be a pretty

758
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:27,009
simple system and easily trackable and

759
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,000
and you keep it on the up-and-up but I

760
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:31,039
don't know I don't see a passion in

761
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,450
Colorado this year that's a bummer I

762
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,240
think it would increase dispensary sales

763
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,009
I think it would increase some and

764
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,079
that's honestly the best argument for

765
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:40,970
having this system now is is to take

766
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,470
another swipe at the black-market I've

767
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,850
got one real good argument but I'm

768
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,019
trying to save it for the very end mmm

769
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,759
the black market delivers that's not

770
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:51,680
even my my ace in the hole the black

771
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,809
market delivers all day you can get a

772
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,670
black market delivery so they're

773
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,409
delivering and if you want to corner the

774
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,110
market that's the one big piece that

775
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,220
they're missing ah but how many sick

776
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,990
days have you had what if what if you

777
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,400
got explosive diarrhea you don't want me

778
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,230
at the dispensary you don't want me

779
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,790
standing in line what if I'm sick you

780
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,349
don't want me smelling the jars you'd

781
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,940
rather just bring me the eighth just

782
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:12,349
bring me a quarter or some good weed so

783
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,630
I could smoke a couple of bulls and go

784
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:17,929
back to bed like yeah I think that

785
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,280
that's a good advantage what about you

786
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,960
got two kids man like I was saying

787
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,309
earlier you can't get away no it's I

788
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,069
mean honestly it's a pain in the ass cuz

789
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:26,750
you can't like any other store I can

790
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:29,000
just put my kid in the car and be like

791
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,380
don't touch the stuff yeah there's like

792
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,450
I don't want them grabbing at the teddy

793
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,360
bears or the Christmas cards or anything

794
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,650
else so there's usually not even [ __ ] to

795
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,569
grab at a dispensary but you're not

796
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,360
allowed to take your kids in you're also

797
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:42,589
like hey if you're a decent person in

798
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,389
like

799
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,230
CPS if they found out would definitely

800
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,059
not appreciate

801
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,669
just leaving the kids in the parking lot

802
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,369
for [ __ ] 40 minutes while waiting in

803
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,490
line and waiting to shop and you there

804
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:57,319
way too young for that [ __ ]

805
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,929
so if minimum I have to either have

806
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,638
someone to watch the kids or someone to

807
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,679
sit in the car with the kids um there's

808
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:05,629
two of them and so they're gonna murder

809
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,470
you chose an S at the end of that yeah

810
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,760
that's mischief it's so it's just kind

811
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,139
of a pain like I have to find a good

812
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,119
spot to do it so when I go to the

813
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:16,250
dispensary now I'm getting like three or

814
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,538
four weeks worth the product just that I

815
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,269
don't have to figure out how to get away

816
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:22,609
for another hour and forty again during

817
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:24,679
business hours during but yeah like this

818
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:26,209
podcast happens late at night folks is

819
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,370
the only way we're able to get this done

820
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,200
what's wacky to me is that if we go to a

821
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,479
park aeri the dispensary four and a half

822
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,950
miles from here they have one entrance

823
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,110
where you walk into the lobby and then

824
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,730
you see the reception person the intake

825
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,528
person I don't know the appropriate word

826
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,690
for that it's 2019 I'm sure that there's

827
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:43,369
a better word now I'm trying to use it

828
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,409
whatever word that is you walk and you

829
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,119
say hi to the marvelous person that

830
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,950
greets you and then you either are a

831
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,388
medical or a recreational shopper if

832
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,720
you're rec you go on one side of the

833
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,099
store

834
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,450
if you're medical you go on the other

835
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:57,079
side of the store it's two different

836
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,819
shopping experiences for some reason we

837
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:01,038
have voted that the medical side is open

838
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:03,439
until 7 p.m. and the recreational side

839
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,558
is open until 11:00 so if I smoke

840
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,509
cannabis after seven I'm like a [ __ ]

841
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,668
gremlin right it's like a Mogwai it

842
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:12,288
becomes recreational if I started

843
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:13,970
smoking weed after seven o'clock and I

844
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:16,339
get high but if I smoke it before seven

845
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,100
and I'm just medicating I don't know why

846
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:24,619
those it's pretty funny are it's kind of

847
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:26,898
silly yeah I find it silly yep it's it's

848

those little little tidbits that I'm

849
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:33,678
useful for leisure usable for something

850
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,089
but I don't have to there's a bunch of

851
