8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,399
up for us in today's podcast I'm going

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,079
to give away free seeds hang out we'll

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,679
talk more about those free seeds later

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,079
on in today's show before we get too far

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,479

too much time with advertising here at

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,878
the start of the show let's work our way

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,799
into the question and answer portion of

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,118
today's podcast I do have a website that

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,200
website is iry genetics.com on the top

24
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,159
of that website there's a row of tabs

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,560
one of those tabs does say grow help or

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,680
grow questions if you click on that tab

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,439
you can send me a grow question if I

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,560
read your grow question here on the

29
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,959
podcast I will send you a coupon code

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,439
for a free pack of seeds at idirect

31
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,438
tocom our first question came from a new

32
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,078
friend who did not send a name their

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,719
question says wagan rosta Jeff big UPS

34
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,279
on so many hundreds of podcasts bro

35
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,478
thank you for the congratulations on all

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,879
of the podcast 866 episodes and no sign

37
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,679
of slowing down or stopping so thank you

38
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,359
for that thank you for noticing we're

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
going to jump right to the question part

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,920
there's a lot of a little setup here

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,840
we're going to get right to the question

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,599
it says anyway my question is this when

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,920
flipping back to 186 in the last 2 weeks

44
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,679
or 10 days won't the tri coms just be

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,560
ripe and immature many thanks big man

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,000
all right so this question is referring

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,640
to a technique that I've been talking

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
about that gets a lot of feedback a lot

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,518
of response and a lot of controversy I

50
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,439
have been using a technique where at the

51
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,519
end of my flowering cycle so I've been

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,598
flowering for seven eight and 1 half

53
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,519
maybe nine weeks for the last 10 maybe

54
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,878
14 days of my flowering cycle I change

55
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,319
my timer from 18 hours on to 6 hours off

56
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,079
now a lot of people's heads just [ __ ]

57
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,958
exploded why would you do this what is

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,840
going on you're in flower why are you

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,800
putting those lights back on a a

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
vegetative light cycle essentially

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,959
that's a very good question I do have a

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
very good reason for doing this so

63
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,598
essentially what I'm doing and there are

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,120
a lot of questions that come with this

65
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,158
I'll try to address a couple of those as

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,360
we talk uh but so I turn so 10 days

67
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,079
before I going to harvest generally 10

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
days before Harvest and do this with the

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,959
cultivar you are familiar with don't do

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,680
this on the first time you've ran a

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,680
plant because you don't know how long it

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,360
goes do this with with a plant you know

73
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,319
how long it goes and then adjust your

74
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,040
schedule accordingly so if you have a

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,000
plant you've ran it multiple times it

76
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,400
goes 70 days at day 60 I would change my

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,439
light cycle from 12 hours on 12 hours

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,599
off back to 18 hours on and 6 hours off

79
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,158
a vegetative light cycle I'm increasing

80
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,919
my light by 50% per day a lot of people

81
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,318
like I said are freaking the [ __ ] out

82
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,639
why would you do that well the first

83
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,560
reason I want to do that is I have found

84
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,559
that it makes my plants finish a little

85
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,920
bit more quickly I can get them to speed

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,158
up by several days sometimes two three

87
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,518
maybe four or five days depending on the

88
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,959
cultivar also I have noticed that it

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,719
increases in Bud density it makes the

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,120
buds a little more bulky a little bit

91
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,840
more dense and it also makes them weigh

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,840
a little bit more so it's making them

93
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,719
finish faster and it's making them more

94
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,799
dense I have never in my whole teaching

95
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,919
about this whole method I have never

96
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,760
said um that we should get more tricomes

97
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,598
from this that's never been part of the

98
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,000
theory part of the practice Ice uh

99
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,438
that's never been the idea because I

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
agree with you if this did promote

101
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,438
tricomes those tricomes would be

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,239
premature not immature but premature

103
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,799
troms they wouldn't be ripe they

104
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,120
wouldn't be worth smoking so you're

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,159
right there would be no advantage to

106
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,478
that also I feel like that the Bro

107
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:18,719
Science of putting your plants in

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,918
darkness for 24 hours to achieve more

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
tricomes uh that would do the exact same

110
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,599
thing you would get more tricomes but

111
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,399
they would not be uh they would not be

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,680
ripe they would not be amber in color

113
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,279
they would not be filled with the proper

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,918
oils they wouldn't be ready when I

115
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,079
started telling everybody about this

116
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,319
technique the intention was never to

117
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,680
encourage or increase or promote triome

118
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,759
development this was always about Bud

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
development about Bud density and

120
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,319
speeding up the uh the finishing time I

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,160
learned this technique and started doing

122
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,038
this uh with seated crops when I

123
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
pollinate crops I put them back on 186

124
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,719
very quickly after pollination because

125
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,559
that light source gives my plants more

126
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,639
energy and I wanted my seeds to get more

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,360
robust more quickly and then I thought

128
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,639
if it works on my seeds why not do it on

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
the flowering crops however we can't do

130
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,319
it too early because they will rev if

131
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,038
you do this too early so I learned to do

132
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,639
this the last 10 days of the flowering

133
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,719
cycle and it does make my buds uh more

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
dense and they finish more quickly so

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,440
from the very beginning this was never

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,478
intended to uh increase or promote

137
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,038
triome development that's the the bottom

138
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,038
line of this question it's only been for

139
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,159
Bud density and to speed up the Harvest

140
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,719
Time of that plant now a lot of people

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
ask me a lot of different questions they

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,880
ask how do you do this why do you do

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
this when do you do this I I will

144
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,719
explain uh very simply and very quickly

145
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,079
and very uh much why I do this it's

146
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
really easy um like I said before we've

147
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,839
got a plant that we have grown several

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,680
times we know what this plant does if

149
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,159
you harvest this plant consistently at

150
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,759
Day 70 and you have a solid outcome that

151
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,080
you're happy with um I would say turn

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,080
that light at day 60 put the light back

153
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:57,079
on 186 and allow that plant to get that

154
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:59,198
50% more Photon energy in my opinion um

155
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,120
in my experience in my education light

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
is the number one source of energy for

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,879
our plants so giving that plant more

158
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
light more energy will allow it to grow

159
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,319
more quickly it will get more density

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,240
and it will finish even sooner because

161
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,080
it is photosynthesizing more

162
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,199
metabolizing more while those lights are

163
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,519
on it is getting the energy to do so

164
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,240
while the lights are on and it will do

165
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,598
those processes when the lights go off

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,439
with more Vigor I also use green

167
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,279
sensation to make these processes a

168
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,560
little bit easier on the plant so we're

169
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,359
doing 186 adding green sensation green

170
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,199
sensation comes in at week four but it

171
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,800
sticks around so uh the reason for

172
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,720
changing the light is I believe that

173
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,120
that light gives me more Photon energy

174
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,680
that Photon energy is more production

175
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,639
people are going to ask do you change

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,199
the intensity of the lights no I simply

177
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,720
change the timer nothing changes but the

178
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,520
timer I don't adjust the intensity I

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,840
don't go less I don't go more I go more

180
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,120
hours that is all that I do and I highly

181
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,038
recommend that you do this with the

182
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,560
plant that you know how long it takes to

183
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,878
flower I keep saying that because you

184
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,000
may be wasting potential or you may be

185
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,639
triggering issues find a plan that you

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
know how long it takes to flower that

187
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,879
you're satisfied with the outcome if you

188
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
flush that's a whole another topic I

189
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,840
don't really flush that's not something

190
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,239
I do if you flush during that flush

191
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,079
phase go back to 186 that will speed up

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,120
the ripening uh and it'll give you more

193
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,878
dense buds but this was never meant to

194
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,879
be about triome production so I don't

195
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,000
want that to be a confusion the number

196
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,039
one question I get around this is when

197
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,478
to do it 10 days before flower the uh

198
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,719
number two question I get is do you

199
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,959
change the light intensity no leave it

200
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,840
right how it is change the timer keep an

201
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,560
eye on the plants third question I get

202
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,359
is won't this make my plants rev yes if

203
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,120
you do it for 18 22 days then they will

204
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,000
rev but 10 days they will not rev if

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,038
they do you've got a problematic plant

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,240
and that plant was going to give you

207
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,279
some [ __ ] anyway and if you are looking

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,639
to work on a reveg project now you are

209
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,478
way ahead of the game because you've

210
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,158
been in the reveg light it's already

211
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,439
been receiving that light it knows I'm

212
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,360
in 186 it's starting to do stuff

213
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,038
hormonally so when you do harvest the

214
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,598
lowers and leave a couple lower buds you

215
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,120
are way ahead of the game for your reveg

216
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,719
project so my dude who did not send a

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,639

all right this question for my new

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,158
friend Matthew goes a little bit like

235
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,800
this it says hey rosta Jeff I was

236
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:47,159
listening to your podcast and that got

237
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,399
me looking at your seeds and I want to

238
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,600
ask a question about them I appreciate

239
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,600
that it says are your feminized seeds

240
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,360
self-pollinated that is kind of a trick

241
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,519
question we'll get into that it says

242
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,839
will their genetics be similar to the

243
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,360
seedling mother other or can they still

244
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,399
have a fair bit of variance all right so

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,919
I want to talk about that um are the

246
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,799
seeds self-pollinated now if they were

247
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,838
self-pollinated you could only make one

248
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:15,240
strain so what I do I take one female

249
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,040
plant and I treat that female plant with

250
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,480
a solution we're going to talk about

251
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,039
that at another time I've talked about

252
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,159
it a lot in the past I take this female

253
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,679
plant I treat it with the solution it

254
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,199
creates pollen that only contains female

255
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,879
chromosomes because it is a female plant

256
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,560
I then take that poll

257
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,559
and I can put that pollen on a clone of

258
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,958
the same plant and that would be

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,078
considered a self-pollination that is an

260
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,199
S1 that plant definitely is

261
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,120
self-pollinated when I take that pollen

262
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,720
and put that pollen on other plants to

263
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,278
create other outcrosses those are what

264
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
is known as a reversal an R1 or an R2 if

265
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,639
it's a further filial but we're getting

266
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,679
carried away so we've got a difference

267
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,919
between a self and a reversal is what

268
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,958
you're basically talking about here some

269
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,599
of my plants are

270
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,799
self-pollinated um Golden Goat is a

271
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,159
self-pollination Golden Goat is a Golden

272
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,120
Goat clone pollinating a Golden Goat

273
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,000
clone so you are getting pure

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,159
unadulterated Golden Goat that's what

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,879
you get with that lemon Jeffrey on the

276
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,879
other hand is the Golden Goat pollen put

277
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,159
on a Lemon Skunk female that's how we

278
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,559
make the lemon Jeffree so that is a

279
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,480
reversal it is the female pollen put on

280
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,119
the lemon Jeffrey that makes the lemon

281
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,079
Jeffree that makes a feminized seed

282
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
because of that feminized pollen so

283
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,039
we've You' got two different types of uh

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,959
breeding projects here two types of

285
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,199
feminized breeding projects one is a

286
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,479
self one is a reversal let's talk about

287
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,680
the second part of this question will

288
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,079
their genetics be similar to the seeding

289
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,799
mother or can they still have a fair bit

290
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,199
of variance that's a very good question

291
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,199
let's focus first with the Golden Goat

292
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,079
S1 the self Golden Goat what I see with

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,680
the Golden Goat a lot of the times I see

294
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,319
about 40% of the phenotypes look just

295
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,000
like the original mother 40% of them

296
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,440
look just like the original mom then

297
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,240
there's about

298
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,639
25% that look a little bit like one of

299
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,320
the parents on one side the father then

300
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,240
there's about 25% of The Offspring that

301
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,879
look like the mother so we've got 25 dad

302
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,680
25 Mom that's 50% we got 40% that looks

303
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,838
just like the Golden Goat and then

304
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,879
there's 10% of them that are just

305
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,800
[ __ ] random weirdos there's a

306
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,240
phenotype in there that grows real tall

307
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,278
real skinny real wispy it takes a real

308
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,560
long time to finish but it is the most

309
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,519
potent out of the batch it doesn't look

310
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,838
anything like the original golden go but

311
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,519
it is amazingly potent and it tastes

312
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,600
like a tart sour funky grapefruit and it

313
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,440
makes my head spin when I smoke it so

314
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,920
that phenotype is in there but that is

315
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,480
not the common phenotype that is a

316
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,639
little bit of an outlier like I said

317
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,720
that's probably 10% I'm going to even

318
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,799
narrow it down to say probably 5% of the

319
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,120
phenotypes will Express that the other

320
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,278
five are just going to be weirdos that

321
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm not even sure what you're going to

322
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,838
get so approximately 40% of The

323
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
Offspring are going to look just like

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,560
the mother just like the Golden Goat

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
clone that I've got that we started with

326
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,559
25% are going to look kind of like Mom

327
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,838
25% are going to look kind of like Dad

328
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,278
5% [ __ ] weirdos and 5% make that real

329
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,880
tall lanky wild [ __ ] phenotype that

330
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm talking about so that's what you're

331
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,600
going to see from the S1 from the Golden

332
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,480
Goat now let's talk more about the R1 um

333
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,480
we're going to focus again on the lemon

334
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Jeffrey lemon Jeffrey um there's one

335
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,680
common fenot type that you can see a

336
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,959
perfect 50/50 mix of the lemon skunk and

337
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,919
the Golden Goat that is kind of the

338
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,159
common phenotype and once again I'm

339
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,198
going to say that's about 40% that is

340
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,679
about 40% the 50/50 mix uh you're going

341
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,838
to see about 40% of the time then once

342
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,159
again 25% of the time we're going to see

343
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,519
stuff that looks a lot like Golden Goat

344
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,039
then 25% of the time we're going to see

345
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,159
stuff that looks a lot like the Lemon

346
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,399
Skunk then 10% of the time we're just

347
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,600
going to get weird outliers that kind of

348
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,198
they're curious they could look like

349
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
grandparents they could look like great

350
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,120
grandparents they're just going to be

351
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,079
weirdos that is kind of how breeding

352
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,639
works when we're doing these crosses but

353
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,399
we've got the opportunity with these

354
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,759
crosses now to see something that I do

355
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,039
see commonly um with the Reversed Golden

356
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,519
Goat crosses especially with and we're

357
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,399
going to talk about specific parents

358
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,198
here the lemon Jeffrey when I make the

359
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720
lemon Jeffrey The Lemon Skunk dominates

360
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,559
that cross and most a lot of the

361
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
phenotypes I say 25 are going to look

362
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,239
like Mom 25 are going to look like Dad

363
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,759
because of just genetics the way this

364
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,919
one skews the way it sways probably 35%

365
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,159
of them look more like the lemon skunk

366
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,958
and the remaining 10 look like the

367
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,838
Golden Goat that's just how it works

368
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,078
with this cross now let's shift gears

369
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,600
and talk about orange gasm which is the

370
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:49,399
same Golden Goat pollinating a platinum

371
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,879
Tangi female more of those phenotypes

372
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,360
are going to look like the Golden Goat

373
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,838
the Golden Goat shines through on that

374
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,879
one and the Platinum Tangi doesn't come

375
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,800
through the mixes dominantly so it's

376
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:02,078
going to kind of vary plant to plant but

377
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:06,039
with the s1's uh the selfed ones most of

378
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:08,519
the time I'm seeing 40% mom 25 25 and 10

379
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,759
that's mostly what we get it just also

380
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,240
depends when we start doing the

381
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,759
reversals you see similar but you start

382
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
opening up the options because there's

383
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,720
another ingredient in the breeding mix

384
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,720
something is going to be dominant

385
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,440
something is going to be recessive um in

386
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
those plants you could have some traits

387
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,720
from this plant that are dominant and

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,720
some PL trades from this plant that are

389
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,680
dominant you might get weird [ __ ] you

390
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,120
might find totally recessive traes you

391
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,359
have no idea where it came from when you

392
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,720
start doing that but most of the time

393
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,399
and that's my new math that I'm going to

394
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,480
stick to uh 40 25 25 and those two can

395
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,278
sway a little bit side to side it could

396
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,000
be 35 and 10 based on how the genes

397
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,439
[ __ ] mesh together but we're going to

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,639
get 40% that are 50/50 or 40% like the

399
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,040
original mom we got 50% to play with

400
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,959
that are going to shift back and forth

401
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,679
10 35 25 25 sound like a [ __ ]

402
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,599
Auctioneer and then we got that 10%

403
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,479
available

404
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,920
for the outliers the outliers are always

405
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,360
going to be there that's how genetics

406
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,278
works sometimes the outliers are the

407
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,039
best so I think I answered that part of

408
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,159
the question there is more to this it

409
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,278
says I'm trying to understand genetic

410
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,240
variance between your feminized seeds

411
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,480
and say a clone you may drop in the

412
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,198
future I hope that's all right to ask I

413
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
apologize never apologize for asking

414
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,958
questions uh the only stupid question is

415
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,800
the one that you do not ask um then it

416
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,799
says I'm picking up some seeds ah pick

417
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,479
up some seeds yes so you're asking about

418
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,000
what is the difference between a seed

419
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,480
and a clone that you may pick up those

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
seeds uh I run the same seeds that I

421
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
sell you guys occasionally if I want to

422
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,278
run some new seeds I'll go to my

423
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,079
inventory my stash My Vault I'll say hey

424
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,958
I want to run some lemon Jeffree seeds

425
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,638
I'll pull out a pack just like I would

426
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,198
have sold to you I'll pull out two packs

427
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
just like you would have bought I'll

428
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,399
germinate them and I will grow them and

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,759
I find the keeper out of those two packs

430
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,278
the lemon Jeffrey that I'm selling on

431
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,318
the website now it's sold out I

432
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,559
apologize but the lemon Jeffrey that I

433
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,599
selling on the website is simp L it came

434
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,318
from a pack of seeds that I ran and I

435
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
found it and I thought that is a badass

436
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,360
keeper and I kept it and I've been

437
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,078
running it that is where it came from

438
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
the cream plant that I will be using in

439
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,399
the future uh my buddy Brian shout out

440
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,679
to Brian it's Brian's cream cut my

441
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,039
friend Brian has a grow local near me

442
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,638
and I went over there one day and saw

443
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,360
the cream and I went that [ __ ] plant

444
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,720
right there and he was like I know bro

445
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,440
so he gave me a clone of it and I'm

446
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,360
using that cream cut um those are just

447
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,639
cuts that we found in packs of seeds and

448
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,759
I make them available because I think

449
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,079
they're Stellar their standout they're a

450
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,199
very good representation of the product

451
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,958
that I was trying to sell you so since I

452
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,958
found that I just decided to offer that

453
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,479
to you uh so that you could get the cut

454
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,719
that I found and I could share my work

455
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,199
and my Discovery with you so um yeah the

456
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,440
seeds are self-pollinated or they are uh

457
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,799
reversals um very little of what I'm

458
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
doing lately is just a regular male to

459
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,120
female pollination I've still got my

460
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,600
boys I got my lovely ladies but the

461
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,560
regular seeds simply do not sell 90 85%

462
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,879
of the market lately has been feminized

463
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,838
seeds I could put reg seeds on sale they

464
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,359
will sit there fem seeds charge regular

465
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,119
price you guys will buy them so um that

466
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,798
is my answer I'm sticking to it my dude

467
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,239

you want to read all right my buddy

494
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,079
Aaron thank you for the great question

495
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,798
it goes a little bit like this it says

496
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:17,199
my question is will a plant get stronger

497
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,519
or better with each generation the story

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,240
we always heard about G13 was that it is

499
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,720
the 13th generation thank you for all of

500
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,159
the knowledge and Good Vibes this is

501
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,000
very interesting I do not believe or

502
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,880
think that G13 was the 13th generation

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,640
that is not my belief um for that to be

504
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,559
the 13th generation that means that they

505
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,840
took two plants and bred them together

506
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,359
that is the F1 the seeds that came from

507
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,839
there were the first filial generation

508
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,359
then they would have made seeds of that

509
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,319
and bred them together and they would

510
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,879
have done this all the way up to

511
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,599
f-13 I do not believe since this was

512
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,960
supposed to be a university-led

513
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:58,038
government bred project um I have no

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,400
faith that they went to f-13 f-13 means

515
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,960
that if you grew seed from that plant

516
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,519
every seed would be completely identical

517
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,400
um they would be homozygous everyone

518
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,918
would look exactly the [ __ ] same and

519
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,240
I've never seen anything bred to the G13

520
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,480
come out uniform like that so I do not

521
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,558
think that it was the 13th generation my

522
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,279
thought process is that there was

523
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,918
probably uh plants were put in a grid

524
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,119
there was uh what is it columns and rows

525
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,038
you got a B CDE e f g hi and then one

526
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,639
through whatever number it was and I

527
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,158
think that plant that happened to be in

528
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,960
spot G Spot 13 Bingo uh you sunk my

529
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,320
battleship I think that is the plant

530
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,480
that whoever was working with this

531
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,720
product that's the one that they kept uh

532
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,079
that is just the way that I think it

533
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,679
happened um I have no proof no evidence

534
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:49,599
no reliability no reason to believe that

535
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,919
G13 is 13 Generations through um that is

536
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,319
not true in my opinion I can't [ __ ]

537
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,360
prove it but uh just the things I know I

538
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,158
don't believe that in any way now your

539
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,798
question about a plant getting stronger

540
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,480
each generation do you mean breeding

541
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,158
generation because people have a lot of

542
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,159
misnomers and misconceptions about the

543
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,679
way cannabis Works do you mean if I

544
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,960
breed this plant to itself or to its

545
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,519
filial generation 13 times will it get

546
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,558
better it should if we are selectively

547
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,720
breeding properly if nature is doing it

548
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,480
maybe maybe not it will breed for the

549
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,679
survival traits that work best in that

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
environment but it may not be the best

551
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,240
Aroma flavor or smoke that you're able

552
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
to find if you were selective breeding

553
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,558
13

554
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,359
Generations you better be improving

555
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,158
every generation that is the purpose of

556
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,079
breeding if your breeding isn't

557
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,320
improving then you're taking the plant

558
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,279
backwards and that's not what we're here

559
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,480
to do each generation should be better

560
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,000
better better every time so um does it

561
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,880
get better each generation now are you

562
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,798
asking every time you grow that plant

563
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,080
like if I cut a clone because some

564
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,599
people I've heard this before some

565
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,158
people do believe that if I grow a plant

566
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,158
cut a clone and grow it again it gets

567
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,679
better each time no that's the same

568
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,039
[ __ ] plant every single time what got

569
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,519
better was you as a grower you got more

570
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,319
adapted to the environment you learned

571
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,879
how to grow that plant it's like taking

572
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,399
that plant out on several dates the

573
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,400
first date you go out uh with somebody

574
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,559
whoever it is uh it's awkward you don't

575
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,679
know what they're into you don't know

576
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:16,038
what they want you don't know what they

577
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,759
need you have no idea who they are

578
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,720
you're meeting them that's like the

579
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,720
first time growing a plant by the third

580
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,880
or fourth time growing a plant you know

581
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,400
in week six it needs a little more of

582
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,240
this or a little bit less of this or

583
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,278
defoliate or don't defoliate just like

584
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,839
you learn a person so I think it's not

585
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:32,798
the generations I think it is you

586
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,678
getting better if that's in fact what's

587
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,400
happening so the question is does it get

588
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,360
better with each generation no uh not

589
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,519
clone wise but if you're breeding it it

590
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,479
better um the breeder better be

591
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,278
improving upon that generation every

592
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,440
time and 13th generation of G13 I don't

593
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:52,319
believe that's true at all I would say

594
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,038
that's complete [ __ ] but that's what

595
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,759
