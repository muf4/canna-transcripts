275

276
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:47,550
everything every ropes like Peter North

277
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:51,289

281
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,409

282
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:09,450
things yeah might roll might roll handus

283
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:10,680

284
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,880
new products they have coming to you I

285
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,490
mean you have an unbelievable way to

286
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:24,810
kind of get a comprehensive medication

287
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:28,430

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,660
but you know we've got some truly truly

290
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,619
unique terpene profiles on a lot of [ __ ]

291
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,450
that we're looking for I threw down

292
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:40,219
something I think should be high in CBD

293
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,220
if it comes through for you guys dope

294
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:45,080
should be high in CBD the uglier plants

295
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:51,829
will be higher in CBD yeah that's a

296
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:53,210
great way to describe it I mean people

mean the 12-under milligram challenge is

317
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,569
much like know about Nebraska in a sense

318
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,888
where the name kind of gives it away but

319
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,950
there's a lot more in depth about your

320
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:08,449
passion for the actual event so you know

321
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,819
you want to start off probably with

322
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,558
maybe 400 to 800 milligrams and slowly

323
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:14,358
work your way up to 12 and then at that

324
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,980
point you go outside and put your hands

325

think I've done 350 I mean a 350

334
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:56,230
I found best to imbibe the 1200

335
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,120
milligrams of straight capsules and you

336
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,700
open the capsules up and take them while

337
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,959
they're half okay and then you just

338
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,509
pretty much you know you just jump right

339
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,919
in like Allen's carpet see the the the

340
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,619
last time we were preparing for the

341
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,450
milligrams at 1200 milligrams challenged

342
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:12,038
it I was actually pretty disappointed

343
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,750
because I was you know talking hell of

344
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,250
[ __ ] on everybody because I've been

345
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,798
training really hard like I was waking

346
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,839
up every day just slamming you know

347
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,579
eating a thousand milligrams for

348
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,928
breakfast you know what I'm saying then

349
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:24,759
having another couple hundred for lunch

350
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:27,070
you know what I'm saying I was ready by

351
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,169
the time that happened everybody else

352
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:31,000
had been eaten so many capsules to

353
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,890
training for training for the challenge

354
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,339
that it was just like [ __ ] wasn't going

355
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:40,990
well business in Washington who was

356
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:45,639
gonna be doing it with us he broke like

357
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:57,730
two mothership minis that he knocked

358
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:59,259
over his mother it's not like you want

359
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,360
to go straight to the black diamonds at

360
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:06,429
the mountain and throw your serious 1200

361
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,048
to make sure we were over a thousand and

362
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:11,590
if you really want to get intense you

363
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:13,750
tried it 2500 yeah that just sounds the

364
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:18,308
rim again soon that's like that's like

365
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,778
the gram dab of edibles if you don't

366
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:21,009
smoke those are obviously good ways to

367
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,288
do it if you're really trying to get you

368
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:24,579
know some sort of sedation for me it was

369
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:27,490
just the fact like I don't have anxiety

370
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:29,230

375
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
like we figured if we could do like 1200

376
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,620
milligrams for a month there was no way

377
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,440
that we would ever have any pathogens

378
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:50,009
cancers [ __ ] because we're just

390
00:32:39,588 --> 00:33:04,428
noticed if I smoke too much CBD I can't

391
00:32:42,108 --> 00:33:07,188
bust a nut to really perform that kind

392
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:17,149
of research on myself I went to a

393
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:18,619
dispensary I had a medicine and we

394
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:20,478
smoked out and we went to the house and

[Music]

399
00:33:34,118 --> 00:34:43,748
I was talking to a nurse and she said I

400
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,789
think she's a paramedic or something and

401
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,348
she said that there is an electrical

402
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:49,539
response in your brain that causes a

403
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,980
seizure and that same electrical

404
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,079
response in your brain is responsible

405
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,449
for your orgasm it's like the electrical

406
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,619
firing when you smoke CBD it turns that

407
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:01,419
off that's why you don't have a seizure

408
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:06,970
you're coding you're freaking [ __ ]

on the video game uncharted Drake is an

519
00:45:22,750 --> 00:46:33,809
adventurer because since moving to

520
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:36,639
[ __ ] Colorado I've seen more flow

521
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:38,440
smells or tastes exactly like [ __ ]

522
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,299
flow than I've seen ever in my [ __ ]

523
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,940
life what's up with that is that the

524
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:46,329
bomb I don't they don't like push they

525
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,010
don't like where's the cush it goes the

526
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:49,269
dogs trying to go outside okay it's cool

527
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,589
I think I mean I think a lot of it is

528
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:52,059
the fact that like that blue dream just

529
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:54,779
blows up like a balloon for people that

530
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,779
don't know what they're doing

531
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:07,719
the flow is super easy to grow and if

532
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,740
your mediocre grower and you need to

533
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:13,259
pull some weight dream dream is for you

534
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:19,289
if you never grown wheat you've never

535
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:21,030
grown weed before and you're about the

536
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:23,639
flow that goes around here actually came

537
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,349
from DJ short gave that cut to Ed

538
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,569
Rosenthal who passed it around to a few

539
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,250
people out here and my friend Tom I had

540
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,109
a dispensary here and a dispensary in

541
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,150
Pueblo and he spread that out through

542
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:34,289
his dispensaries a lot and also went

543
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,950
through other sources I'm not saying he

544
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:37,259
put it all over

545
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:39,358
but that cut I actually think his DJ's

546
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:47,520
flow to cut and not flow I think back in

547
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:48,900
the 1940s when they so I crossed the

548

I don't know about you guys but I've

856
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:22,369
been walking around singing no belt no

857
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:26,979
braska for like a week now it's uh yeah

858
01:21:22,369 --> 01:21:26,979
the only downfall is they used a lot of

859
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:31,430
inside jokes you know like and they

860
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,989
tried to explain him to the best of the

861
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:35,990
ability but it's it's more one of those

862
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:37,489
things you had to bend I was just

863
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:42,800
laughing every time they would say

864
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:45,469
something like ham wallet it got pushed

865
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,360
off like it wasn't anything I was

866
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:49,250
letting [ __ ] just slide by because the

867
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:51,079
more I was like ah [ __ ] the more it came

868
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:53,600
out it was fun to do but it was fun just

869
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:54,979
letting some [ __ ] slide too and you you

870

time so didn't I kind of believe him I

921

922
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,189
between sativa and indica you know I'm

923

929
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:37,149
the dishes are perfectly clean in the

930
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:39,299
kitchen but it was useless I should have

931
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:39,299
been

932
01:24:39,448 --> 01:25:37,419

938
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:49,300
with all the news articles that I found

939
01:25:46,988 --> 01:25:58,448

this will be out like March 29th I think

942
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:06,539

943
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:06,539
that the first episode was ever released

944
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:13,480
some commercials I'll give you guys the

945
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:17,109
option I've got some SF vog I've got

946
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:19,839
Gorilla Glue and I've got lemonade which

947
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:22,448
one should we dab here you already know

948
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,849
that I'm gonna pitch towards the sfv

949
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:40,210
because it is a it is a dank straying

950
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:42,969
from topics and we give my baby this is

951
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:45,849
the San Fernando Valley made popular I

952
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:47,800
don't even know it's really popular from

953
01:26:45,849 --> 01:26:50,369
the Cali connection is who put out the

954
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,369
seeds but

955
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:55,590
but they put out the seeds of the sfv

956
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,250
and it's a great breeding strain it

957
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:59,130
tastes good

958
01:26:56,250 --> 01:27:00,869
it's a super nice high turf X blasted

959
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:02,970
extracted this and everything turf x

960
01:27:00,869 --> 01:27:05,220
does is quality they change their labels

961
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:06,780
I like their new logo shout out also

962
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,060
check out their new website and they do

963
01:27:06,779 --> 01:27:11,369
a hell of a job dude I have been driving

964
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:18,900
around in my car and just randomly like

965
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:25,920

966
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:27,839
idea my wife she's definitely hurt it

967
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,640
like every every time I'm sitting in

968
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,640
there hitting the bowl it's it just it

969
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:34,800
comes out whether there's no melt or not

970
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:56,490

978

you're coming to the meeting let me know

1038
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:50,739
girl meeting April 26th at Highgrove

1039
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:52,179
indoor growing supplies I'll talk about

1040
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:55,359
that more in the future keep reminding

1041
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:56,610
you guys I felt like the last meeting

1042
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,869
like a lot of stuff was talked about

1043
01:31:56,609 --> 01:32:00,759
pretense but then when it came down to

1044
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:02,500
who's got any questions everybody was

1045
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,810
maybe a little embarrassed to speak up

1046
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,310
in front of the crowd and it wasn't it's

1047
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:07,510
because you're in a community of growers

1048
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:09,160
and I don't really think that should be

1049
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:11,920
the place to be embarrassed that's the

1050
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:13,059
place to get help but nobody wanted to

1051
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,289
show that they were yellow belts when

1052
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:17,140
there were fifth degree black belts in

1053
01:32:14,289 --> 01:32:21,819
the room absolutely it would have been

1054
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:22,539
rough to be the first that we write down

1055
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:25,618

real life is real bro it is mics here

1088
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:50,039
Mike has the privilege of taking my old

1089
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:52,409
soil out of the pot and putting it into

1090
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:54,869
the recycling bin for soil this is

1091
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:57,119
serious privilege [ __ ] you're teh

1092
01:33:54,869 --> 01:34:01,380
mover yeah I get to play with dirt all

1093
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:03,029
day did you see in the past 20 pots that

1094
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:05,699
we have harvested have you seen a

1095
01:34:03,029 --> 01:34:08,250
massive increase in my root mass yeah

1096
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:10,500
the amount of root material in these

1097
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:15,149
pauses insane lately people I've been

1098
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:18,600
I've been breaking up dirt pots but I

1099
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:20,839
think about it but everybody's been

1100
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:23,190
breaking over old pot and had like a

1101
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:25,470
handful of little tiny sad-ass root

1102
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:26,789
there and lately you've got to smash the

1103
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:28,789
root ball against the wall for a little

1104
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:30,890
bit just to get a some dirt back

1105
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:32,149
spins hands and they're not in there any

1106
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:33,560
longer you're gonna say we just let them

1107
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:35,210
grow more time now they're actually in

1108
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,340
there shorter because I ran this crop

1109
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:38,630
really quickly I wanted to get some kind

1110
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:40,369
of drop down they're not getting root

1111
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:42,380
bound there's just an insane amount of

1112
01:34:40,369 --> 01:34:44,029
incredibly healthy root material and see

1113
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,699
that's kind of what I was pointing at is

1114
01:34:44,029 --> 01:34:50,300
like if you're using that would it be

1115
01:34:46,699 --> 01:34:55,429
better to kind of transplant more you

1116
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:57,050
know more often or just because a larger

1117
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:58,850
pot would have been helpful but it

1118
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:00,890
wasn't necessary it wasn't to that point

1119
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:02,480
a larger pot from the get-go I wouldn't

1120
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,920
necessarily say transplanting more

1121
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,709
frequently would be a good thing there's

1122
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,020
a lot of stress yeah but you know we've

1123
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:10,880
gotten it down not to brag on ourselves

1124
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,110
you can transplant some [ __ ] where

1125
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,609
there's like zero stress where the

1126
01:35:12,109 --> 01:35:15,609
plants are even happier they're like oh

1127
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:22,429
you guys get comfortable I like to go

1128
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:24,139
myself I go from the cloner into a cup

1129
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,610
actually I've been introduced to a new

1130
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,200
product that I really like it's just

1131
01:35:25,609 --> 01:35:28,729
called a clone cup you can order them I

1132
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,630
check them out on Instagram I don't know

1133
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:31,729
where to order them they were kicked

1134
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:33,350
down to me as a gift for a trial a trial

1135
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:34,459
and I really like them they're harder

1136
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:36,620
than a normal cup they're a little

1137
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:40,010
bigger than a normal cup they're raised

1138
01:35:36,619 --> 01:36:02,960
a little and they've got holes so the

1139
01:35:40,010 --> 01:36:05,480
company I really like and then I let it

1140
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,130
kind kind of close to rootbound

1141
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:08,569
in that cup but not I just want to see

1142
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:10,010
the thick roots on the outside if I

1143
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:11,269
picked up the dirt I wanna see roots but

1144
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:13,010
I don't let the plants start to stretch

1145
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:15,050
in there and then I go to a three gallon

1146
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:17,239
and then sometimes if I'm doing like a

1147
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:18,770
breeding fino hunt I'll run them in

1148
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:20,630
three all flower them out in the three

1149
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,890
gallon well they're real sure if I'm

1150
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:24,289
going bigger I'll throw them into a

1151
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:26,180
seven gallon and flower mount in a seven

1152
01:36:24,289 --> 01:36:29,359
and I went the same amount of time I

1153
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:31,190
just added grow Kashi worm castings the

1154
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:32,329
Dragonfly earth medicine root dust the

1155
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:35,000
black one I can't think of the name of

1156
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:36,829
the battle's not over here

1157
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,069
just simple stuff like that and I did a

1158
01:36:36,829 --> 01:36:41,960
little bit of fish hydrous late and I've

1159
01:36:40,069 --> 01:36:43,969
started to cut out though GT I'm not

1160
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,550
using Oh GT now okay dude my roots were

1161
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:47,869
huge yeah SuperDuper huge I could have

1162
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:50,270
used a bigger pot but I don't think it

1163
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:51,439
was necessary I think I did the right

1164
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,990
amount it's and they weren't root bound

1165
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,639
but the roots were spaghetti like I just

1166
01:36:53,989 --> 01:37:03,439
know that since we've started using them

1167
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:05,750
having them in cups is almost like you

1168
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:07,669
know it's you're literally it you have

1169
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:11,510
to be on your stuff cause if you leave

1170
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:13,699
them there's cops way that's I mean

1171
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:17,600
regular plants do but with the worm

1172
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:19,279
casting it is a little bit I know I said

1173
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,600
I had a bunch of news but since we're

1174
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:23,029
talking about all this organic stuff

1175
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,579
another thing that I've noticed that has

1176
01:37:23,029 --> 01:37:28,609
really contributed to the improvement in

1177
01:37:25,579 --> 01:37:30,890
my plants I use it in my bedroom I use

1178
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:32,509
it in my flowering room everything but

1179
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:34,310
the clones gets it the clones get it now

1180
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:36,829
as soon as they go into the dirt I feed

1181
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:39,680
at this Shawn gave me something called a

1182
01:37:36,829 --> 01:37:41,960
bow Kashi bucket the [ __ ] bucket is

1183
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:45,320
basically a five gallon bucket with a

1184
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,270
piece of piece of plastic as a catch or

1185
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:49,519
a shelf in there then that shelf has

1186
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:51,980
holes in it and then underneath that

1187
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,170
shelf is a spigot and the idea is that

1188
01:37:51,979 --> 01:37:55,219
you throw we'll talk about more in a

1189
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:57,020
minute with more detail but you throw

1190
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:59,060
your chute in there and it starts to get

1191
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,560
funky and then you can turn the spigot

1192
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,850
and get the chute out is why that little

1193
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,789
shelf is in there you get juice out of

1194
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:08,360
it juice juice nasty it's like a

1195
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:10,760
miniature compost pile juice okay so the

1196
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:13,819
best way and set up like a Gatorade

1197
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:15,230
great way because I was going way way a

1198
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:20,960
different way so you take the Boshy

1199
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:22,159
bucket it's got a little shelf that you

1200
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,600
put down some of them have it pre

1201
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:25,099
affixed there's different models of the

1202
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,780
bucket that you get so there's a little

1203
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,760
shelf in there with holes in it I put

1204
01:38:26,779 --> 01:38:31,279
down a thin layer of newspaper just one

1205
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:33,619
sheet of newspaper so that I made more

1206
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,359
of a screen and then I put a small layer

1207
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:36,890
of the bow Koshy down it comes with some

1208
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:39,049
powdered stuff called Bokashi I

1209
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:40,789
sprinkled about a handful of that on the

1210
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:44,300
screen and then what you do is you just

1211
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:45,920
put I put I'm a vegetarian and every

1212
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:48,810
banana that I eat has a banana peel

1213
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,970
every strawberry that I eat has

1214
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:52,050
the leafy part at the end of it there

1215
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:53,340
are some strawberries that come in the

1216
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:55,440
package that are inedible

1217
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:57,270
every time you I eat an onion the way I

1218
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:59,279
clean my onion is I chop each end off of

1219
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:01,140
the onion and then I can get that onion

1220
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,729
skin right off of it and so I've got an

1221
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:05,400
end of each one or each end of it and

1222
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:08,099
the onion skin and then I clean it that

1223
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:09,719
ends and the skin go into my little Bowl

1224
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:12,720
and then once I've got this bowl filled

1225
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:15,630
I throw all my banana peels my eggshells

1226
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,449
my onion ends my carrots they got funky

1227
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:20,400
the celery that I found coffee grounds

1228
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:21,929
are you have to dry them set them out

1229
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,239
and let them dry first if you're gonna

1230
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:26,430
do that but I do my yerba matee that

1231
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,479
I've cooked or that I've used and my

1232
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,920
coffee grounds gonna send them on a

1233
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:29,969
paper towel and let them dry for like 48

1234
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,909
hours you don't want to put too much

1235
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:36,510
moisture in there I could explain why

1236
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:39,389
but it's too much - what else you can

1237
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:40,739
put meat and dairy in there you can put

1238
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,780
your meat and dairy products and bread

1239
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:44,670
in there I choose not to put I don't eat

1240
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:46,979
any meat or dairy and I only put a

1241
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:48,690
little bit of be weird if your steaks go

1242
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:53,099
or if your plants got pork chops and

1243
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:54,839
steak and you didn't write that comes

1244
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,890
here and I just put the vegetables and

1245
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,989
the fruits and [ __ ] in there and

1246
01:39:55,890 --> 01:40:00,840
although like some grapes and so there's

1247
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:03,630
apple cores and potato peels so you put

1248
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:04,980
they say to put a two inch layer of food

1249
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,690
waste in there and then sprinkle a

1250
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:08,399
handful of the Bokashi and then another

1251
01:40:06,689 --> 01:40:10,589
two-inch layer and sprinkle a handful of

1252
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,659
Bokashi I try not to open it very often

1253
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:14,520
I throw all of my scraps into a bowl and

1254
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:15,930
once the ball has starts to sneak up the

1255
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,840
kitchen then I put that in the Bocage

1256
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:21,210
bucket right Mike you've been here when

1257
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:22,920
I open the bucket I don't recommend

1258
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:31,199
going full work and keeping it in your

1259
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:33,180
kitchen like some people it is right you

1260
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:37,800
can smell the magic we're fermenting

1261
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:47,490
banana peels apple cores grapes there

1262
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:48,600
are eggshells in there so you keep

1263
01:40:47,489 --> 01:40:50,550
putting your keep packing your fruit

1264
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,170
vegetables in there or your food waste

1265
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:54,270
you can put your bacon and eggs in there

1266
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,779
if you want to all your food waste can

1267
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:56,070
go in there

1268
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:57,479
then you pack it down with this little

1269
01:40:56,069 --> 01:40:58,979
packer and keep sprinkling in the coffee

1270
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:00,899
and then you seal it right and then

1271
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:03,359
after about it took me about 10 days

1272
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:04,799
about ten days you unscrew the spigot

1273
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,738
that's on there and I put a mason jar

1274
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:10,289
underneath it and this juice comes out

1275
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:14,099
and it starts off clear and kind of pink

1276
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:16,140
or orange ish and it smells like oh it

1277
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:18,300
is like the bar trash can they got

1278
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:19,710
thrown up in and left in the Sun I feel

1279
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:21,029
like it should be a game in the podcast

1280
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:34,408
you should just have the jar sitting

1281
01:41:21,029 --> 01:41:38,039
here and people what is this I throw

1282
01:41:34,408 --> 01:41:40,019
that into a clean water with a bubbler

1283
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:43,529
and it bubbles up real good and it makes

1284
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:45,270
the stinkiest feed that to my plant and

1285
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:50,340
I can see them dance around we have a

1286
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:52,080
ladder or bucket yeah quick hole and

1287
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:53,869
just slide the tube through just that's

1288
01:41:52,079 --> 01:42:08,039
the end of that story

1289
01:41:53,869 --> 01:42:09,750
it's more details I'll fill it up it's

1290
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,969
almost to the top now I feel like I've

1291
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:13,859
got one more good dump of my bowl of

1292
01:42:11,969 --> 01:42:15,719
banana peels ate a lot of bananas you

1293
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:16,889
guys have a banana addiction I think

1294
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:17,850
they're really good for me and they give

1295
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:23,310
me a lot of energy and they're healthy

1296
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:25,199
and they're organic bananas bananas but

1297
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:26,550
I've got one more dump into there and

1298
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,799
then once I dump that bowl into there

1299
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:30,179
I'm out of coffee so I won't even be

1300
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,400
able to put my coffee in there I'll seal

1301
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:33,420
it and let it seal for about 14 days and

1302
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,549
everything that's in there is

1303
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:37,500
essentially pickling that's like

1304
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:39,029
fermenting and pickling in there and

1305
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,770
I'll pull out juice out of there I'll

1306
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:43,469
get a lot of that I call it coffee juice

1307
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:45,989
I'll probably get five six maybe eight

1308
01:42:43,469 --> 01:42:47,698
to ten depending on how I don't know how

1309
01:42:45,988 --> 01:42:50,279
soggy the top layer is gonna get I'll

1310
01:42:47,698 --> 01:42:52,649
get eight to ten jars hopefully of that

1311
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:56,389
Kashi juice out of there and then I will

1312
01:42:52,649 --> 01:42:59,789
take two large kiddie pools of soil and

1313
01:42:56,390 --> 01:43:01,350
I will put half of that Kashi bucket on

1314
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:02,819
the bottom of one kiddie pool and half

1315
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:05,250
of the Kashi bucket on another kiddie

1316
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:07,738
pool and cover that up with store bag

1317
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:10,698
soil and mix that [ __ ] in and then in

1318
01:43:07,738 --> 01:43:12,919
like 14 to 21 days we'll have some day

1319
01:43:10,698 --> 01:43:15,109
composted soil I just watch Mike eyes

1320
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:33,399
like immediately go pointed in words

1321
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:35,719
like wait a minute one worm castings -

1322
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:37,429
they're just yet but in the future there

1323
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:40,310
will be castings added to that same soil

1324
01:43:37,429 --> 01:43:42,829
yes indeed yes and that soil will get

1325
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:45,560
that'll just be the base like we need a

1326
01:43:42,829 --> 01:43:47,179
little bit of that soil per the regular

1327
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,370
soil mixing bin we'll just cut it down

1328
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:50,779
yeah and it'll make some dank soil

1329
01:43:49,369 --> 01:44:07,130
there'd be a lot of microbes in there

1330
01:43:50,779 --> 01:44:09,319
yeah between the grow koshy what else

1331
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:11,449
are we use in fish hydro slates and the

1332
01:44:09,319 --> 01:44:13,069
dragonfly earth medicine you should see

1333
01:44:11,448 --> 01:44:14,719
the roots on my plants and the veg

1334
01:44:13,069 --> 01:44:15,799
growth happening in my plants there are

1335
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,810
other things that we still have to

1336
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,400
supplement and stuff but my roots are

1337
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:21,590
amazing I'm super impressed and I'm

1338
01:44:19,399 --> 01:44:25,279
making my own [ __ ] I can make with a

1339
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:29,300
handful of worm castings with one jar of

1340
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:31,009
that Kashi tea with 15 scoops of grow

1341
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:32,390
Kashi which sounds like a lot it's 10

1342
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:36,440
scoops of grow Kashi there's never

1343
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:37,880
enough really can't hurt yourself I mean

1344
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:40,309
you can but and if you want to use

1345
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,539
molasses it's like just like five ounces

1346
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:44,510
if you don't want to use molasses you

1347
01:44:41,539 --> 01:44:46,310
don't need it but you could make I mean

1348
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:48,469
25 gallons of nutrients with just that

1349
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:51,590
right there and it was amazing it was

1350
01:44:48,469 --> 01:44:53,270
totally amazing green plants all my

1351
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:55,279
veggies all my clothes that got put into

1352
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:57,170
new pots they all got fed that and they

1353
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:59,149
look completely happy they love life

1354
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:04,579
everything is pretty much been switched

1355
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:06,289
over to organic so it's to recycle all

1356
01:45:04,579 --> 01:45:07,909
of your garden stuff that's a good way

1357
01:45:06,289 --> 01:45:09,140
or all your garden stuff all your waste

1358
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:10,519
all your food waste what the heck

1359
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:11,989
happened my papers they all landed the

1360
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:19,190
wrong order they're backwards it's weird

1361
01:45:11,988 --> 01:45:20,659
I'm confused just take your food scraps

1362
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:22,129
and throw it in there and you can make

1363
01:45:20,659 --> 01:45:22,760
your own nutrients guys we can save the

1364
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:25,699
world

1365
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:28,239
one drink at a time one food at time one

1366
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:28,238
yeah

1367

this on the pod but please don't mention

1414
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:53,659
my real name just use vape dad on reddit

1415
01:48:50,088 --> 01:48:55,578
very active in our slash trees then he

1416
01:48:53,658 --> 01:48:57,588
talked about his soil where he is and

1417
01:48:55,578 --> 01:48:59,088
then he says I was reading a book called

1418
01:48:57,588 --> 01:49:00,319
cannabis cultivation the other day at

1419
01:48:59,088 --> 01:49:02,779
Barnes &amp; Noble and they recommended

1420
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:04,308
putting ladybugs in our greenhouse to

1421
01:49:02,779 --> 01:49:06,288
fight Athens and caterpillars and a

1422
01:49:04,309 --> 01:49:08,179
whole assortment of pests so in

1423
01:49:06,288 --> 01:49:09,889
researching organic growing for no other

1424
01:49:08,179 --> 01:49:12,889
reason than I like the all-natural

1425
01:49:09,889 --> 01:49:14,149
aspect of it thinking thinking like this

1426
01:49:12,889 --> 01:49:16,878
I was wondering would it be a good idea

1427
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:17,329
to raise loose ladybugs in your grow

1428
01:49:16,878 --> 01:49:18,828
room

1429
01:49:17,328 --> 01:49:20,889
what could they hurt in the stages of

1430
01:49:18,828 --> 01:49:23,328
growth if anything or could these be

1431
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:25,368
nature's pest control for those aspiring

1432
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:27,259
to care games this may be a dumb

1433
01:49:25,368 --> 01:49:29,029
question but I just wanted to ask a live

1456
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:40,800
show with Ari and Joey Diaz so let's get

1457
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:42,990
to the point here and dude you said this

1458
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,810
may be a dumb question no dumb questions

1459
01:50:42,989 --> 01:50:47,099
bro never no dumb questions at all

1460
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:48,990
somewhere I had training wheels at one

1461
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,160
point and now I'm doing wheelies and you

1462
01:50:48,989 --> 01:50:53,579
just gotta start somewhere there are no

1463
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:55,319
dumb questions my theory on ladybugs and

1464
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:57,479
Michael probably back me up on this a

1465
01:50:55,319 --> 01:50:58,889
long time ago I did what I thought was

1466
01:50:57,479 --> 01:51:04,199
cute and I went to the hydro store and I

1467
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:06,240
bought a thousand ladybugs yeah and let

1468
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:08,309
them fly about the grow room they were

1469
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:10,710
cute I got the camera took pictures of

1470
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:22,110
ladybugs [ __ ] on my plants and it was

1471
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:32,430
really cool yep did they sell 300 the

1472
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:34,649
t-shirt from Amazon a flying all your

1473
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:36,570
fans they fly up into your lights so

1474
01:51:34,649 --> 01:51:38,939
here's something that Sean taught me uh

1475
01:51:36,569 --> 01:51:40,710
credit to Sean king Cola he taught me

1476
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:43,129
this and I'm gonna butcher it because I

1477
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:46,649
had a head injury

1478
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:49,230
ladybugs don't see in the same spectrum

1479
01:51:46,649 --> 01:51:51,029
as humans ladybugs see a UV spectrum

1480
01:51:49,229 --> 01:51:53,159
that it's only provided by the light so

1481
01:51:51,029 --> 01:51:55,439
when we take a ladybug and we put it in

1482
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:57,479
a grow room all it sees is a grow light

1483
01:51:55,439 --> 01:51:59,159
and it all it doesn't see it it's

1484
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:00,779
confused now and it wants to get toward

1485
01:51:59,159 --> 01:52:02,670
the white that it can't see and that's

1486
01:52:00,779 --> 01:52:04,289
why I'm the warmth and so it flies into

1487
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:05,940
your hoods it flies into your fans and

1488
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:19,519
you get to sweep them all up and they

1489
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:22,199
smell terrible yeah they didn't do much

1490
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,070
there are predatory mites that are worth

1491
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:25,109
it

1492
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:27,539
their work indoors but I don't think

1493
01:52:25,109 --> 01:52:29,639
that ladybugs praying mantis or cool

1494
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:32,039
indoors they don't run away and ladybugs

1495
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:33,510
are also micro Tori creatures they want

1496
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:34,920
to take off they don't want to be there

1497
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:36,300
they want to go in and they want to fly

1498
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,480
away and they want to eat and they want

1499
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:42,270
to fly away yeah so in my honest opinion

1500
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:43,679
I would say no on the ladybugs in an

1501
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,720
indoor situation if you have a

1502
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:47,250
greenhouse or an outdoor situation and

1503
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,390
you're ready to keep you're gonna have

1504
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:50,550
to keep adding to them and you're also

1505
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:52,920
gonna have to feed them they do require

1506
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:54,480
food even if there are a feeds and [ __ ]

1507
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,670
they're like you don't want to eat

1508
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:57,989
hummus and falafel all day you need to

1509
01:52:56,670 --> 01:53:00,119
change so you're gonna provide them some

1510
01:52:57,989 --> 01:53:01,349
kind of food so keep that in mind if

1511
01:53:00,119 --> 01:53:03,420
you're gonna use them in an outdoor or

1512
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:05,490
greenhouse situation but indoors I would

1513
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:08,069
not do the ladybugs and then that food

1514
01:53:05,489 --> 01:53:10,500
could also bring other pests that's very

1515
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:12,059
likely very likely at this point I tell

1516
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:15,720
people to release them around their

1517
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:16,800
their Gro not in their grow room at this

1518
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,289
point so leave sprinkle them in the

1519
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,909
front and backyard don't bother with

1520
01:53:19,289 --> 01:53:22,590
them otherwise just as like an extra

1521
01:53:20,909 --> 01:53:24,329
preventative measure and the thing about

1522
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:26,400
the Mantis is I've been in a few pet

1523
01:53:24,329 --> 01:53:28,140
stores here in Colorado like you guys

1524
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:31,170
carry mantas and I'm expecting to like

1525
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:33,980
see a whole you know fish tank full of

1526
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:45,470
mantises and like y'all take 30 of them

1527
01:53:33,979 --> 01:53:47,779
it's it's yeah yeah there's a website go

1528
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:49,220
there are be co-organized they've got

1529
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:51,619
all kinds of great [ __ ] they'll send you

1530
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:53,180
bugs they'll send you nematodes some of

1531
01:53:51,619 --> 01:53:55,189
it is seasonal so you might not be able

1532
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:56,810
to get everything but organic pest

1533
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:58,909
control at its finest they don't pay me

1534
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:01,370
to say that I just like sharing useful

1535
01:53:58,909 --> 01:54:03,470
[ __ ] with people we've been doing 32

1536
01:54:01,369 --> 01:54:05,239
minutes I'd like to go about 45 maybe an

1537
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:07,190
hour at the most and I also want to read

1538
01:54:05,239 --> 01:54:14,300
some news articles so you guys want to

1539
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:17,659
get into the news I do think so I kind

1540
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:19,670
of agree with you I'm gonna take a drink

1541
01:54:17,659 --> 01:54:22,699
here we're gonna dab some lemonade from

1542
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:25,850
her pecs I think was it John John that

1543
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:28,159
recommended this to us somebody talk for

1544
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:30,740
a second when I was down there he didn't

1545
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:32,720
he had not had a sample of the review

1546
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:34,969
yet so he couldn't really give me an

1547
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:37,520
honest opinion but the name was enticing

1548
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:41,590
but names can be misleading sometimes

1549
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:44,330
yes we all know about the name game so

1550
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:48,110
it was interesting hearing about where

1551
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:50,029
the handkerchief came from and I'm a

1552

01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,698
this one caught my attention actually

1614
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:45,850
want to give a big shout out to one of

1615
01:58:42,698 --> 01:58:47,439
my Facebook friends Mike Holly we used

1616
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:49,810
to call him by Cal it could be Michael

1617
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:51,939
Holly but he's from Boston he's a

1618
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:53,140
Masshole he's a cool-ass dude to tell

1619
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:56,198
you the truth he knows what's up with

1620
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:58,719
cannabis he's educated he's smart he can

1621
01:58:56,198 --> 01:59:00,669
separate the [ __ ] from the truth

1622
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,960
you should be more known in our cannabis

1623
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:03,399
community and I want to give him a

1624
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,260
shout-out right now he probably doesn't

1625
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:07,509
listen to this show in any way but you'd

1626
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:08,980
shut out to Mike by Kaui you do a good

1627
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:11,530
job where I appreciate all your Facebook

1628
01:59:08,979 --> 01:59:13,448
posts I see how much you try to help and

1629
01:59:11,529 --> 01:59:16,448
participate with our community and I

1630
01:59:13,448 --> 01:59:17,678
[ __ ] appreciate it that's what I

1631
01:59:16,448 --> 01:59:19,719
found out about this story but it says

1632
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:21,699
pot pesticide contamination in Denver

1633
01:59:19,719 --> 01:59:24,340
grows the article is by William breeds

1634
01:59:21,698 --> 01:59:25,719
and it says I'm gonna choke her in a

1635
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:27,969
second cuz I took a huge dab but just

1636
01:59:25,719 --> 01:59:29,500
bear with me 6 marijuana grows in Denver

1637
01:59:27,969 --> 01:59:31,600
were ordered to quarantine and possibly

1638
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:33,130
destroy plant harvest after Denver Fire

1639
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:34,719
Department officials determined that the

1640
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:35,630
girl facilities weren't using chemicals

1641
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:41,168
properly

1642
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:41,168
[Music]

1643
01:59:43,539 --> 01:59:48,069
mike has moved away from the microphone

1644
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:59,090
alright they're not using chemicals

1645
01:59:57,529 --> 02:00:00,439
properly bugs and pass for a fact of

1646
01:59:59,090 --> 02:00:02,210
life for commercial growers but dealing

1647
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:04,159
with them appropriately is important

1648
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:06,198
because eventually humans will consume

1649
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:07,488
in the pot earlier this month the city

1650
02:00:06,198 --> 02:00:09,079
of Denver released a bulletin warning

1651
02:00:07,488 --> 02:00:11,299
crows our warning grows about the

1652
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:12,769
improper use of pesticides because the

1653
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:14,239
fire department's recent discovery the

1654
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:16,130
city has ordered all licensed pot

1655
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:19,369
growers in the city to send in pesticide

1656
02:00:16,130 --> 02:00:21,050
reports by April first pesticides and

1657
02:00:19,369 --> 02:00:22,670
agricultural chemicals must be used in

1658
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:24,440
accordance with the product label and

1659
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:27,500
with all applicable federal state and

1660
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:29,179
local laws and regulations improper use

1661
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,710
of pesticides on marijuana can raise

1662
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:33,199
serious public health concerns the

1663
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:34,640
bulletin reads the catch is that the

1664
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:36,409
federal agency in charge of regulating

1665
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:37,670
pesticide use the Environmental

1666
02:00:36,409 --> 02:00:39,319
Protection Agency doesn't have

1667
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:41,300
acceptable levels for use on cannabis

1668
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:43,460
since cannabis is illegal on a federal

1669
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:45,409
level the Colorado Department of

1670
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:47,149
Agriculture lacks official guidelines to

1671
02:00:45,409 --> 02:00:48,439
beyond suggesting that growers not use

1672
02:00:47,149 --> 02:00:50,899
any pesticides that haven't been

1673
02:00:48,439 --> 02:00:53,589
specifically tested labeled and assigned

1674
02:00:50,899 --> 02:00:55,460
to set tolerance for pot growing now

1675
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:57,110
anybody that's listen to this podcast

1676
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:58,939
for more than three or four episodes

1677
02:00:57,109 --> 02:01:00,649
already knows what my solution to part

1678
02:00:58,939 --> 02:01:01,789
of this problem is the environmental

1679
02:01:00,649 --> 02:01:03,289
protection agency does not have

1680
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:05,060
acceptable levels for use of cannabis

1681
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:07,880
since cannabis is illegal on a federal

1682
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:12,350
level let's think about this solution

1683
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:14,270
anybody legalize cannabis yes see that's

1684
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:16,160
your first step that will make this a

1685
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:20,440
little bit easier if with legalization

1686
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:22,460
comes product safety people all right

1687
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:23,629
does have an unofficial list of

1688
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:25,489
pesticides that can be used on

1689
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:27,920
unspecified crops that are intended for

1690
02:01:25,488 --> 02:01:29,299
human consumption however Oh consumption

1691
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,440
however I kind of read that weird my

1692
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:32,029
fault and the state marijuana

1693
02:01:30,439 --> 02:01:33,649
Enforcement Division has a strict list

1694
02:01:32,029 --> 02:01:35,779
of allowed pesticides as well as

1695
02:01:33,649 --> 02:01:37,969
instructions for how grow owners have to

1696
02:01:35,779 --> 02:01:39,738
store and dispose of them state law also

1697
02:01:37,969 --> 02:01:41,448
requires that shops write up standard

1698
02:01:39,738 --> 02:01:43,789
operating operating procedures for all

1699
02:01:41,448 --> 02:01:45,769
pesticide applications in Denver

1700
02:01:43,789 --> 02:01:47,810
dispensaries will now be required to

1701
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:49,270
submit a list of every pesticide used

1702
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:51,640
and how much of it

1703
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:53,260
is used copies of those records must be

1704
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,980
kept in the facility where the marijuana

1705
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:55,720
has grown

1706
02:01:53,979 --> 02:01:57,339
additionally grows must send lists of

1707
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:59,590
pesticides and information on their

1708
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:02,289
safety to the Denver Fire Department and

1709
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:04,090
a sign must be placed on the door of

1710
02:02:02,289 --> 02:02:06,550
every grill room listing any and all

1711
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:08,949
pesticides used those businesses that

1712
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:11,560
don't comply could face fines could face

1713
02:02:08,949 --> 02:02:14,139
fines and closures and let me tell you I

1714
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:16,539
work with the dispensary and I'm there

1715
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:19,150
on a daily base my daily basis the past

1716
02:02:16,539 --> 02:02:20,529
couple of weeks dude they are not joking

1717
02:02:19,149 --> 02:02:22,539

02:02:20,529 --> 02:02:24,759
close you they will come in that day

1719
02:02:22,539 --> 02:02:25,899
they will find a violation that day they

1720
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:27,820
will write a ten thousand dollar fine

1721
02:02:25,899 --> 02:02:29,799
and they will close your shop down right

1722
02:02:27,819 --> 02:02:32,039

1724
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:37,539
I represent but I've seen it happen to

1725
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:39,520
another place people don't get the

1726
02:02:37,539 --> 02:02:45,640
amount of regulation and oversight that

1727
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:47,470
this industry bmed is massive here

1728
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:48,760
people it's been a long time since

1729
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:50,500
anyone said it but you'll hear people

1730
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:52,030
people who don't have an ID that want to

1731
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,909
get in can you just let me in just once

1732
02:02:52,029 --> 02:02:58,269
it's like dude this is a billion-dollar

1733
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:59,739
operation it's [ __ ] more money than

1734
02:02:58,270 --> 02:03:01,720
you could even imagine we're gonna risk

1735
02:02:59,739 --> 02:03:08,289
all of our business for one dude to

1736
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:10,180
sneak through without his ID I saw the

1737
02:03:08,289 --> 02:03:13,920
price list for just some of the Grove

1738
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:13,920
equipment that I ordered the other day

1739
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:20,378
[Music]

1740
02:03:25,529 --> 02:03:30,639
it says that the Denver Department of

1741
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:32,530
Public Health and Environment will be

1742
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:35,829
inspecting cultivation sites as well as

1743
02:03:32,529 --> 02:03:37,479
infused product manufacturing sites so

1744
02:03:35,829 --> 02:03:39,670
what was happening guys you heard the

1745
02:03:37,479 --> 02:03:41,109
article there were some shops in Denver

1746
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:43,119
some grows in Denver that were using

1747
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:45,969
chemicals that should not have been

1748
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:48,340
being used on the cannabis that they

1749
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:50,230
were selling to the public and it's my

1750
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:54,010
bad that the shops that were busting out

1751
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:56,279
those $75 and $99 ounces probably those

1752
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,280
guys

1753
02:04:03,488 --> 02:04:09,319
there's a picture of this article makes

1754
02:04:06,559 --> 02:04:11,149
it the best there is a picture of a guy

1755
02:04:09,319 --> 02:04:15,139
and like a Breaking Bad suit with the

1756
02:04:11,149 --> 02:04:17,239
full-on gas mask pouring a bottle of

1757
02:04:15,139 --> 02:04:31,029
monsanto chemicals into another

1758
02:04:17,238 --> 02:04:31,029
container and it's completely breaking

1759
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:37,038
this article it looks like glue it looks

1760
02:04:35,418 --> 02:04:38,088
like he's pouring glue well Eagle 20

1761
02:04:37,038 --> 02:04:40,998
looks like that if you've ever seen

1762
02:04:38,088 --> 02:04:42,588
Eagle 20 we talked about it friends and

1763
02:04:40,998 --> 02:04:44,059
I equal 20 was probably one of the

1764
02:04:42,588 --> 02:04:46,279
products being used in all of this

1765
02:04:44,059 --> 02:04:50,179
[ __ ] if I read it right the shops

1766
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:52,429
that have that crops quarantined right

1767
02:04:50,179 --> 02:04:54,078
now turn themselves in essentially like

1768
02:04:52,429 --> 02:04:56,389
they handed in their form that was doing

1769
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,498
it for one oh wow Edwyn that they

1770
02:04:56,389 --> 02:05:00,399
started looking out of they were like

1771
02:04:57,498 --> 02:05:02,538
hey wait that's on the whatever list

1772
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:04,489
this is the only article I've seen about

1773
02:05:02,538 --> 02:05:06,588
it there was another big change with

1774
02:05:04,488 --> 02:05:09,188

regional islands passage of this

1870
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:22,020

Jamaica's and Jamaica sovereign decision

1884
02:10:57,119 --> 02:11:01,380
marijuana into the US remains against

1885
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:03,329
the law we expect the Jamaica and all

1886
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:04,800
states party to the UN drug conventions

1887

1888
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,279
a firm commitment to combatting and

1889
02:11:06,539 --> 02:11:10,380
dismantling criminal organizations

1890
02:11:08,279 --> 02:11:12,609
involved in drug drug trafficking he

02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:14,800
told AP in an email

1892
02:11:12,609 --> 02:11:25,149
once again you guys how do we stop

1893
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:28,630
illegal cannabis trafficking by a small

1894
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:55,929
plane at first we fly people straight

1895
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:57,430
from Colorado to Jamaica for trip over

1896
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:59,140
relaxing laws prohibiting ganja but

1897
02:11:57,430 --> 02:12:00,550
previous calls did you criminalize small

1898
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:02,110
amounts of marijuana fizzled out because

1899
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:03,900
officials feared it would bring

1900
02:12:02,109 --> 02:12:06,069
sanctions from Washington

1901
02:12:03,899 --> 02:12:07,750
Jamaican officials now have high hopes

1902
02:12:06,069 --> 02:12:10,029
that the island can become a player in

1903
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:12,130
the nasty medical marijuana industry

1904
02:12:10,029 --> 02:12:14,649
health tourism and the development of

1905

innovative pot derived items local

1906
02:12:14,649 --> 02:12:18,099
scientists already have a history of

1907
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:20,199
treating marijuana derived products such

1908
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:24,579
as kennesaw which helps relieve pressure

1909
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:33,460
in the highs of glucomannan scientists

1910
02:12:24,579 --> 02:12:36,010
in Jamaica I've seen quite a few people

1911
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:45,939
that are moving down that way as well a

1912
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:47,140
lot of popular people coming up they

1918
02:13:04,359 --> 02:13:07,269
potential for Jamaica where marijuana

1919
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,550
has long been grown illegally on

1920
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:10,990
mountainsides and marshes the move by

1921
02:13:09,550 --> 02:13:12,130
Jamaican lawmakers adds to an

1922
02:13:10,989 --> 02:13:13,840
international trend of easing

1923
02:13:12,130 --> 02:13:16,569

decriminalized under a 2009 Supreme

1936

Court ruling that jail time for small

1937
02:13:40,289 --> 02:13:45,930

2199
02:29:52,729 --> 02:29:57,659

02:29:55,140 --> 02:30:00,270
marijuana legalization major energy use

2201
02:29:57,659 --> 02:30:04,890

electricity being ran better give some

2206
02:30:10,890 --> 02:30:16,440
credit here who Chris Mooney from The

2207
02:30:13,979 --> 02:30:18,060
Washington Post wrote this he says

2208
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:18,989
across the country there's a growing

2209
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:21,539
trend toward the legalization of

2210
02:30:18,989 --> 02:30:24,271
marijuana four states Oregon Washington

2211
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:25,771
Colorado Alaska have voted to allow

2212
02:30:24,271 --> 02:30:27,780
people to possess limited amounts of

2213
02:30:25,771 --> 02:30:29,521
marijuana for personal use and also to

2214
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:30,601
let producers apply for licenses to

2215
02:30:29,521 --> 02:30:33,780
produce and sell it

2216
02:30:30,601 --> 02:30:35,880
DC also just voted to allow voted to

2217
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:37,681
allow personal possession all of this on

2218
02:30:35,879 --> 02:30:40,680
top of the 23 states that allow it for

2219
02:30:37,681 --> 02:30:41,940
medical reasons in some states we just

2220
02:30:40,681 --> 02:30:43,351
read two different articles that gave me

2221
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:46,860
different numbers on that didn't we one

2222
02:30:43,351 --> 02:30:48,120
said 21 said 23 maybe they were taken at

2223
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:51,870
different times maybe they're dabbing

2224
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:53,820
also dabs the the way this gets counted

2225
02:30:51,870 --> 02:30:55,771
up is confusing because there's Senza

2226
02:30:53,819 --> 02:30:58,220
that second Sanjay Gupta special there's

2227
02:30:55,771 --> 02:31:01,230
been a whole bunch of CBD only states

2228
02:30:58,220 --> 02:31:08,399
across the South the pseudo medical how

2229
02:31:01,229 --> 02:31:09,841
you count that if you count that was

2230
02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:12,931
making the big fuss in New Jersey was

2231
02:31:09,841 --> 02:31:21,000
just in the news today one go back at it

2232
02:31:12,931 --> 02:31:23,159
like that should be the governor of

2233
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:28,780
Florida too so I mean like I've Thor's

2234
02:31:23,159 --> 02:31:30,789
brother order in the court

2235
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:32,079
are also now illegally cultivating and

2236
02:31:30,790 --> 02:32:14,380
producing marijuana a mainstream

2237
02:31:32,079 --> 02:32:18,060
industry is emerging yeah it's a little

2238
02:32:14,379 --> 02:32:18,060
heavy on the indica side so for daytime

2239
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:24,851
million dollars in Colorado last year

2240
02:32:23,351 --> 02:32:26,351
for instance but there's a surprising

2241
02:32:24,851 --> 02:32:28,450
catch it turns out that indoor marijuana

2242
02:32:26,351 --> 02:32:30,310
growth in particular a cultivation

2243
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:33,040
method often favored in the industry for

2244
02:32:30,310 --> 02:32:34,511
many reasons usings uses a surprising

2245
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:36,790
amount of energy

2246
02:32:34,511 --> 02:32:38,829
indeed the level of power use appears to

2247
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:40,450
be so significant that one scholar is

2248
02:32:38,829 --> 02:32:43,060
now suggesting that as the industry

2249
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:44,681
grows states and localities should take

2250
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:46,181
advantage of marijuana licensing

2251
02:32:44,681 --> 02:32:48,370
procedures to also regulate the

2252
02:32:46,181 --> 02:32:52,840
industry's use energy use and greenhouse

2253
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:57,130
gas emissions damn hippie this new

2254
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:59,079
industry this is a new industry that is

2255
02:32:57,129 --> 02:33:00,879
going to be pretty highly regulated I

2256
02:32:59,079 --> 02:33:02,409
felt like the state and local policy

2257
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:04,689
makers have a unique opportunity to

2258
02:33:02,409 --> 02:33:06,310
incorporate energy usage and climate

2259
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:08,409
assessments into their state marijuana

2260
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:10,119
licensing fees says Geena Warren a

2261
02:33:08,409 --> 02:33:12,369
professor at the Texas A&amp;M University

2262
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:14,410
School of Law whose paper titled

2263
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:16,391
regulating pot to save the polar bear

2264
02:33:14,409 --> 02:33:18,280
energy and climate impacts of the

2265
02:33:16,390 --> 02:33:20,140
marijuana industry will soon appear in

2266
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:22,320
the Columbia Journal of environmental

2267
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:22,319
laws

2268
02:33:26,709 --> 02:33:52,890
[Music]

2269
02:33:36,331 --> 02:33:52,890
like an obstacle of a there's a comma

2270
02:33:55,530 --> 02:33:59,771
[Music]

2271
02:33:57,149 --> 02:34:04,899
and then another comma and then a period

2272
02:33:59,771 --> 02:34:06,521
yeah that's good props the published

2273
02:34:04,899 --> 02:34:08,261
statistics on energy use from indoor

2274
02:34:06,521 --> 02:34:11,740
marijuana production will blow your mind

2275
02:34:08,261 --> 02:34:13,541
whether or not you use the stuff of

2276
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:15,070
carbon footprint of indoor cannabis

2277
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:17,500
production published in the journal

2278
02:34:15,070 --> 02:34:19,030
energy policy researcher Evan Mills

2279
02:34:17,501 --> 02:34:21,011
noted that on occasion previous

2280
02:34:19,031 --> 02:34:22,451
unrecognized spheres of energy used to

2281
02:34:21,011 --> 02:34:24,640
come to light and marijuana is a

2282
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:26,550
textbook example the study estimated

2283
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:30,161
that for cannabis both legal and illegal

2284
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:32,229
uses six billion dollars worth of

2285
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:34,511
electricity every year amounting to one

2286
02:34:32,229 --> 02:34:36,399
percent of overall u.s. electricity and

2287
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:38,320
in some production intensive states like

2288
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:41,440
California it was much higher three

2289
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:42,880
percent Mills found further but I'm

2290
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:50,501
going to assume that Colorado is going

2291
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:59,109
to hit like that would be there is less

2292
02:34:50,501 --> 02:35:00,820
people here so one average kilogram of a

2293
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:02,560
final product is associated with four

2294
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:04,479
thousand six hundred kilograms of carbon

2295
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:06,911
dioxide emissions to the atmosphere or

2296
02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:09,100
that of three million average u.s. cars

2297
02:35:06,911 --> 02:35:11,470
when aggregated across all national

2298
02:35:09,101 --> 02:35:13,150
production roll mills the reason is

2299
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:15,761
simply the technique the technology

2300
02:35:13,149 --> 02:35:17,501
required specific energy uses include

2301
02:35:15,761 --> 02:35:19,720
high intensity lighting dehumidification

2302
02:35:17,501 --> 02:35:21,729
remove to remove water vapor and avoid

2303
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:23,530
mold formation space heating or cooling

2304
02:35:21,729 --> 02:35:26,109
during non illuminated periods and

2305
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:28,301
drying preheating of irrigation water

2306
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:29,951
generation of carbon dioxide by burning

2307
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:32,670
fossil fuel and ventilation and air

2308
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:35,089
conditioning to remove waste heat right

2309
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:37,649
that's a well-researched they did our

2310
02:35:35,090 --> 02:35:40,229
math and they haven't figured out how

2311
02:35:37,649 --> 02:35:42,590
much carbon dioxide the plant sent back

2312
02:35:40,229 --> 02:35:44,729
out there

2313
02:35:42,590 --> 02:35:47,340
well no but there's another side of that

2314
02:35:44,729 --> 02:35:48,810
coin depends on the plant I agree with

2315
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:50,880
this article Foley I'm just saying

2316
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:52,649
there's like there's there's a little

2317
02:35:50,879 --> 02:35:54,509
bit of subtraction that needs to be done

2318
02:35:52,649 --> 02:35:59,299
before we freak out a little true that

2319
02:35:54,510 --> 02:36:00,960
she keeps on going and she says oh

2320
02:35:59,299 --> 02:36:02,699
production also has environmental

2321
02:36:00,959 --> 02:36:04,560
consequences it has been charged with

2322
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:05,700
deforestation and high levels of water

2323
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,409
and pesticide use

2324
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:08,851
but as pop becomes more legal and

2325
02:36:07,409 --> 02:36:10,409
mainstream notes Warren outdoor

2326
02:36:08,851 --> 02:36:12,510
producers will have to abide by

2327
02:36:10,409 --> 02:36:15,030
pre-existing in their environmental laws

2328
02:36:12,510 --> 02:36:16,351
just like everyone else in effect that

2329
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:19,170
means indoor production the chief

2330
02:36:16,351 --> 02:36:21,210
climate change that makes indoor

2331
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:22,771
production the chief climate change and

2332
02:36:21,209 --> 02:36:24,479
energy concern according to Warren's

2333
02:36:22,771 --> 02:36:26,311
article while underground indoor

2334
02:36:24,479 --> 02:36:28,049
marijuana production already consumed

2335
02:36:26,310 --> 02:36:30,420
the plenty of energy legalization will

2336
02:36:28,049 --> 02:36:32,329
increase energy use even further as the

2337
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:34,799
industry grows so will its negative

2338
02:36:32,329 --> 02:36:36,450
externality she writes which is why

2339
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:38,399
she's proposing that all states that

2340
02:36:36,450 --> 02:36:39,930
legalize marijuana use should also

2341
02:36:38,399 --> 02:36:42,060
require the growing industry to power

2342
02:36:39,930 --> 02:36:43,680
itself cleanly and it's not without

2343
02:36:42,060 --> 02:36:45,899
precedent starting in October of this

2344
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:48,030
year Boulder County and Colorado will

2345
02:36:45,899 --> 02:36:50,459
require many facilities to directly

2346
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:53,311
offset 100 percent of electricity

2347
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:56,310
propane and natural gas consumption do

2348
02:36:53,310 --> 02:37:03,989
renewables or other means that's a fun

2349
02:36:56,310 --> 02:37:05,430
challenge yeah Warren says she's not

2350
02:37:03,989 --> 02:37:07,739
picking on the marijuana industry with

2351
02:37:05,430 --> 02:37:09,450
her proposals it's just that well we

2352
02:37:07,739 --> 02:37:11,010
don't often have new industries appear

2353
02:37:09,450 --> 02:37:12,659
that use a lot of energy and are likely

2354
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:15,000
to be highly regulated as they become

2355
02:37:12,659 --> 02:37:16,680
legal I think it could actually be a

2356
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,479
marketing tool for the industry says

2357
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:19,979
Warren because if you have people who

2358
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:21,629
are purchasing the product who are the

2359
02:37:19,979 --> 02:37:23,039
type of individual who cares about the

2360
02:37:21,629 --> 02:37:26,250
environment then they would gravitate

2361
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:28,320
toward the green marijuana production

2362
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:30,000
what you saying makes sense because we

2363
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:31,199
are sucking up a lot of power and I've

2364
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,879
thought about it I don't know how to do

2365
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:34,590
it maybe somebody can send me an email

2366
02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:36,869
or something one thing I want to do I

2367
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:38,190
consider myself a pro grower I could

2368
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:39,780
grow you can give me a plant that's half

2369
02:37:38,190 --> 02:37:41,630
dead and in ninety days I'll give you

2370
02:37:39,780 --> 02:37:43,040
some tasty ass buds out of it I

2371
02:37:41,629 --> 02:37:45,369
overcome those problems in a grow room

2372
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,750
now I want some guidance on how to

2373
02:37:45,370 --> 02:37:50,689
lessen my carbon footprint

2374
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:52,939
I recycle my soil but still I have to

2375
02:37:50,689 --> 02:37:54,319
run lights for 12 hours on and 12 hours

2376
02:37:52,939 --> 02:37:57,229
off there's no way around it are there

2377
02:37:54,319 --> 02:37:58,699
other things we can do to kind of lessen

2378
02:37:57,228 --> 02:38:00,529
our carbon footprint if you guys know

2379
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:04,220
send me ideas you can tweet them to me

2380
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:12,020
it's at G fyh podcast you can email me

2381
02:38:04,219 --> 02:38:14,319
to grow from your heart at hotmail.com I

2382
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:17,420
mean you would try to find those

2383
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:20,659
cannabis cultivators we'll start looking

2384
02:38:17,420 --> 02:38:23,059
for places like wine yeah you know

2385
02:38:20,659 --> 02:38:25,909
places they would right next to rivers

2386
02:38:23,059 --> 02:38:27,648
where they can have a water bill talking

2387
02:38:25,909 --> 02:38:29,360
about like my pre-existing indoor grow

2388
02:38:27,648 --> 02:38:31,639
like people that have a home grow or a

2389
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:34,130
small warehouse like I want to find out

2390
02:38:31,639 --> 02:38:36,079
ways that people like us like you you've

2391
02:38:34,129 --> 02:38:38,389
got a traphouse grow I want to see a way

2392
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:39,770
that you can kind of make a little less

2393
02:38:38,389 --> 02:38:42,049
in your electricity bill just see if you

2394
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:44,000
however much it is maybe cut 10% of that

2395
02:38:42,049 --> 02:38:45,500
off absolutely you could definitely do

2396
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,270
that with solar you know I'm saying like

2397
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:48,680
you're just cutting out the hundred

2398
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:51,409
dollars that it takes to run your house

2399
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:53,090
would be a hundred dollars less over a

2400
02:38:51,409 --> 02:38:56,898
year that would add up you know

2401
02:38:53,090 --> 02:39:04,309
tremendously that's 15 - you know quite

2402
02:38:56,898 --> 02:39:06,439
a bit $100 you know the local

2403
02:39:04,309 --> 02:39:08,209
application this is the city of Pueblo

2404
02:39:06,439 --> 02:39:10,880
just required everybody growing doors

2405
02:39:08,209 --> 02:39:13,398
you can't grow outside no in any fashion

2406
02:39:10,879 --> 02:39:15,529
this year that's kind of silly hopefully

2407
02:39:13,398 --> 02:39:17,949
in a year we'll have green house rules

2408
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:20,600
down here but yet they cut it off and

2409
02:39:17,950 --> 02:39:27,170
but not until the very end no you're

2410
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:33,200
talking about six persons in my own

2411
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:37,790
backyard and illegal if you're not on

2412
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:39,920
the game the Sun is not there looking

2413
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:41,420
for more illegal pot grows here and cow

2414
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:43,010
more than they were before we have

2415
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:44,148
legalized cannabis to tell you the truth

2416
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:45,409
because now they want to regulate the

2417
02:39:44,148 --> 02:39:47,359
[ __ ] out of it before they didn't have

2418
02:39:45,409 --> 02:39:49,069
time now it's an issue all right I want

2419
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:53,210
to read which one do we want to do this

do you want to read the one written by

2424
02:39:58,360 --> 02:40:04,251
they're both written by the same person

is writing a lot do you want to do the

2427
02:40:05,751 --> 02:40:19,791
one about racism it says the

2428
02:40:18,411 --> 02:40:21,620
legalization of marijuana in Colorado

2429
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:23,420
hasn't solved the racial disparities in

2430
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:25,490
enforcement the drug policy performers

2431
02:40:23,421 --> 02:40:26,841
had hoped to end with blacks still far

2432
02:40:25,490 --> 02:40:28,640
more likely than whites to be charged

2433
02:40:26,841 --> 02:40:30,831
with pot related crimes a new report

2434
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:32,899
says the report issued Wednesday by the

2435
02:40:30,831 --> 02:40:35,030
pro-legalization drug policy Alliance

2436
02:40:32,899 --> 02:40:36,859
showed that marijuana arrests in

2437
02:40:35,030 --> 02:40:39,051
Colorado all but stopped after voters

2438
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:41,661
made the drug legal in small amounts for

2439
02:40:39,050 --> 02:40:43,729
those 21 and older but the report noted

2440
02:40:41,661 --> 02:40:45,021
continuing racial disparities involving

2441
02:40:43,729 --> 02:40:47,421
the marijuana crimes that remain

2442
02:40:45,021 --> 02:40:50,331
including public use in possession in

2443
02:40:47,421 --> 02:40:52,550
excess of the ounce limit study the

2444
02:40:50,331 --> 02:40:54,229
study examined drug arrests in all 64

2445
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:57,140
Colorado counties for two years before

2446
02:40:54,229 --> 02:40:58,609
and after legalization in 2012 the total

2447
02:40:57,140 --> 02:41:00,950
number of charges for pot possession

2448
02:40:58,610 --> 02:41:05,271
distribution and cultivation plummeted

2449
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:09,319
by almost 95% from about 39,000 in 2010

2450
02:41:05,271 --> 02:41:12,011
to just over 2000 last year that's if it

2451
02:41:09,319 --> 02:41:17,149
only takes an hour of the cops time

2452
02:41:12,011 --> 02:41:20,030
that's 37 cop hours 37,000 37,000 cop

2453
02:41:17,149 --> 02:41:22,100
hours we just reallocated to [ __ ] that's

2454
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:24,261
worth something yeah they could be out

2455
02:41:22,101 --> 02:41:25,280
solving a crime any crime looking for

2456
02:41:24,261 --> 02:41:27,081
your bike that got stolen

2457
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:28,400
yep for something the bad happened I

2458
02:41:27,081 --> 02:41:30,740
don't even want to create crimes in my

2459
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:32,630
head I have to say it has been nice like

2460
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:39,050
not worrying about the bag that's in my

2461
02:41:32,630 --> 02:41:46,490
pocket yeah only crime most marijuana

2462
02:41:39,050 --> 02:41:49,990
consumers like traffic infractions the

2463
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:49,990
only problem is once you pull me over

2464
02:41:56,380 --> 02:42:00,559
here you can have my sweater give me

2465
02:41:58,729 --> 02:42:02,539
five minutes and then when you come back

2466
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:03,469
it smells like yeah all right so I'm

2467
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:04,699
gonna keep reading because we want to

2468
02:42:03,469 --> 02:42:06,198
get through a couple articles even after

2469
02:42:04,699 --> 02:42:07,250
legalization blacks were more likely

2470
02:42:06,199 --> 02:42:08,960
twice as likely

2471
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:12,969
oh sorry I read that wrong blacks were

2472
02:42:08,959 --> 02:42:12,969
more than I've stuttered because

2473
02:42:14,078 --> 02:42:17,949
American would be the correct term

2474
02:42:19,879 --> 02:42:24,558
[Music]

2475
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:35,090
[Music]

2476
02:42:41,738 --> 02:42:47,889
african-american folks were more than

2477
02:42:44,059 --> 02:42:47,889
twice as likely as White's

2478
02:42:52,658 --> 02:43:05,719
oddly you tell us blacks were also more

2479
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:07,818
much more likely to be charged with

2480
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:19,219
illegal cultivation of pot or possession

2481
02:43:07,818 --> 02:43:21,408
of more than an ounce legalization for

2482
02:43:19,219 --> 02:43:22,789
the issues that law enforcement had with

2483
02:43:21,408 --> 02:43:24,618
the black and brown communities that

2484
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:27,229
aren't way Colorado director for the

2485
02:43:24,619 --> 02:43:28,550
drug policy Alliance still the drop-off

2486
02:43:27,228 --> 02:43:30,559
and overall arrest is good news for

2487
02:43:28,549 --> 02:43:32,658
minorities said Tony Newman also of the

2488
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:35,539
drug policy Alliance despite the

2489
02:43:32,658 --> 02:43:37,068
uprising racial disparities the massive

2490
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:39,199
drops and arrests have been enormous ly

2491
02:43:37,068 --> 02:43:44,299
beneficial to people of color Newman

2492
02:43:39,199 --> 02:43:46,310
said is this is this my system or I

2493
02:43:44,299 --> 02:43:52,488
think we stopped referring to people by

2494
02:43:46,309 --> 02:43:52,969
the general the term that I related to

2495
02:43:52,488 --> 02:44:04,850
in there

2496
02:43:52,969 --> 02:44:07,429
I can't even now just based on a largest

2497
02:44:04,850 --> 02:44:08,988
ethnic minority Latinos that's because

2498
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:10,970
data comes from the National incident

2499
02:44:08,988 --> 02:44:12,959
based reporting system system which does

2500
02:44:10,969 --> 02:44:14,879
not tally numbers for Latinos

2501
02:44:12,959 --> 02:44:16,978
one of the region's top officials for

2502
02:44:14,879 --> 02:44:18,778
coordinating drug enforcement of the

2503
02:44:16,978 --> 02:44:22,938
Rocky Mountain high intensity drug

2504
02:44:18,779 --> 02:44:49,710
trafficking area program officers are

2505
02:44:22,939 --> 02:44:51,960
not for marijuana distribution charges

2506
02:44:49,709 --> 02:44:54,238
blacks accounted for about 22% of such

2507
02:44:51,959 --> 02:44:56,969
arrests in 2010 and around 18 percent in

2508
02:44:54,238 --> 02:44:58,529
2014 the arrest data got a mixed

2509
02:44:56,969 --> 02:45:00,659
response from the regional head of the

2510
02:44:58,529 --> 02:45:02,069
n-double a-c-p if the head of the

2511
02:45:00,659 --> 02:45:03,389
n-double a-c-p know that you were

2512
02:45:02,068 --> 02:45:07,350
calling them blacks when you wrote this

2513
02:45:03,389 --> 02:45:09,478
on the overall decrease in arrests

2514
02:45:07,350 --> 02:45:11,250
charges and cases ignored is enormous ly

2515
02:45:09,478 --> 02:45:13,670
beneficial to communities of color who

2516
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:15,988
bore the brunt of marijuana prohibition

2517
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:17,760
rosemary Harris little said in a

2518
02:45:15,988 --> 02:45:20,039
statement however we are concerned with

2519
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:21,898
the rise in a disparity for the charge

2520
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:23,520
of public consumption and Cha and

2521
02:45:21,898 --> 02:45:26,219
challenged law enforcement to ensure

2522
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:29,159
this reality is not a discriminatory in

2523
02:45:26,219 --> 02:45:32,459
any manner wow that was hard to read I

2524
02:45:29,159 --> 02:45:34,079
in 2014 the years the year Colorado's

2525
02:45:32,459 --> 02:45:36,329
recreational marijuana stores opened

2526
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:38,010
blacks were three point nine percent of

2527
02:45:36,329 --> 02:45:39,750
the population but accounted for nine

2528
02:45:38,010 --> 02:45:41,430
point two percent of pop possession

2529
02:45:39,750 --> 02:45:43,978
arrests for illegal marijuana

2530
02:45:41,430 --> 02:45:47,159
cultivation this disparities didn't just

2531
02:45:43,978 --> 02:45:48,750
persist they got much worse in 2010

2532
02:45:47,159 --> 02:45:50,369
White's in Colorado were slightly more

2533
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:52,620
likely than blacks to be arrested for

2534
02:45:50,370 --> 02:45:54,420
growing pot after legalization the

2535
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:56,399
arrests rate for whites dropped in

2536
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:59,370
traumatically but ticked up for blacks

2537
02:45:56,398 --> 02:46:02,309
in 2014 the arrest rate for blacks was

2538
02:45:59,370 --> 02:46:03,359
roughly 2.5 times higher there's a lot

2539
02:46:02,309 --> 02:46:05,670
more of this article but I'm not gonna

2540
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:21,050
read it it's almost done

2541
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:21,049
but we get the point in the 60s

2542
02:46:23,978 --> 02:46:28,119
but yeah this strikes me as a little bit

2543
02:46:25,809 --> 02:46:54,818
odd do you Mike tell me do you dislike

2544
02:46:28,120 --> 02:47:07,090
all of us in public you wouldn't want to

2545
02:46:54,818 --> 02:47:10,510
say she stated in a courtroom you know I

2546
02:47:07,090 --> 02:47:14,049
mean or politics I mean let's just be

2547
02:47:10,510 --> 02:47:15,550
real though no civil rights I don't even

2548
02:47:14,049 --> 02:47:19,119
want to be called the whites over here

2549
02:47:15,549 --> 02:47:22,228
the whites and they're not the blacks

2552
02:47:34,469 --> 02:47:43,559
don't a lot but it's still high for

2553
02:47:37,779 --> 02:47:46,029
black my head that's roughly 22,000

2554
02:47:43,559 --> 02:47:49,778
people of color that didn't get a rest

2555
02:47:46,029 --> 02:47:57,640
or [ __ ] with last year but still the

2556
02:47:49,779 --> 02:47:59,050
data so we your opinion on that article

2557
02:47:57,639 --> 02:48:00,519
the people that are listening tweet me

2558
02:47:59,049 --> 02:48:10,209
email me you know how to do it I said it

2559
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:17,350
earlier written a racist racist to say

2560
02:48:10,209 --> 02:48:20,978
it that way Colorado bill seeks to

2561
02:48:17,350 --> 02:48:23,620
standardize marijuana testing what I've

2562
02:48:20,978 --> 02:48:25,148
noticed is a lot of people in Colorado

2563
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:26,710
don't trust the testing facilities

2564
02:48:25,148 --> 02:48:28,510
anymore because we'll take a test to one

2565
02:48:26,709 --> 02:48:30,039
lab and it'll come out at 22 percent you

2566
02:48:28,510 --> 02:48:32,109
can take another test to another lab

2567
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:33,460
he'll come out of 29 percent and of

2568
02:48:32,109 --> 02:48:34,930
course everyone's gonna start going to

2569
02:48:33,459 --> 02:48:35,929
the lab that gets higher tests because

2570
02:48:34,930 --> 02:48:40,189
you want to be able to brag about

2571
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:41,779
higher results so it's there's no real

2572
02:48:40,189 --> 02:48:43,340
standard for the testing lab so we can

2573
02:48:41,779 --> 02:48:51,050
all just open our own lab pretty much

2574
02:48:43,340 --> 02:48:52,728
and be like AHA the testing labs those

2575
02:48:51,049 --> 02:48:55,608
high-dollar people couldn't pay more for

2576
02:48:52,728 --> 02:48:57,198
better testing roads so Colorado is

2577
02:48:55,609 --> 02:48:59,059
moving to establish another marijuana

2578
02:48:57,199 --> 02:49:01,340
first the first government standards for

2579
02:48:59,059 --> 02:49:02,869
marijuana testing a bill approved by its

2580
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:04,279
first committee in the state legislature

2581
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:06,829
on Thursday would create a statewide

2582
02:49:04,279 --> 02:49:09,260
laboratory standard for the state's 18

2583
02:49:06,829 --> 02:49:10,340
pot testing labs currently the labs are

2584
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:11,960
certified by the state health

2585
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:13,460
authorities but they don't have uniform

2586
02:49:11,959 --> 02:49:15,799
rules for testing pot potency

2587
02:49:13,459 --> 02:49:18,139
homogeneity and contaminants as required

2588
02:49:15,799 --> 02:49:19,938
by state law lab owners say they need

2589
02:49:18,139 --> 02:49:22,579
the standards because different labs now

2590
02:49:19,939 --> 02:49:24,529
produce very different results existing

2591
02:49:22,579 --> 02:49:26,120
pot tests generally just looked for

2592
02:49:24,529 --> 02:49:28,430
whether the drug whether the drug is

2593
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:30,250
present not how strong it is in most

2594
02:49:28,430 --> 02:49:33,380
industries there are long established

2595
02:49:30,250 --> 02:49:35,209
long established processes said he and

2596
02:49:33,379 --> 02:49:38,028
bérenger owner of a pot testing lab

2597
02:49:35,209 --> 02:49:39,709
called rm3 however for cannabis like

2598
02:49:38,029 --> 02:49:41,930
most of the industry we're making up the

2599
02:49:39,709 --> 02:49:44,629
rules as we go along I'm glad he admits

2600
02:49:41,930 --> 02:49:45,439
that the labs can currently be used or

2601
02:49:44,629 --> 02:49:46,969
did I click there we go

2602
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:49,040
the labs can currently be used by

2603
02:49:46,969 --> 02:49:50,869
licensed marijuana producers the bill

2604
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:52,729
was amended to remove lab access to

2605
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:54,590
private individuals and industrial hemp

2606
02:49:52,728 --> 02:49:56,988
growers now covered in separate bills

2607
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:58,880
still pending in the legislature which

2608
02:49:56,988 --> 02:50:01,100
kind of bars me from getting my cannabis

2609
02:49:58,879 --> 02:50:02,809
tested now the stuff that I used to grow

2610
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:04,220
up my private girl for my patients I was

2611
02:50:02,809 --> 02:50:05,568
able to take that to the lab and get it

2612
02:50:04,219 --> 02:50:07,549
tested and we could see what was in

2613
02:50:05,568 --> 02:50:10,510
there I think we all need access to that

2614
02:50:07,549 --> 02:50:13,039
I don't understand why they cut us off

2615
02:50:10,510 --> 02:50:14,930
this is the latest step in a dance

2616
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:17,060
that's been going on for ten years

2617
02:50:14,930 --> 02:50:19,550
like I remember we didn't have testing

2618
02:50:17,059 --> 02:50:21,289
labs because the existing labs that had

2619
02:50:19,549 --> 02:50:23,358
the equipment and the know-how are

2620
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:25,310
banned from working with candidates

2621
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:27,380
because they all require FDA a federal

2622
02:50:25,309 --> 02:50:28,909
license yeah so we had to build these

2623
02:50:27,379 --> 02:50:31,028
from the ground up I didn't know there

2624
02:50:28,909 --> 02:50:33,559
were 18 in the state that's pretty cool

2625
02:50:31,029 --> 02:50:34,609
it's a separate bill advanced Thursday

2626
02:50:33,559 --> 02:50:36,469
in a Senate committee would allow

2627
02:50:34,609 --> 02:50:38,899
industrial hemp growers to use the labs

2628
02:50:36,469 --> 02:50:40,398
to Colorado currently allows farmers to

2629
02:50:38,898 --> 02:50:42,858
grow hemp marijuana's non-intoxicating

2630
02:50:40,398 --> 02:50:44,988
cousin but only if the plans fall below

2631
02:50:42,859 --> 02:50:47,710
a threshold for the plants intoxicating

2632
02:50:44,988 --> 02:50:49,368
ingredient THC it's not an ingredient

2633
02:50:47,709 --> 02:50:51,528
however the farmers

2634
02:50:49,369 --> 02:50:53,389
can take their plants to a lab to make

2635
02:50:51,529 --> 02:50:55,158
sure they're meeting the standard the

2636
02:50:53,388 --> 02:50:56,838
testing bill creates what's called a

2637
02:50:55,158 --> 02:50:59,418
reference library a standard set of

2638
02:50:56,838 --> 02:51:01,939
protocols for testing pot the lab owner

2639
02:50:59,418 --> 02:51:04,248
said the state means to essentially

2640
02:51:01,939 --> 02:51:06,529
referee all the methodologies that were

2641
02:51:04,248 --> 02:51:08,119
using we all understand the need to

2642
02:51:06,529 --> 02:51:09,918
reveal the special sauce we've been

2643
02:51:08,119 --> 02:51:12,109
using to further the industry behringer

2644
02:51:09,918 --> 02:51:14,359
said the bill now heads to a separate

2645
02:51:12,109 --> 02:51:16,818
committee before consideration by the

2646
02:51:14,359 --> 02:51:20,449
full house full house I just watch that

2647
02:51:16,818 --> 02:51:22,759
I agree this needs to happen do we need

2648
02:51:20,449 --> 02:51:24,770
to know this is huge it's one of the

2649
02:51:22,759 --> 02:51:26,929
beautiful parts of legalization is it's

2650
02:51:24,770 --> 02:51:28,838
it's like everything else these guys are

2651
02:51:26,929 --> 02:51:31,459
the regulators they need to be regulated

2652
02:51:28,838 --> 02:51:32,568
people the testing labs for sure need to

2653
02:51:31,459 --> 02:51:34,549
know what they're doing they all me and

2654
02:51:32,568 --> 02:51:36,559
using the same equipment playing by the

2655
02:51:34,549 --> 02:51:39,229
same rules we're gonna start seeing

2656
02:51:36,559 --> 02:51:41,648
reality in our testing but you can spot

2657
02:51:39,228 --> 02:51:44,628
[ __ ] on the shelf if you're us I

2658
02:51:41,648 --> 02:51:53,838
know your flower doesn't have 40% THC

2659
02:51:44,629 --> 02:51:59,409
the claims they have a 30% strain and

2660
02:51:53,838 --> 02:51:59,408
I've seen it and it's mid it is not 30%

2661
02:52:02,329 --> 02:52:07,638
[Music]

2662
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:29,809
[Music]

2663
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:31,009
it was like definitely like but now with

2664
02:52:29,809 --> 02:52:32,898
these testing labs if we get them all

2665
02:52:31,009 --> 02:52:34,879
standardized and regulated then we won't

2666
02:52:32,898 --> 02:52:36,679
have to worry like if you're like this

2667
02:52:34,879 --> 02:52:39,259
hash was tested super clean and super

2668
02:52:36,679 --> 02:52:40,549
high in potency like where'd you get it

2669
02:52:39,259 --> 02:52:42,138
done did you get it at the place that

2670
02:52:40,549 --> 02:52:46,489
you pay a lot more and they just give

2671
02:52:42,138 --> 02:52:48,228
you really high reasonably small if you

2672
02:52:46,488 --> 02:52:49,458
gotta test it steep hill I trust you but

2673
02:52:48,228 --> 02:52:51,438
I don't know any of the other places

2674
02:52:49,459 --> 02:52:53,569
steep hill gave me a tour of their

2675
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:55,219
facility and showed me what's going on

2676
02:52:53,568 --> 02:52:56,898
they blew my mind all the other places

2677
02:52:55,218 --> 02:52:58,519
you just give them a sample and they

2678
02:52:56,898 --> 02:52:59,309
drive away and send you an email later

2679
02:52:58,520 --> 02:53:02,280
there

2680
02:52:59,309 --> 02:53:06,899
they're they're 100% cannabis - correct

2681
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:09,260
yeah that's right I'm just saying

2682
02:53:06,899 --> 02:53:14,219
they're not another laboratory like

2683
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:16,079
science stuff in here more important is

2684
02:53:14,219 --> 02:53:17,849
we just required that all edible dose

2685
02:53:16,079 --> 02:53:20,430
and be pretty much perfect

2686
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:31,140
yeah you guys remember how that first

2687
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:38,340
regulatory check went through zero and

2688
02:53:31,139 --> 02:53:39,659
appear what's going on there are a whole

2689
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:41,940
bunch of companies that couldn't make it

2690
02:53:39,659 --> 02:53:44,340
and then we had new rules that require

2691
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:48,270
that only ten milligrams of THC are in

2692
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:58,260
each easily identifiable segment which

2693
02:53:48,270 --> 02:54:05,040
meant no more 450 milligrams I pulled

2694
02:53:58,260 --> 02:54:11,309
one out of the fridge one of the podcast

2695
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:32,370
almost I want I want this 1,200

2696
02:54:11,309 --> 02:54:47,129
milligrams challenge you know just want

2697
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:50,400
to drop down I don't know if you want to

2698
02:54:47,129 --> 02:54:52,049
do it the news articles I want to talk

02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:04,970
we didn't get a lot talked about that

2704
02:55:02,690 --> 02:55:09,800
the community was we was there it

2705
