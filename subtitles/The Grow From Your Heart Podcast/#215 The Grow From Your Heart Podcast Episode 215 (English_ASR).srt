00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,039
it comes out fresh no matter what day of

26
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,420
the week it is what time it is wherever

you are hope you're having a good time

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,680
over here smoking a Fed joint maybe

29
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,319
taking a DAB with me I've been smoking

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,130
on the I've got some Three Rivers

31
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,859
distillate I've got some Three Rivers

32
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:15,500
organics dub wise distillate it was

33
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,870
grown by me it was actually extracted by

34
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,209
the folks at pure distilled I'm really

35
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,010
enjoying the Three Rivers dub wise

36
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,409
distillate it's pretty nice I've been

37
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,540
talking a lot about the HCF SC and the

38
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,129
HTF SE the high cannabinoid

39
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,070
full-spectrum extract and the high

40
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:33,140
terpene full-spectrum extract and all

41
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,478
those extracts I'm not sure if I prefer

42
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,079
the distillate or the hdfs II to tell

43
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,368
you the truth to treat my most of you

44
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,560
folks that listen to the podcast know

45
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,090
I've got a little traumatic brain injury

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,890
and sometimes it [ __ ] with me and I

47
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,420
think smoking a fat dab of distillate is

48
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,719
the quickest way to make my head noise

49
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,280
go away but sometimes I really enjoy the

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,560
effects of the high cannabinoid

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,969
full-spectrum extract crystals and a

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,430
nice chunky dab I'm not sure which I

53
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,289
prefer so they're in competition they're

54
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,320
both trying to win my heart we will see

55
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,940
which one wins where do we start

56
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,649
let's talk about this thermal banger

57
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,259
I've had an evil week I hope you guys

58
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,219
have had as good of a week as I have on

59
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,810
Wednesday I had a an adventurous day I

60
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:18,050
started off by heading to elevate

61
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,580
elevate glass 517 South Tejon I picked

62
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,920
up in Colorado Springs I picked up a

63
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,930
brand new thermal banger let me explain

64
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,309
this thermal banger a little bit let me

65
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,379
explain to normal banger and then we

66
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,229
will kind of describe the thermal banger

67
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,439
so a normal banger a banger fits on a

68
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:36,379
hash pipe a bubbler a small bong I

69
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,849
prefer a very small dab rig so this is

70
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,889
the part that you actually will put the

71
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,919
dab into this part fits on your hash

72
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,349
pipe your bubble or your small bong your

73
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,059
little dab rig a hitman sidecar or a

74
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,949
little mad Rob or a little Toro piece

75
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,140
this piece fits on there this is the

76
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:53,179
part you heat up you put the dab into

77
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,599
here it kind of looks like it could be

78
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,129
just a normal bowl it's got a stem that

79
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,319
comes up and then it's got a 90-degree

80
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,019
angle and then there is a quartz just a

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,340
dish I just looks like just don't you

82
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,719
keep that up and then you put your dab

83
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,098
in there and then you put a carve cap on

84
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,859
it and you take a dab

85
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:11,149
it's just a normal dish it just looks

86
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:13,969
like you took a dish like it maybe a

87
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,709
thimble and then attached it to a way to

88
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:18,019
put it onto the bong or onto your rig

89
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,579
so and the idea is you heat that up and

90
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,079
they let it cool a little bit you put

91
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,760
the dab in there and cover with a carb

92
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,129
cap in the carp cap Stokes the heat and

93
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,479
then you get a nice healthy dab with the

94
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:28,489
thermal banger this is a little bit

95
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,518
different it's like they took the

96
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,468
original idea of the banger and then on

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,209
the inside they put another piece of

98
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:39,138
glass which is where the dab will

99
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,030
actually go so it's hard to explain it's

100
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,069
like a it's like a thimble with another

101
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,329
thimble inside of it basically and

102
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,589
they're both made out of glass it's all

103
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,620
made out of glass it's supposed to be

104
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,449
quartz these are glass so um you heat

105
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,949
the outside of this thermal Boehner and

106
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:54,469
the House earlier of the glass gets

107
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:57,409
really hot the glass on the inside does

108
00:03:54,468 --> 00:04:00,019
not get hot you drop your dab into the

109
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:03,259
glass on the inside and you cap it now

110
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,000
this does a few things first of all the

111
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:06,768
dab you just drop down there doesn't

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,438
come in contact with the heated surface

113
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,060
so it doesn't cool the nail down super

114
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,448
quickly when you're taking large dabs

115
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,129
sometimes the hash will cool the nail

116
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,109
and it will steal your heat so you don't

117
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,579
get all the dab so that can't happen

118
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,649
with this because you're not actually

119
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:26,720
putting the the dab on the heated

120
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:28,728
surface also I gives it low tip we say

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,259
low temps for taste you gotta taste

122
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:32,689
wasted to taste it

123
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,120
lower temps for better turps I have

124
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,219
realized that is not how I want to dab I

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,740
like hot dabs I like my sheet a little

126
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,659
bit too hot I am in the glow squad I

127
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,340
want to burn myself I don't like wasting

128
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:45,348
hash I like going at it too hot and

129
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,119
making sure I get it all I do not feel

130
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,069
like the thermal banger is something

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,319
that I'm going to enjoy I'm gonna keep

132
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,959
giving it a few tries I might test it I

133
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,218
liked watching the hdfs II burn in it it

134
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,649
seemed to melt a little bit differently

135
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:59,870
a puddle differently but it is not my

136
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:03,288
style you guys the the thermal Boehner

137
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,959
is not Rasta Jeff approved I may have to

138
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:07,279
get a different carb cap I may have bare

139
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,228
foot come over and show me how to use it

140
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,459
a little differently but so far from

141
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,620
what I've played with and what I've seen

142
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:14,718
my friends do with it that is not my

143
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,180
style it's for low temp dabbing I like

144
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:19,218
these hot hot and hurty long burnin dabs

145
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,110
so I don't know that the thermal banger

146
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,699
is for me and I turn a basher

147
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,900
actually I want you to go by one and try

148
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,189
it see what you think let me know what

149
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,439
you think about the thermal banger I got

150
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,730
mine at elevate glass at 5:17 South Bay

151
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,180
hone in beautiful downtown Colorado

152
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,860
Springs Colorado go there get one see

153
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,110
what you think about it shot my friends

154
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,879
at elevate so I was talking about my

155
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,129
amazing day on Wednesday let's talk a

156
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,649
little bit more about that other than

157
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:45,439
getting the thermal Bangor we headed up

158
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,359
to Denver and I started my evening with

159
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,370
a Metallica concert it's right we headed

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,910
up to Denver and there were two opening

161
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,410
acts

162
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,180
I think the first band was called

163
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,060
volbeat and then after that it was

164
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,709
Avenged Sevenfold no offense to anybody

165
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,470
that's into either of those bands or

166
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:02,149
those bands I purposefully missed them I

167
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,700
was not into those bands at all I went

168
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:07,129
to see Metallica I'm not really into the

169
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,050
hard rock metal thing honestly but I

170
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,209
grew up on Metallica Metallica was my

171
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,650
first favorite band I think there may

172
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,759
have been bands before that when I was a

173
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,750
little kid and didn't know any better

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,728
but I think when I was becoming in a

175
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,009
rebellious teenager I think Metallica is

176
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:24,349
what helped me do that I used to wear a

177
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,000
Metallica shirt every day my closet was

178
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,379
just filled with black Metallica shirts

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,918
I had all of them if they put out a

180
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,000
Metallica shirt in that era I had it

181
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,288
I've been a Metallica fan for a long

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,149
time I'm a drummer

183
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:38,478
I've played drums I think I got drums

184
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:40,489
for my 14th or 15th birthday uh and the

185
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,430
drummer from Metallica was the dude that

186
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,620
inspired me so I was about probably 13

187
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,060
or 14 years old and my uncles they're

188
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,519
bad influences on me but they're really

189
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,500
cool dudes they decided to take me to a

190
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,149
concert in California I'd never been to

191
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,889
a big Stadium concert I'd been to like

192
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,049
little shitty gigs and stuff but I'd

193
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,269
never been to a real concert so my

194
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,210
uncle's Ron and Eric shout out dudes

195
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:03,949
ah they took me to see some shitty bands

196
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:06,799
they took me to see Jackyl and the Damn

197
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,509
Yankees it's not the coolest bands on

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
the planet but when you're a 14 year old

199
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,860
kid or a 13 year old kid bucking drums

200
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,600
and guitars and loud and lots of people

201
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,900
and we're looking freaks and boobs

202
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,030
everywhere it was a great time so how

203
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,060
does Metallica tie into that my uncle's

204
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,728
my uncle Eric had a Chevy El Camino it's

205
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,860
like a super [ __ ] white trash

206
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:29,959
Rockstar ride that's like a truck it's

207
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,490
kind of lowered but it had a camper

208
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,989
shell on it so my uncles were in the

209
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,400
front and I was in the back part where

210
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,410
the camper shell is and

211
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,870
was no window between us and them are

212
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,030
between myself in them and they smoked

213
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,709
the joint and put on the black album I'd

214
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,689
been smoking a little bit of weed with a

215
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,629
friend of mine but not regularly I

216
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:48,978
hadn't I hadn't become a pothead yet

217
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,930
they put on the black album

218
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:52,339
it starts with inner sandman and then

219
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,689
it's sad but true and I think it's

220
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,538
through than ever maybe you're holier

221
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,589
than now but enter sandman' and sad but

222
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:59,029
true we're all you [ __ ] me that

223
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,339
starts the whole album off it starts the

224
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,819
whole day off perfectly ah they smoked

225
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,319
the joint

226
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:04,668
I'm pretty sure I got a little stone

227
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,139
from the joint that they smoked in the

228
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,159
front of the car cuz they just hotbox

229
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,228
that [ __ ] they rolled up the windows

230
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,580
and smoked on the highway so all the

231
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:14,269
smoke came to the back of the car where

232
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:16,668
I was I got good and stoned that day I

233
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,698
decided I was going to be a drummer I

234
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:21,228
knew that I had to play the drums and

235
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,139
that joint that my uncle smoked and

236
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:26,990
Metallica and that adventure that day

237
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,430
changed me and that told me that day hey

238
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,780
you're gonna be a drummer this is part

239
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,400
of your [ __ ] life this is what you're

240
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,079
gonna do so I've been in Metallica a

241
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,179
huge Metallica fans since then I was

242
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,919
already a Metallica fan but that's what

243
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,718
sold me getting stoned with my older

244
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,098
uncles on accident I don't even think

245
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,180
they realize they were getting me high

246
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,330
in the car they were just doing their

247
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,649
own thing but I got stoned with them saw

248
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,850
a great concert and then they just

249
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,649
changed my life now I'm sure that the

250
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,310
next day I was obnoxious air-drumming on

251
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,600
everything

252
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,159
drumming on the desk at school actually

253
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,509
got kicked out of several classes in

254
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,000
school it continued all the way through

255
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,500
my high school career ah I got kicked

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
out of all my classes for drumming on

257
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,370
the desk and eventually my last year of

258
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,639
high school I only had band classes

259
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,320
that's not a joke alright so I drove it

260
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,850
and saw metallica metallica was [ __ ]

261
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,670
awesome you guys Sports Authority Field

262
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,759
is huge [ __ ] trying to park at that

263
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,379
place it took me no joke 30 maybe 45

264
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,289
maybe an hour to find a parking place

265
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,149
eventually I ended up paying $25 for a

266
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,949
parking space ended up paying 20 more

267
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:25,009
dollars for a pedal cab to get me from

268
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,509
that parking space to the venue it was

269
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,458
worth the ride it was worth paying a

270
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,659
little dude to pedal me around he was

271
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,129
pretty cool he knew a lot of stuff about

272
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:34,370
Denver knew about the area that was

273
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:35,929
helpful so man [ __ ] parking but once we

274
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,129
got there it was cool once we got into

275
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:39,319
the video was cool I timed it

276
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:41,059
beautifully we got some food on the way

277
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,260
we stopped at elevate of course we hit

278
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,549
some traffic there was a little bit of

279
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,740
rain we had to drive around and find

280
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,629
parking once we got into the venue we

281
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,810
had time to find we got some snacks we

282
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,879
got

283
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,469
slice of pizza we got some drinks just

284
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,149
just cokes you guys no beer nothing I

285
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:57,080
don't go crazy I don't drink at all um

286
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,459
and so we found our seats and we looked

287
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,410
around and I talked to the guy next

288
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,610
music what's up bro it's going man and

289
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,139
apparently the guy in front of me was

290
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,210
super drunk and being an [ __ ] trying

291
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,769
to talk to everybody he did not want to

292
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,629
talk to me so that was cool

293
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:11,809
Metallica came out shortly after that

294
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:14,000
and did quite a few cool songs they did

295
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,819
mostly new stuff they did the Atlas rise

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,740
and they did uh there's another one that

297
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,589
I can't [ __ ] hardwired to

298
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,089
self-destruct they did those I'm not a

299
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,430
huge fan of the new stuff it's really

300
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,470
cool I just like everybody says everyone

301
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:29,059
that's a fan of music they all like the

302
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,379
old stuff better everybody just says I

303
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,939
want to hear the old stuff and that's

304
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,909
kind of how I felt about it I'm looking

305
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,350
at my phones I made a note really a list

306
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:38,179
of songs that they play but I cannot

307
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,940
find it here I know I have it in my

308
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,528
phone anyway um they were jamming

309
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,060
they're rocking out they did for Whom

310
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:47,000
the Bell Tolls and they did another song

311
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,799
and then after that the band looked kind

312
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,809
of confused they were like I'm not sure

313
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,939
what's happening here and then they all

314
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:56,029
walked off the stage and a dude came on

315
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,220
the microphone over the PA system and he

316
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,769
said hey guys we're not canceling the

317
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,210
show but there's a major lightning storm

318
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,370

319
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,810

320
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,970
like there's a major lightning storm we

321
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:10,819
need everybody to exit the grandstand

322
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,560

323
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,030

324

326
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,990
get up out of our seats and go find

327
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,799
shelter basically from the rain and from

328
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,870
the lightning in the concourse at Sports

329
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,519
Authority Field it was crowded it was

330
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,839
obnoxious people were smoking and

331
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,850
blowing [ __ ] cigarette smoke in my

332
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,060
face half the people were drunk and

333
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,070
ridiculous but I knew that if I waited

334
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:38,179
there was more Metallica so I'm

335
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,230
scrolling through my phone so Lee here

336
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:40,879
because I made a couple of notes on

337
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,670
songs that they played and can't find

338
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:48,689
the note which is weird

339
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:50,309
but anyway Metallica did come back on we

340
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,600
made it back to our seats Metallica came

341
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,729
back on ah

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,740
they played I think they played

343
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,060
motorbreath at that point and then they

344
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,620
talked for a couple of seconds James

345
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,259
Hetfield actually gave a little bit of a

346
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,029
speech he's like hey uh I forgot exactly

347
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,620
how he said it but he talked about I

348
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,850
don't care if you voted for this guy I

349
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,110
don't care if you voted for that guy I

350
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,370
don't care if you drink this I don't

351
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,750
care if you smoke that I don't care if

352
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,940
you believe in a God won't care for you

353
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,649
don't believe in a god he's basically

354
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,120
said we're here to [ __ ] party and

355
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,679
listened to Metallica so we're all

356
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,750
[ __ ] friends [ __ ] all that [ __ ]

357
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,089
which I thought was kind of cool then

358
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,679
they played then James asked do you guys

359
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,389
want some hard stuff and of course the

360
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,829
crowd was like yeah and James Austin

361
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,330
James Hetfield from Metallica is kind of

362
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,370
funny he tries to be a comedian on stage

363
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,420
he's pretty good front dude things like

364
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,710
you guys want to hear some hard stuff

365
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,139
and of course the crowd was like [ __ ]

366
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,300
yeah so that's when I really feel like

367
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,840
Metallica started firing it up they did

368
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:42,029
sad but true then they did one followed

369
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,620
by master of puppets followed by

370
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,240
creeping death then they brought out

371
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,279
they brought out another drum set and

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,840
set it at the very front edge of the

373
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,120
stage you guys this was at Sports

374
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,920
Authority Field I was a mile away it was

375
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,960
a mile high plus I was a mile away from

376
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,029
the [ __ ] stage everybody looked like

377
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,560
they were about 1/4 inch tall from where

378
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,500
I could see him the drumset was just a

379
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,899
blur the backdrop was amazing the blood

380
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,789
the backdrop was so cool they had 50

381
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,620
foot tall video screens they would play

382
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,129
videos on the pyrotechnics were pretty

383
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,549
cool

384
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:16,259
it was pretty bitchin ah so then they

385
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:17,759
did seek-and-destroy on the front of the

386
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,240
stage like that then they did fight fire

387
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,250
with fire

388
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,680
I've been there a couple more songs that

389
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,850
I did not make a note of they shredded

390
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,169
for a little while longer

391
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,420
I remember hearing creeping death in

392
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:29,429
there fade to black was in there then

393
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,649
they on court of course with [ __ ]

394
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,209
Enter Sandman everybody's saying enter

395
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,269
sandman' it was a great show lots of

396
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:38,820
great pyrotechnics I like I said I was a

397
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,250
mile away I was in the back section of

398
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,290
the Sports Authority Field and when some

399
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,059
of the pyrotechnics would go off I could

400
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,529
feel the heat I could tell that my date

401
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,209
was cold because it was getting chilly

402
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,189
and it was raining I could tell that she

403
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,810
would feel relieved when some of the

404
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,520
pyrotechnics would go off she'd be like

405
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:56,069
Oh warm then she would reach to it like

406
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,460
a little heater so Metallica was [ __ ]

407
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,160
awesome

408
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,769
Metallica shredded all night

409
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,230
it the show ended it took us a little

410
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,669
bit to get out of there because humans

411
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,278
are [ __ ] cattle and they're half

412
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:11,479
[ __ ] but once we got out of there we

413
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:14,000
made it to the car and then we headed to

414
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,129
servantes other side at Five Points in

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,169
Denver because one of my favorite reggae

416
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,569
artists Capleton was playing at

417
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:23,149
servantes other side when we walked in

418
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,799
he was already playing I feel like you'd

419
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:27,409
only been going for a few songs because

420
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:30,859
he went for a good 45 minutes to an hour

421
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:33,620
or so after we got there ah man Capleton

422
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,839

423

so much pyrotechnics the Capleton show

435
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:04,039
was a small club shows a small I'm gonna

436
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:05,388
say maybe three maybe five hundred

437
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,909
people there there couldn't have been

438
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,100
five hundred people in that club but

439
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:12,649
every single person was paying attention

440
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,069
to every single moment of that Capleton

441
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:17,720
concert he speaks the way he speaks you

442
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,818
just have to listen you cannot turn your

443
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,769
head when Capleton speaks he really gets

444
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,729
your attention so I had a huge weekend

honestly you guys the first 50 videos

488
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,940
are a mess there's not a lot of effort

489
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,440
put into them because I'm just trying to

490
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,390
get them out there and get caught up

491
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,040
once I get caught up the videos will get

492
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,480
better I know what I'm doing now I've

493
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,699
played with iMovie enough to kind of

494
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,750
have a little clue on it so I just need

495
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,340
to take some time

496
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,950
make some effort and get caught up it

497
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,110
takes however long the podcast is it

498
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,720
takes about 2 or 3 times that amount of

499
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,190
time to make the video for it plus it

500
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,110
takes like another 2 hours for it to

501
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,610
upload and while it's uploading I can't

502
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,709
make another I can't work on the

503
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:15,889
computer very much because the way that

504
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,690
iMovie works it just if you change

505
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,910
anything it [ __ ] everything up so I

506
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,039
kind of kind of ties up my computer for

507
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,660
2 or 3 hours so I try to make the videos

508
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,250
at night and then launch one up before I

509
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,750
go to bed and then I'll make another one

510
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,369
early in the morning and start launching

511
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,380
it to YouTube before I go to work so

512
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,929
that way it's loading while I'm busy

513
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,400
anyway the videos are happening that's

514
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,660
the point and I would appreciate it if

515
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,810
you subscribe that's a way for you to

516
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,009
listen to old episodes so also I want to

517
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,210
know what you think of the Thursday

518
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,490
episodes I've been putting out I've been

519
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,110
putting out old old episodes blocks of

520
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,910
old episodes on Thursdays I'm calling it

521
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,349
throwback Thursday let me know what you

522
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,640
think of that a few people have emailed

523
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:52,219
me and said that they'd appreciate it

524
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,570
one person asked me to put the titles of

525
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,029
the old episodes in there so they know

526
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,919
what they're listening for I will try to

527
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:59,359
remember to do that but honestly it's a

528
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,980
lot of work and sometimes I don't even

529
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,509
listen to the old episodes I just have

530
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,069
to make the chunks of shows and put them

531
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,660
out and get them to you because I am a

532
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:07,220
little bit overwhelmed with all of my

533
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,620
commitments and priorities to tell you

534
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,210

627
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,729
minute so I'm gonna hold off on all this

628
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:13,489
patreon talk let's talk about some ganja

629
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:14,479
related madness all right here's

630
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,879
something I've wanted to talk about

631
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,528
because it's something I've been

632
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:21,588
experiencing you guys ever go through

633
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:23,628
phases where sometimes you can smoke all

634
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:26,028
of the hash or all of the weed and

635
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:27,678
nothing happens like I've got days where

636
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:30,019
I feel like I could just open up my

637
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,820
shatter and just take half gram dabs all

638
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,409
day and I don't get high properly like

639
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,638
I'll get a little bit of a boo for a

640
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:36,109
couple of seconds but then I'm just like

641
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:38,478
that that was fun

642
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:40,098
and it'll last for days like that and

643
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,749
I'll feel like I just smoked all of my

644
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:44,418
hash and all of my weed and I just keep

645
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:47,269
smoking and nothing happens and then one

646
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,769
day it'll flip to where I can think

647
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:51,558
about smoke and some hash and I just

648
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:53,598
feel high as [ __ ] like I'm super high or

649
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,888
some days you just open up the parchment

650
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:56,178
and before you even get the dabber on

651
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,778
the nail you're like wow it's so high

652
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,639
already

653
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:01,398
are there some days I can take just a

654
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:02,988
little dab and get super rekt and it's

655
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:04,758
really odd I've been noticing that I go

656
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,558
through phases where I can smoke all of

657
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,878
the hash and then it'll flip on me and

658
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,618
then I could just barely smoke and get

659
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:11,898
rekt I've been trying to pay attention

660
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:14,478
to a few things and see what causes this

661
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:16,968
and what is related to this the first

662
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:19,278
thing I would say is it's directly

663
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:21,798
related to my hydration if I have not

664
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:23,659
been drinking enough water my lungs hurt

665
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,489
when I take a DAB I can feel it my lungs

666
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,609
are like dude that's hot that's dry [ __ ]

667
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:30,169
you hydrate yourself and how much food I

668
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,908
have consumed and what kind of food have

669
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:34,278
I've had a lot of sugary stuff I can't

670
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:35,899
get high properly sometimes if I've had

671
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,999
too much caffeine and too many sugary

672
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,678
snacks and I take a DAB instead of

673
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:41,808
getting high properly I just get jittery

674
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,909
and anxious and it'll feel good and I

675
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:45,769
have to wait like through the initial

676
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,330
high of the dab to feel okay like a good

677
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,930
fifteen or twenty minutes later once the

678
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:50,149
blood

679
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,860
and the [ __ ] Mountain Dew or the dr.

680
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,380
pepper sugar and the cookies and the dab

681
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:56,959
all stop fighting each other so it's

682
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,770
directly related to my hydration and my

683
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,600
food consumption and my blood sugar I

684
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:04,069
and they all those three together are

685
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,589
the main components and it's mostly

686
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:08,899
hydration because I can take huge dabs

687
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:10,849
if I'm well hydrated if I wake up and

688
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,800
just hydrate heavily and then start

689
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,649
taking big globs I can smoke heavy all

690
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,750
day and my lungs are okay with it if I

691
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,460
don't drink plenty of water and I start

692
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,140
taking big dabs my lungs burn and then

693
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,789
by the late part of the day I don't want

694
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,009
to dab hard anymore and I'm tired and

695
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,230
worn out so I think a lot of my thing is

696
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,210
directly related to hydration which is

697
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,589
directly related to my blood sugar I

698
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,840
feel like when I don't have the right

699
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:34,579
food I get high and I get lazy and I get

700
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:36,649
rekt but if I eat right I get high and I

701
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:40,549
get uplifted and I feel much better I

702
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,259
also think that a lot of my being able

703
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,089
to get really rekt and not being able to

704
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:46,430
get high properly has stuff to do with

705
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,519
the weather when it's really hot outside

706
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,470
I don't even like to get real high I

707
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,849
missed an O I skipped an opportunity to

708
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,890
go smoke with some friends baby because

709
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,449
it was 90 degrees outside there wasn't

710
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,700
anywhere cool to go smoke it was just

711
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,960
too hot and just being in the car if we

712
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,920
would have gone to the car to smoke if

713
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,870
we would have gone somewhere else to

714
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,610
smoke just being outside back in the

715
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,109
heat I'm just gonna [ __ ] ruin my day

716
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,879
and give me a headache and make me lazy

717
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:09,169
so sometimes the weather has stuff to do

718
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,660
with it I don't like to get too blazed

719
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:14,360
in the too hot when it's cold let's

720
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,150
smoke I can smoke like I said I can

721
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:18,079
smoke all of the hash when it's cold

722
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,050
there's just something about it that I

723
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,809
really enjoy being wherever out in the

724
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,339
car out in the backyard camping whatever

725
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,259
alysha's smoke when it's cold I can

726
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,669
handle that my body likes it and it's

727
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:30,740
probably because I'm not getting so

728
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,950
dehydrated and I'm not just trying to

729
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,630
survive and my hydration isn't suffering

730
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,880
another thing that affects my ability to

731
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:41,540
medicate or get high properly is my

732
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,310
stress and anxiety level if I'm stressed

733
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,000
if you guys ever experienced this have

734
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,220
you been

735
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,500
maybe you got high and you went for a

736
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,990
drive or maybe you got high and you had

737
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,640
an experience that some adrenaline

738
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,920
kicked in and you can't be high anymore

739
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,810
have you noticed your high just [ __ ]

740
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,340
goes away at those points or have you

741
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,529
ever had just something scare you and

742
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,429
just blow your whole high like maybe you

743
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,629
get pulled over and

744
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,640
as soon as you see those red and blues

745
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,060
and miraculously I am not even high

746
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,400
anymore

747
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:09,349
I think stress kind of blocks my ability

748
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,870
to get blazed properly if I'm too

749
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:13,429
worried about work or podcasting or

750
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,009
whatever it is that people worry about

751
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,480
nowadays half the time it's dumb [ __ ]

752
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,250
that we [ __ ] invented anyway because

753
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,349
this is just a fake world that we live

754
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,460
in we should be doing totally different

755
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:24,829
[ __ ] than what we do with our lives but

756
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,150
see that that that that stress right

757
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:28,099
there is what I think [ __ ] with my high

758
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,480
sometimes it just doesn't let me get

759
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,669
where I want to be some to stress with

760
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,660
the [ __ ] world and with stupid [ __ ]

761
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,640
also environment I feel like when I

762
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,330
smoke at this table at this spot right

763
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,460
here

764
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,500
I could I could never get too high at

765
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,240
this spot because I'm in my comfort zone

766
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,529
I've got a bottle of dr. pepper right

767
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,870
here I got a bottle of water right here

768
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:49,339
I got all my apothecary jars right here

769
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:50,839
my eye pads right here my bones right

770
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,279
here my computers right here my bed is

771
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:53,959
like 30 steps from here there's a

772
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,109
refrigerator full of goodies right there

773
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,670
I got a TV over there there's not a lot

774
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:01,339
could go wrong in this environment so I

775
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,830
feel like when I smoke right here I get

776
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,779
I allow myself to get pretty high but I

777
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,460
get in a bubble I get in this productive

778
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,990
bubble I want to clean this area up on

779
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,640
organize all this [ __ ] and I want to

780
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,740
start writing podcasts I want to start

781
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,020
just this is my creative zone of my

782
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,079
space right here so when I smoke right

783
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:20,930
here certain things happen but if I were

784
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,849
to go I know I keep talking about the

785
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,310
car sorry Mike sometimes I medicate in

786
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:27,619
my car the vibe is completely different

787
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:29,240
I feel like I get much more medicated

788
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,250
when I smoke in the car because I'm not

789
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,680
in my comfort zone if I'm a passenger or

790
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,799
a driver if I'm out smoking in the car I

791
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,480
get way more blazed because my mind is

792
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,220
more stimulated and I can't just be here

793
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,960
in my bubble when I'm here in my bubble

794
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,910
I don't have to worry about anything my

795
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,470
my sense is no you're safe you could

796
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,390
turn off when I'm out in public

797
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,980
I'm like a [ __ ] deer out in the

798
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,330
danger and everything is just blinking

799
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,490
at me and I got to pay attention to it

800
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:55,309
so I get blazed I see that even more and

801
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,529
I get even higher from it so also I

802
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,240
think when I go to places like the can

803
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,920
of Canyon my high is way different

804
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,349
because it's a social high I've got to

805
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,940
stay I can't get blackout blazed or

806
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:07,579
silent blaze because sometimes I like to

807
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,840
smoke myself into a silent stupor that's

808
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:10,490
what I enjoy when I'm alone then it

809
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,349
makes my mind go and gets me creative

810
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,849
and I just start flowing but I can't do

811
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:15,048
that at places like the canna Canyon

812
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,509
because people want to talk to

813
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:20,118
so I think my environment has a huge

814
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:22,519
part about how my high plays out on how

815
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:24,259
I'm able to get and how much just how

816
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,269
much I noticed maybe I don't notice that

817
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm super high when I'm sitting at this

818
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:30,589
table because nothing can go wrong and

819
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:32,329
maybe you do notice that you're super

820
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,408
blazed after to DAB's when you're out at

821
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,908
the mall just because you feel like

822
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,919
everyone's looking at you just cause

823
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:39,980
you're aware so I think environment

824
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,200
plays a huge part in how high I am and

825
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,909
am not able to get one thing I really

826
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,798
don't like to do but a lot of my friends

827
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:48,200
love to do they like to smoke and then

828
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,849
eat and I am the exact opposite I like

829
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,919
to eat and then when I'm done eating and

830
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:53,599
I don't need anymore food that's when I

831
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,070
toke down and get blazed because I feel

832
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,988
like if I eat right after I smoke I

833
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:58,700
pretty much just wasted the food and I

834
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,288
wasted those dads because they're both

835
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,970
just gonna balance each other out

836
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:03,980
there's gonna dig 8 each other I won't

837
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,440
notice either one so eat a big fat meal

838
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,599
get nice and nourished get comfy then I

839
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,960
chug up a little bit of water then right

840
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:13,219
after that the dad time are you guys

841
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,259
I've been rambling for like 30 minutes

842
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,429
I'm gonna press pause for a minute I'm

843
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:17,538
gonna take one of those dabs I've been

844
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,519
talking about I'm also gonna take a

845
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,618
couple of drinks and then I'll be right

846
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,819
back and we are going to read an email

847
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:26,118
from a listener

848
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:28,339
all right podcast world I am back I got

849
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:29,089
hydrated it definitely took way too many

850
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,069
dabs

851
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:32,988
I was dabbing this lemon Jeffrey high

852
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,668
cannabinoid full-spectrum x-ray with a

853
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:37,009
little bit of Heitor beam full-spectrum

854
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:39,109
extract poured into it with a little bit

855
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:41,599
of dub wise distillate dropped on top of

856
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:44,648
that then I rolled that sticky dab into

857
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:48,048
a little bit of this THC a powder and

858
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:48,918
then I got way too lit mic off for about

859
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:51,319
seven minutes

860
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,389
I blew about a gallon of snot out of my

861
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,918
nose now I think I've got my [ __ ]

862
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:57,019
together and we're gonna try to do a

863
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,309
podcast all right so I got an email from

864
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:00,230
somebody I'm not sure if I'm supposed to

865
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:02,118
use their name I'm not going to we're

866
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,649
just gonna skip that this email comes

867
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:05,089
from a listener and if you'd like to

868
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:07,158
email me you can send me an email it

869
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:09,648
grow from your heart at a hotmail.com

870
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,139
maybe I'll read your email on a future

871
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,849
episode this email goes like this hey

872
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:15,558
brother did I hear that correctly and

873
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:17,898
then he says half asleep on a throwback

874
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:20,690
episode I can't remember where did you

875
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:23,028
say that you switch back to 1864 late

876
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,590
flush do you still do that back in the

877
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,148
Hydra days I would sometimes put them

878
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:27,740
back into total blackout for the last

879
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:30,079
two or three days I've never

880
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,470
her going back to more light would you

881
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,569
mind giving your thoughts behind that uh

882
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,910
to tell you the truth bro I don't think

883
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:40,519
I said that I hope I did not say that I

884
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,679
do remember one instance where that may

885
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,539
be useful I have talked about Reeve

886
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,390
edging your plants the only reason that

887
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:49,490
I would recommend going to more light at

888
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,790
the end of flower would be to revert

889
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:55,220
your plant back to the veg stage that's

890
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:57,589
the only time it's useful do not go back

891
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,420
to 18 6 at the end of flowering if

892
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:01,399
you're going to change your time at the

893
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,190
end of your flower period I would go

894
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:07,400
with more darkness and less light so

895
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:10,250
maybe go from 12 12 to 14 hours of

896
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,410
darkness and 10 hours of light or maybe

897
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,569
increase your dark period but do not add

898
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,340
light to the end of your flowering

899
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:18,678
period that'll [ __ ] your plants up it

900
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:21,049
will confuse them it will make them

901
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,600
think that it's time to revenge they

902
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,639
will start reef edging if you want to

903
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,899
revenge that is something you can do but

904
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,920
if you don't want to revenge the plant

905
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,710
don't do that

906
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,390
you must have been half asleep you might

907
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,829
have been high and it's [ __ ] weird

908
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,179
that you're dreaming about me but please

909
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,289
don't do that and thanks for the email

910
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:37,940
there's more to this email I'm gonna

911
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:39,558
keep reading it says I really like your

912
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,140
show incidentally only recently

913
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:44,210
discovered it keep up the good work keep

914
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,910
up the good hard work ethic the fun and

915
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,519
I appreciate the rallying content which

916
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,179
is always solid I learned stuff I think

917
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,129
new thoughts

918
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:53,840
I respect the point of view - I'm good

919
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,059
with using the content of this email in

920
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,659
any ups in any episodes or not as you

921
00:30:56,058 --> 00:31:02,119
prefer but no name please as I'm not as

922
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,860
I'm in not land so I think he meant to

923
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,869
type I'm in prohibition land or not

924
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:07,669
legal and he skipped the word there but

925
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:09,709
then he says thanks man and he signs his

926
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:14,600
name dude thank you for the great email

927
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,920
I hope you did not try to put this 18:6

928
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,329
into practice at the end of your

929
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,070
flowering phase because that would have

930
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:20,299
caused you problems and then I would

931
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:23,569
have felt like a dick for messing up

932
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:25,460
your crop um let's talk about the only

933
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:28,189
reason that would be useful because this

934
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,650
is where I'm sure you got this idea

935
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,970
the only time they going to 18-6 at the

936
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,009
end of your flowering phase would be

937
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,319
useful is if you plan to revenge that

938
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:38,869
plan the only time that that's useful is

939
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,299
if you do not have a clone let's say you

940
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:42,949
got a clone from your friend you grew it

941
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,200
you thought your buddy had more clones

942
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,450
he doesn't that weed that you grew about

943
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,309
week six week seven you realized this is

944
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,500
the best [ __ ] weed I have ever grown

945
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,179
I want to grow this more there are no

946
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,660
clones there are no other options that's

947
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:59,390
the only plant of that strain left so

948
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,830
here's what you could do 14 days before

949
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,920
harvest you can turn your light timer

950
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:07,819
back to eighteen six or you can put it

951
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:10,400
on 24 hours that will make the plant

952
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:14,269
start thinking it's time to go back into

953
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,430
veg but that 14 days will not be enough

954
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:19,129
time for the plant to actually return to

955
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:23,210
veg if you cut it down as predicted in

956
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:25,940
14 days so you're gonna cut down most of

957
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,890
the plant and you will leave about four

958
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,630
maybe five or six shoots at the very

959
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,670
bottom of the plant just small little

960
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,550
buds with just just enough to keep the

961
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,490
plant alive and if you put that back

962
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:39,049
into the 24 or 18 six after you harvest

963
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,480
the rest of the plant the remaining

964
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:43,909
plant will eventually turn itself back

965
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,220
to veg and you were speeding it up and

966
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:49,430
buying yourself time by putting it under

967
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,380
the veg flowering cycle while you're in

968
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,450
flower that's just gonna save you time

969
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,430
to revert your plant also if you're

970
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,980
trying to revert it feed it a high

971
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,750
nitrogen diet and also add some sea kelp

972
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,089
to there there are tricks that you can

973
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,829
do with gibberellic acid I don't have

974
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:07,339
enough experience to talk about it on

975
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:09,500
here if you want to research Reve edging

976
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:11,629
your plant by using gibberellic acid it

977
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,289
is very possible I know somebody who

978
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:18,020
does it that information is very easily

979
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,339
available online I have not enough

980
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,559
experience with it to talk about it

981
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:23,329
myself but I encourage you to try it if

982
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,490
you don't have a clone of your favorite

983
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:28,490
plant you can revenge it but that's the

984
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,720
only time that I think of it increasing

985
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,490
your light cycle at the end of a

986
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,920
flowering phase would be useful so

987
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,779
please like I said earlier don't do that

988
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,160
to your normal flowering plants if

989
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:38,899
you're trying to speed them up if you're

990
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,880
trying to make them Hardy R if you're

991
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,880
trying to make things change reduce the

992
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,700
light because

993
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,340
these plants are photosensitive the

994
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,350
light does 90% of the [ __ ] to these

995
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:51,269
plants it gives it all the signals it

996
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:52,769
tells it what's going on so if you start

997
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:54,240
adding more it thinks the days are

998
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:56,279
getting longer which means it thinks it

999
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,750
needs to veg if you reduce time it

1000
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:00,480
thinks days are getting shorter which

1001
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,920
makes it think it needs to finish here's

1002
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,720
a tip that I gave somebody online just

1003
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,480
recently this tip was about a very

1004
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,398
specific strain there is a strain that

1005
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,039
goes around Colorado right now that

1006
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,138
produces very delicious oil the hash

1007
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,460
that comes from this plant is [ __ ]

1008
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,860
delicious the Terps that come out of

1009
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,530
this are amazing top-shelf Terps it's

1010
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,990
what everybody wants the flowers are

1011
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,970
ugly as [ __ ] this plant doesn't finish

1012
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:27,000
up it would take you could probably let

1013
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:29,069
this plant go 12 to 14 weeks and it

1014
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,480
would finish up nicely most people don't

1015
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,800
have that much time and they're

1016
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,378
impatient and they don't understand

1017
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,120
what's going on I had the opportunity to

1018
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:38,190
play with this plant several times in

1019
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,019
what I learned and this was just

1020
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,389
thinking and trying to figure out how to

1021
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:46,019
speed up the plant and thinking what I

1022
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:49,500
could do I simply reduce the time I go

1023
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:52,440
from 12 12 when I'm in flower about the

1024
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,878
end of week 7 or 8 I drop it from 12 12

1025
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,590
to 10 on and 14 off now I'm giving it 10

1026
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,179
hours of daylight and 14 hours of

1027
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,750
darkness it thinks the days are getting

1028
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:02,369
shorter

1029
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,769
I'll let it go for about a week like

1030
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,049
that then I'll take two more hours off

1031
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:09,509
now I'm only running that light for

1032
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,730
eight hours a day on and 16 hours a day

1033
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,710
off now this plant is thinking that

1034
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:17,099
winter is coming and it says what the

1035
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:19,800
[ __ ] am I gonna do I must reproduce so

1036
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,440
it starts making fatter and fatter buds

1037
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,330
the trichomes start riping up I make it

1038
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,309
a little colder in the room drop it just

1039
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,590
three or four more degrees get it nice

1040
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:30,779
and chilly in there at night those

1041
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,850
plants will finish up much more quickly

1042
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,560
you can cut 2 to 3 weeks off of these

1043
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:36,719
plants instead of 14 weeks you can

1044
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,250
finish these plants at 10 or 11 weeks

1045
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,709
I've cut them down at the end of week 10

1046
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,539
and I've considered them to be done but

1047
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,760
you've got to speed them up by reducing

1048
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,019
the timer late in Flour if you do it at

1049
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,030
week six you're kind of cutting yourself

1050
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,940
off of optimal growth if you do it week

1051
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,950
seven at the end of week seven you can

1052
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,349
really start speeding up the finishing

1053
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:56,669
time of longer flowering plants

1054
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,319
all right you guys I want to thank

1055
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,760
everybody for listening to this semi

1056
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,289
short episode I know I didn't talk a

1057
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,580
whole lot about cannabis and I did not

1058
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:04,320
give a whole lot of useful information

1059
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,869
but I hope you had fun hanging out with

1060
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,700
me anyway I had a long productive week I

1061
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:10,469
had a lot of fun I did not have as much

1062
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,750
time for the podcast as I would like to

1063
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:14,639
have had but I will bring you a better

1064
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,289
episode next week I need to get myself

1065
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,869
ready to go see the Grateful Dead

1066
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:20,219
tomorrow and Boulder it's not the

1067
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,559
Grateful Dead but it's close enough it's

1068
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:25,230
dead and Coe it is most of the remaining

1069
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,940
Grateful Dead members that are alive -

1070
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,250
Phil Lesh Phil's taking it easy he's

1071
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,869
staying in California he's the original

1072
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:34,139
bass player right now they've got Oteil

1073
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:36,690
Burbridge on bass and also they have got

1074
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,309
John Mayer on lead guitar if you haven't

1075
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,450
seen dead and Coe with John Mayer on

1076
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,889
guitar you're probably going what the

1077
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:43,169
[ __ ] John Mayer plays guitar for The

1078
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:44,579
Grateful Dead he does and at first I

1079
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,139
wanted to hate it when I heard about

1080
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,429
this years ago I was like they put bad

1081
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,379
dude on guitar with a Grateful Dead what

1082
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:51,690
are they doing then I went and saw it

1083
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,630
and I have no complaints I'm satisfied

1084
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,179
it's [ __ ] perfect I am amazed at how

1085
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,500
perfect it is he is one of us I've

1086
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,169
listened to him talk about it I've seen

1087
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,469
him play it no doubt in my mind John

1088
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,000
Mayer is one of us so big shout at John

1089
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,859
Mayer for making the dead and Coe

1090
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,750
magical I can't wait to go tomorrow

1091
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,980
shout to everybody that I got to dance

1092
