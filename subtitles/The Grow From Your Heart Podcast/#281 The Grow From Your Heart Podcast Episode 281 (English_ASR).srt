00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,718
podcast here I told you what I'm smoking

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,128
on what else do we want to talk about I

63
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,870
like to keep you guys updated on my

64
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,310
breeding projects of course I am

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,200
breeding some new seeds I've been

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,209
talking about it there is of course I

67
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,009
used in a rise mail and I put the pollen

68
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,120
on there are several girls in there but

69
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,429
the ones I've been talking a lot about

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,549
are the star dog and the Durbin poison

71
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,180
and the platinum tangi they are loaded

72
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,549
with seeds

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,260
they will be done in sometime around 10

74
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,968
to 15 days I keep checking on them

75
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,679
they're closed they're closed you guys

76
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:48,719
that I'd like to time seeds kind of

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,129
perfectly I know what I'm looking for

78
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,449
and they are almost there they're not

79
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,489
quite there yet but they're very close

80
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,128
to those that breeding project is almost

81
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,079
done I'll have star dog to arise I will

82
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,628
have Durbin poison to arise platinum

83
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,730
tangi to arise a couple other great

84
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:04,649
things in there I'm making more of old

85
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,658
things that I sell out of at the hella

86
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,280
dank seed bank so there'd be some

87
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:11,128
refreshers come in and some brand new

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,188
[ __ ] another thing I want to talk about

89
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:18,509
is since I'm talking about breeding this

90
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:20,430
year in 2018 I am going to remake the

91
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,530
lemon jeffrey feminized seeds which

92
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,530
means while I'm at it I will remake the

93
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,449
golden goat feminized seeds also a lot

94
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,310
of people think I created golden goat I

95
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,199
did not create golden goat I got golden

96
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,509
goat early on when it was really popular

97
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,030
in the Colorado dispensary run it went

98
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,918
around like wildfire everybody had it I

99
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,840
grabbed myself a clone of it I started

100
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,909
growing it I realized how much I loved

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,250
it I love the high I love the flavor I

102
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:45,658
love the effects I like growing it it's

103
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,699
a great plant to grow it gives me big

104
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,289
fat weight I started growing it a lot I

105
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,969
took some great photos of it the photos

106
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:52,888
got passed around and everybody saw them

107
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:55,169
on social media then I started breeding

108
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,819
to the golden goat and then I made

109
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,069
golden goat feminized seeds and put

110
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,128
those out available through an old

111
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,719
brittle old vendor and then everybody

112
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:05,938
thought I made it I did not make it a

113
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,650
guy by the name of mr. dink actually

114
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:09,120
made the golden goat I'm just known for

115
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,129
growing the [ __ ] out of it and I made

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,500
FEM seeds of it and passed them around I

117
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:15,959
did not create it so let me not take

118
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,329
credit for that I did make the lemon

119
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,000
Geoffrey I used the golden goat reversed

120
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,949
pollen and put that on the female lemon

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,228
skunk and that made lemon Geoffrey FEM

122
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,370
seeds that is when I did make so just

123
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,930
want to clear that up but I'm going to

124
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,788
make more golden goat see

125
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,509
and I'm going to make more lemon Jeffery

126
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:35,550
seeds probably there will be one run

127
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,860
between the breeding project that's

128
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,478
wrapping up and then there'll be a run

129
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,970
between that and then that's when I plan

130
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,478
on doing the golden coat lemon skunk

131
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,800
cross again so it'll be this year but it

132
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:48,209
will be quite a while there are other

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,770
projects in line I've got a schedule of

134
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,089
things that I want to do and I've got

135
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,500
things lined up the clones are already

136
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:54,119
cut the little baby plants are growing

137
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,709
shits in motion so you just have to keep

138
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,720
the wheels turning or things will fall

139
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:00,029
apart I can't rush things but it will

140
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,190
come everything will come in time

141
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,359
and lemon Jeffrey let me mention that if

142
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,610
you guys haven't heard about the lemon

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,979
Jeffrey that's a lemon skunk - golden

144
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,750
goat and it has made some pretty

145
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,079
impressive tests I've seen aa

146
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,329
very high 20s and low 30s consistently

147
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,918
from the lemon Jeffrey but my favorite

148
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:20,550
part is the concentrates that it makes

149
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,698
it makes live resin it tastes like lemon

150
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,139
candy and it is so delicious it's a it's

151
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,629
one of my favorite strains it's

152
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,978
certainly one of my top three most proud

153
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,478
strains that I've made somebody asked me

154
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,000
on instagram live what my proudest

155
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,219
strains are in no particular order or

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,050
rise grateful dog and lemon Jeffrey

157
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,580
would be my three favorites so the lemon

158
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,439
chef is up there and it's currently

159

unavailable in seed for him anywhere so

160
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,408
we're gonna fix that we're gonna get

161
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,239
some over at the hell a dank seed

162
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:47,038

00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:53,250
listener I really like reading emails

166
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,050

this problem a lot of people possibly

172

you home with some IRA genetics the

281
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,909
email goes on like this that says anyway

282
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:29,519
my question I am running either critical

283
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,740
or landish strain and then he says funny

284
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,079
story in parenthesis but he also says

285
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,690
full cocoa nutrient line PhD at five

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,000
point nine in cocoa DNA with cork in

287
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,210
seven gallon smart pots the lights are

288
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,100
to Mars hydro lights 140 watt lights one

289
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:50,160
Cree cxb 3590 at 58 watts and to no-name

290
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,769
[ __ ] full spectrum 50 watt cobs with

291
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,329
reflectors and lenses the kobzar

292
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,429
circuits on board is what I think that

293
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,340
stands for they also says I'm running a

294
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,899
little extra co2 than ambient so he just

295
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,250
described his he tells me he has a

296
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,110
question then he describes his setup

297
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,940
he's running he's not sure which strain

298
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,789
he's got it's either critical or landish

299
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,040
uh and he says funny story there which a

300
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:12,659
really easy story to imagine being a

301
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,549
very experienced grower who has worked

302
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,500
in several grows and worked with [ __ ]

303
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:18,809
helpers that have crossed labels and me

304
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,159
being too high on cross labels and which

305
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:21,929
seeds are these which clones are these

306
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,600
that stories not even funny I know how

307
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,509
that [ __ ] goes but he's got one or the

308
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,129
other he's running full cocoa the pH is

309
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,309
at five nine we're gonna talk about that

310
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,929
uh he's doing DNA with cork the cocoa

311
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,389
DNA with cork and seven gallon smart

312
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,620
pots all that makes sense so far then he

313
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,120
describes the lights there are a lot of

314
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,620
lights I don't know how far apart or how

315
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,330
close they are but so far it seems like

316
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,419
it should be cool and also he's

317
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,830
enriching a little extra co2 so now we

318
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,269
have a pretty good overview of what's

319
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,500
going on there in the room we know

320
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,750
what's in there and we know how much

321
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,399
lights in there so let's get to the

322
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,019
question he said I noticed just a few

323
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,939
days after switching to bloom all of my

324
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,980
fan leaves started turning yellow all

325
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,740
but the veins then would progressively

326
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,360
turn more yellow I'm thinking cal-mag

327
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,700
issue but the gross stored assured me

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,058
there was a ton of it in the newts and I

329
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,269
shouldn't need the supplement

330
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:12,308
he told me to up my ph to 6-3 2-6 4 and

331
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,058
it all should be well could it be

332
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:15,578
something else

333
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:18,158
any thoughts and then he says again man

334
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:19,928
thanks for responding it means a lot

335
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:21,548
hey man you're very welcome for the

336
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:24,218
response thanks for the great email I

337
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:25,718
need a drink and I need a DAB so I am

338
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:27,219
going to press pause for a second and

339
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,929
take a quick drink and moisten up my

340
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,939
throat and also take a DAB while I'm

341
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:33,458
there while I'm doing that I encourage

[Music]

355
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:18,149
all right podcast world I am back I am

356
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:20,548
well hydrated and heavily medicated I've

357
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,649
got some sour Joker high cannabinoid

358
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:24,418
full-spectrum extract it's the diamonds

359
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,458
it looks like little little crystals in

360
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,869
the jar here little chunks of ah just

361
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,018
THC madness

362
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:33,269
it's a 97% THC and then in the other

363
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,918
hand I have got some orange ghost batter

364
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,149
let's see if I can find the label for

365
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,708
the orange ghost batter it should be

366
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,869
right here I did not set that one aside

367
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,068
let's see it does not have the lab test

368
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:44,879
on that one I need the other one with

369
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:48,028
the lab test orange goes to batter 76%

370
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,009
THC so I take a little bit of the orange

371
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:51,479
ghost batter it's a little softer and

372
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,129
easier to work with I stick a little bit

373
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,538
about on the dabber and then I take some

374
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,699
of those high cannabinoid full-spectrum

375
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,828
extract crystals and stick those right

376
00:12:56,698 --> 00:13:01,558
inside of the batter and then I take a

377
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:03,358
big old fat dab of that it is it's a

378
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,889
cold night it's frosty cold in Colorado

379
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,309
but I am sweating here at the table

380
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,528
I am super medicated and super sweaty so

381
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:12,899
that was a highly effective dab shot us

382
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:15,479
at the crew at apothecary for reckon me

383
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,249
right now alright now let's get back on

384
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,839
track here our friend sent us an email

385
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:21,089
asking why his leaves were turning

386
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,819
yellow he also sent me a picture and

387
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,099
those leaves are very pale and yellow

388
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:29,958
they need some nutrients let's talk a

389
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:32,908
little bit about some things here I

390
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,408
think it's a nitrogen deficiency the

391
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:36,088
people at the growth snore don't seem to

392
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:37,678
think it's a Cal mag problem it could

393
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,749
have something to do with the cal mag

394
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:42,178
but it's more of a nitrogen deficiency I

395
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:43,859
feel like those leaves don't have any

396
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:45,658
green to them which is probably a

397
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:47,759
nitrogen problem from the picture you

398
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,609
sent me if you go to google and you

399
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,349
google cannabis leaf problems it'll

400
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:54,239
bring up a chart and if you look at that

401
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,129
chart there are a couple that will fool

402
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:58,470
you you'll want to think it's sulfur or

403
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:00,269
a zinc deficiency but the obvious one

404
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,399
that it looks like is a nitrogen

405
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,989
deficiency and when you said that it

406
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,568
Hart that started as soon as you switch

407
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:08,879
to flower that gives me another hint at

408
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:11,308
what could be going on here bloom

409
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,819
nutrients are very low in nitrogen your

410
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:17,458
plant takes up 85 to 90 percent of its

411
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:17,968
nitrogen during its vegetative stage of

412
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,248
its life

413
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,479
now you've switched a flower which tells

414
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,339
me you've probably switched to your

415
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,300
flower nutrients and if you read the

416
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,400
bottles

417
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,929
there is an NPK value printed on the

418
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,179
front of those bottles and the N stands

419
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,099
for nitrogen if you look at your your

420
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,199
base nutrient and you look at the

421
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,820
nitrogen level of your veg nutrient it

422
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,700
will be a much higher nutrient a

423
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,850
nitrogen value than on the flowering

424
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,050
nutrient that first number the N perhaps

425
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,600
and I'm just making up numbers here

426
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:48,120
it'll be seven on your veg nutrient and

427
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,830
it'll be 0.5 on your flowering nutrient

428
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,929
so you're dropping out the nitrogen as

429
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,000
soon as you switch to flower now that

430
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,979
may be okay but it looks like it's not

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,230
for your plants so I would mix in a

432
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,000
little bit of the veg nutrients with

433
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,440
your feed do 50 percent of the flowering

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,850
nutrient and fifty percent of the veg

435
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,950
nutrient and maybe that'll help you

436
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,690
you're gonna be chasing it you're never

437
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,790
going to catch up with that nitrogen

438
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,200
it's already so far ahead of you I don't

439
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,000
think you'll be able to catch up it's

440
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,830
far gone it needs some help it needs

441
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,509
some love I would consider foliar

442
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,490
feeding it with some base nutrients as

443
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,950
well I think the main problem is a

444
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,080
nitrogen deficiency I would foliar feed

445
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,000
it I would pull off a lot of the bottom

446
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,710
leaves and a lot of the lower [ __ ] just

447
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,230
so that the nutrients that it does get

448
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,910
can be moved around more useful if it

449
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,879
doesn't have 12 arms it can make two

450
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:34,740
arms stronger if that makes any sense

451
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:38,340
also I think part of the problem that

452
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,610
may cause your yellowing may be

453
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,500
low-light conditions I don't know enough

454
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,419
about the LEDs that you listed to have

455
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,669
any idea what you're talking about but

456
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,459
low light conditions could lead to what

457
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,899
you're talking about ah low nutrients

458
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,379
could lead to what you're talking about

459
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,209
you may need more nutrients overall also

460
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,220
you may be giving the plants too much

461
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,860
water they may be root bound they may be

462
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,860
drowning in there the pH could be off

463
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,779
you said the pH is at five point nine

464
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,330
the guys at the gross store are

465
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:12,059
completely correct you should go to six

466
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,160
three two six four six three two six

467
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,889
five somewhere in that range would be

468
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,809
better I would assume that if you lower

469
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,340
if you put the pH around six three and

470
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,899
started feeding with a little more

471
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,490
nitrogen you'll start seeing more

472
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,709
productivity from the plants they may

473
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,659
start green it up on you but you're

474
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,150
gonna be chasing it it's going to be a

475
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:33,259
battle the entire grow now another thing

476
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:36,360
I want to mention um you said you are

477
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,120
running a little extra co2 than ambient

478
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,980
now you're giving the plants

479
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,259
more co2 which means they're growing

480
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,200
more rapidly which means they are going

481
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:47,450
to want to eat more rapidly so if you're

482
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,220
gonna run co2 you're gonna have to use

483
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,890
more nutrients you're gonna have to dial

484
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,860
in the pH if you're growing in cocoa as

485
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:56,929
described I would recommend every time

486
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,300
you water that plant that it gets

487
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:01,489
nutrients in cocoa I never give the

488
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,740
plants plain water they always get

489
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,328
nutrients and they all I always pH so I

490
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,588
run a large commercial growing in each

491
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:11,990
in one room in the bedroom we can have

492
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:15,698
700 plants in veg at one time and I

493
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:19,130
water them every day i pH that water

494
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:21,829
26.3 and I put nutrients in the water

495
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,679
every single day and we're in 3 gallon

496
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:26,058
pots of cocoa with perlite in it so

497
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,660
that's what I'm doing in a large-scale

498
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:31,879
facility six point three and I feed

499
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,840
nutrients every time and I'm in cocoa so

500
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,429
that's what I would recommend for you

501
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,839
and it may help you out if you're

502
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,759
growing in cocoa and you're not feeding

503
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,139
it nutrients almost every watering

504
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,910
you're going to start to see

505
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,830
deficiencies because cocoa doesn't hang

506
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,029
on to anything it all just runs right

507
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,769
out of the bottom of the plant with the

508
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,928
water what the plant doesn't absorb it

509
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:50,089
doesn't hang out for too long so my

510
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,940
official diagnosis is that's a nitrogen

511
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:55,069
deficiency it you could adjust the pH

512
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,990
that may help it I would add nutrients

513
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:58,849
I would water with nutrients every time

514
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,500
you water that plant until you start

515
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:01,909
flushing it I would pull off the leaves

516
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,480
on the bottom and the [ __ ] leaves that

517
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,970
don't look good

518
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,349
any lower branches you don't need take

519
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,000
those off if there are branches that

520
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:09,919
have little tiny sucker branches coming

521
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,440
off clean that [ __ ] off there also

522
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,900
if you take off all the weak branches

523
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,058
all the strong branches will be stronger

524
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,860
it'll get more use of the nutrients I

525
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:20,839
would kind of clean up the bottom

526
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:23,539
lollipop a little extra take off the

527
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,459
bottom of the crap this the the fluffy

528
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:27,440
[ __ ] and just kind of focus more on just

529
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,120
a few tops pick a few winning branches

530
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,039
hopefully you can get six or eight

531
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,659
winning branches out of the tops and use

532
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,279
those as your main winners and take all

533
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,019
that bottom crap off so that way you

534
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,819
still have that big strong root ball and

535
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:39,500
it's able to cycle that much nutrients

536
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,789
but it's only got a feed like six tops

537
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,319
instead of a bunch of [ __ ] on the

538
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,879
bottom that may help you out get the

539
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,740
nutrients where you need them the foliar

540
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,570
feed could help you out you may be

541
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,190
watering too much as that plant sitting

542
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:51,230
on a cold floor that's something I just

543
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,778
thought of is it on the floor is that

544
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,028
floor getting

545
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:56,548
cold that maybe pissing your root ball

546
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:58,710
off that that may be a huge thing is

547
00:18:56,548 --> 00:19:00,148
that plant sitting on the cold floor and

548
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,729
any water it and it's sitting in a

549
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:05,308
saucer and then all of that water sits

550
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:07,319
in that saucer for however long and

551
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:10,469
those roots are just sitting there in

552
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,058
cold shitty water put your hand in cold

553
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:13,739
shitty water overnight put your toes in

554
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,418
cold shitty water overnight and see how

555
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:18,090
much you like that your leaves will turn

556
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,009
yellow also so those are all things that

557
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,658
I think may help you out those are oh

558
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,548
and also if you're running co2 you guys

559
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,070
if you are enriching co2 you are

560
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:27,898
encouraging that plant to grow faster

561
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,368
you were turning that plant from a

562
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:31,678
normal performer from a normal athlete

563
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,088
into an MMA fighter you are now giving

564
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,919
it steroids you have to feed it like

565
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:37,648
it's on steroids you can't just give it

566
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,149
a normal diet imagine right now if I

567
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,888
didn't give you any extra vitamins or

568
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:42,838
nutrients and I told you just go run up

569
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,178
hills until you pass out it's not gonna

570
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:46,888
take a long time if I give you more

571
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,749
nutrients and I give you a better meal

572
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:50,098
plan and I say now go run until you pass

573
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,960
out you're gonna be able to run a little

574
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:53,338
faster you got the proper nutrition the

575
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,259
plants need the proper nutrition when

576
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:57,148
you give them that co2 steroids so if

577
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,858
you're gonna enrich co2 and make them

578
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:01,918
stronger you have to make them stronger

579
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:03,598
all the way around also I should mention

580
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,409
here if you're gonna feed co2 at the

581
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:06,960
start of flower

582
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:08,879
you cannot stop feeding at co2 because

583
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,259
they're gonna start eating like they're

584
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,939
getting fed co2 they're gonna start

585
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,409
growing like they're getting fed co2 and

586
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,028
when you cut that out it's really gonna

587
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:16,200
confuse them and they're gonna start

588
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:18,538
having problems they're gonna start

589
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,190
growing odd instead of growing a big

590
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:22,378
long Cola they'll start doing these

591
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,729
little like a bud here a bud here a bud

592
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,138
here and it'll never fit all the way

593
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:27,179
together like a cola it'll just be a

594
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:28,858
bunch of little popcorn balls then

595
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,599
really [ __ ] up your harvest weight and

596
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:33,058
it's kind of a waste of co2 if you start

597
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:34,618
using it and then you stop so if you

598
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,509
can't afford to run co2 through the

599
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:39,269
whole flowering cycle I would recommend

600
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:41,969
don't start until week three or maybe

601
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,108
week four or maybe even not at all if

602
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:45,419
you're just running a home drill you can

603
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:47,308
pull pretty good harvest without co2 but

604
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,778
if you're gonna run it run it all the

605
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:51,329
way through that's my recommendation and

606
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:53,398
don't overdo it because you can overdo

607
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:55,138
with the co2 all right I feel like I

608
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,628
ranted and rambled for a really long

609
00:20:55,138 --> 00:21:00,118
time for one email um this guy did not

610
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:02,428
say if he wants me to use his name or

611
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,928
not and he's in prohibition land so I'm

612
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,100
just gonna be respectful and not even

613
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,929
say his name

614
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,788
but do you know who you are you've got

615
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:10,500
my respect thanks for the great email

616
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:12,179
try some of the corrections I

617
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,220
recommended if you'd like to or don't

618
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,600
but if you do some of them send me a

619
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,980
message and let me know what works for

620
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,909
you and let me know if you agree with I

621
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,529
with what I said

622
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,529
I'll just interact with me on this and

623
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,579
we'll keep the conversation going

624
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:25,139
alright if you guys want to email me if

625
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,879
you've got cannabis growing questions if

626
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,559
you've got something to say if you want

627
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
to ask me something send me an email

628
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,369
let's grow from your heart at

629
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,110
hotmail.com I would love to hear from

630
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,548
you alright you guys I've got it

631
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,558
something else I wanted to talk about

632
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:39,750
have you ever grown some really good

633
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,178
herb and then you dry it and cured it

634
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,589
and then Mike [ __ ] up and left it open

635
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,330
for too long and it got all dry and

636
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:46,829
crispy and you did not know what you

637
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:49,918
were gonna do with this dry and crispy

638
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:51,808
weed well you guys don't panic if Mike

639
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,970
leaves your giant Tupperware dish with

640
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:56,579
like four to six pounds worth of really

641
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,589
top shelf buds open for way too long

642
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,678
because I have learned a pretty good

643
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:04,199
trick that I feel works too remoisten

644
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,090
these buds I've seen people do a whole

645
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,679
bunch of dumb [ __ ] over the years and

646
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,569
when you think about remoisten buds a

647
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,490
lot of you experienced growers you

648
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,408
probably cringe a little bit but it's

649
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,788
Colorado and I'm just picking on Mike he

650
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,620
didn't leave things open for too long

651
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:17,970
he opened the container and in Colorado

652
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,798
you can have buds that are nice and

653
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,269
moist and you can open the container and

654
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,579
by the time you close it those buds are

655
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:25,769
too [ __ ] dry it's Colorado it's dry

656
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,079
here we've got a humidifier we've got a

657
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,429
dehumidifier they try to keep things in

658
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,168
with within a certain range but

659
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,200
sometimes [ __ ] gets out of hand

660
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,880
and some buds dry up now we have learned

661
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,090
a good way to remoisten these buds I've

662
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,030
seen people use the classic is to use

663
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:43,529
some fruit or something which that's

664
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,960
that's not a bad idea but then you put

665
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,639
that fruit flavor into the cannabis and

666
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,750
who wants to grow good cannabis and then

667
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,549
throw some fruit in there and make it

668
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,720
taste like that there are also other

669
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:53,759
things you're introducing to the

670
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,000
cannabis as you do that that may make it

671
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,859
a little funky I've seen people use

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,538
Bhavana packs or Boveda packs or humid a

673
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,459
packs however you want to say it the

674
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:04,710
little packet see you can order that add

675
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,110
moisture and add humidity to a container

676
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,880
I've seen people use those what I do not

677
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:10,918
like about those is they leave a funky

678
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,020
flavor they make your weed taste like

679
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,210
water they make your weed taste like the

680
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,099
way of over to pack smells I don't like

681
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,140
those

682
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:20,089
I guess sometimes it would be better to

683
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,160
smoke some moist weed that kind of

684
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:23,720
tasted like above the pack than to smoke

685
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,640
some dusty ass weed that you rolled into

686
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,829
a joint it all just falls apart but

687
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,350
either way he [ __ ] up and I found a

688
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:32,418
better way to fix it what Mike and I did

689
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,699
we use a Tupperware dish it's a

690
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,410
Rubbermaid bin it's the Rubbermaid bin

691
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,330
that's probably about the size of a

692
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,830
laundry bin like if you're gonna put

693
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,298
your dirty laundry in a thing and take

694
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,798
it to the laundry mat or down to the

695
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:44,389
laundry room it's like the size of that

696
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,650
laundry basket it's maybe a little bit

697
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,059
bigger than Apps you can fit a bunch of

698
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,610
clothes in it that's the one we use at

699
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:51,349
the commercial grow we cut down we take

700
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:52,939
all the leaves off of a plant we cut

701
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:55,459
down the whole plant we cut it into

702
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,840
small pieces it hangs sorry we skipped a

703
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,730
step here we cut down the plant it hangs

704
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,189
it dries we cut it into smaller pieces

705
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,159
and then we put it into these Rubbermaid

706
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,570
bins now that's when the problems start

707
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,340
happening sometimes those Rubbermaid

708
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,428
bins aren't completely sealed and they

709
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:13,399
get too dry I have learned that I can

710
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,200
take not even a handful just a few

711
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,759
leaves from a fresh plant I go to a

712
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,860
flowering room and just pull a few

713
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,599
leaves off of a fresh plant and throw

714
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:23,509
those leaves into that Rubbermaid bin

715
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:26,808
and close it up for for six maybe eight

716
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:29,000
hours and those fresh leaves contain so

717
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:31,099
much moisture that they remoisten your

718
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,569
cannabis buds and the best part is it

719
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,279
still tastes like cannabis cuz you're

720
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,649
putting a cannabis leaf in there the

721
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,690
Brix level is the same the aroma is the

722
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,970
same it's the same plant you're just

723
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,970
spreading the same moisture around and I

724
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,288
approve it works very well I thought it

725
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,470
would be cute put like a handful of

726
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:52,579
leaves in there way too much of those

727
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:55,220
laundry basket sized Rubbermaid bins I

728
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:57,649
think four to five maybe six or eight

729
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,169
leaves is plenty to put in there to

730
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,059
remoisten some pretty dry buds so if

731
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:03,740
you've got a jar of weed that went to

732
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:06,079
dry maybe a couple of little leaves

733
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,779
maybe one decent-sized leave in your jar

734
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,879
would be enough to remoisten your dried

735
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:13,009
buds so that's a trick quit using wet

736
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,350
paper quit using a q-tip with water in

737
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:17,929
it quit using a cotton ball ah if you're

738
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:20,480
gonna do something if you can use a

739
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:22,610
fresh leaf cut a leaf off put it right

740
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,990
into the jar seal the jar up pay

741
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:25,459
attention to it don't let it get too wet

742
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,679
in there but it starts getting moist

743
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,700
take that leaf out leave it open long

744
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,250
enough for it to get right to the

745
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,410
perfect

746
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,759
- and seal that [ __ ] back up then keep

747
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,560
checking on it make sure you didn't over

748
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,210
moisten it as the moisture is inside

749
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,159
also the moisture is gonna work its way

750
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,890
out so if you've got some dry and crispy

751
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,370
buds maybe that's a way you can return

752
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,509
them to the proper moisture level all

753
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:47,189
