don't really pertain I've already read

101
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,200
the question a lot of these details

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
don't pertain so I'm going to skip some

103
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,518
of this we're going to get right to the

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,959
technical part of this question uh it

105
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,120
says rust to Jeff let me start out by

106
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,378
saying I'm a big fan of the show I've

107
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,180
been listening since right before the

108
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:53,098
vid bro thank you for jumping on I got a

109
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,599
lot of new uh listeners and subscribers

110
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,219
right around the vid time by the way if

111
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,658
you haven't already subscribed do hit

112
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,098
that subscribe button everybody out

113
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,019
there there's a lot more to this but

114
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,000
then it goes on it says I'm a big fan of

115
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,640
your gear ran a few strains and already

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,340
I have more in the dirt it says my

117
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,500
problem is that my overall dried and

118
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,239
trimmed weight is not to my satisfaction

119
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,818
so he's grown a bunch of great genetics

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,620
but the overall finished product doesn't

121
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,779
weigh enough we're not getting enough

122
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,519
finished product here at the end we do

123
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,939
have more details here the message goes

124
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,819
on it says in veg I have a 600 B spec

125
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,399
and a 150r spec covering about 40

126
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,740
seedlings and 30 veg in three gallon

127
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:35,039
homes and one of the flower rooms I have

128
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,060
a 40 I have 48 3 gallon plants under two

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,919
600 Aura specs and one 350 R-Spec Diablo

130
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,079
which are all hlg those are good lights

131
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,579
but that's a lot of plants bro uh and

132
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,139
the other flower room okay then he

133
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,579
describes the other room he says I'm

134
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,660
using New Millennium nutrients that

135
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,719
should work well for you at the

136
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,580
recommended dosage along with h g root

137
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,860
accelerator and epsom salt at a low

138
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,620
dosage it goes on and says I don't test

139
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,840
my PPM I also just put four weeks but I

140
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,280
have everything from seedlings to plants

141
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,560
to week nine a flower and everything

142
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,559
between uh he says I am supplementing

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,300
CO2 and he says anyway I never did a

144
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,579
true Fino hunt and my plants dried and

145
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,620
trim weight goes from 16 grams of plant

146
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,758
to 38 grams of plant I've seen there are

147
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,740
a lot of plants in this room I've seen

148
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,780
pictures there are a lot in there this

149
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,579
is my overall yield is less than half a

150
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,038
less than a pound and a half I have lost

151
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,538
track with with the plants so he says

152
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,000
I've lost track with the plants that are

153
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,860
in veg when they flower I can tell

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
anyway should I start tracking in veg

155
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,819
when I clone and then next Harvest this

156
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
is kind of worded a little bit oddly and

157
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm reading it very quickly says I need

158
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,918
weight to cover the cost and so forth or

159
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,080
is there something I'm missing or

160
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,359
messing up or any other suggestions

161
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,219
please feel free to read this for a show

162
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,479
I also worked okay so there's a lot of

163
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,419
details that I'm going to skip in here

164
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,699
in this question but there's also a lot

165
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,799
of stuff that I can explain very quickly

166
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,180
just from the little bit that I read my

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,340
friend sent a lot of pictures here of

168
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,800
this grow the first thing that I noticed

169
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,478
is that there are in my opinion I'm not

170
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,819
sure if you're going to disagree but in

171
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,219
my opinion there are just too many damn

172
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,139
plants in this room uh you're trying

173
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,759
you're kind of with all due respect and

174
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,038
I understand this because I'm guilty as

175
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,419
well you're being a plant hoarder you've

176
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,219
got too many different strains in there

177
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,740
in my opinion you got too many different

178
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,120
plants and really from reading what

179
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,038
you're telling me in this one paragraph

180
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
you don't have a strategy so if you

181
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,339
don't have a strategy if you don't have

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,139
a road map it's hard to get to the

183
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,060
destination it's hard to get to the goal

184
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,280
so the first thing I would do

185
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,899
I would minimize some of those plants in

186
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,939
every room there are too many plants in

187
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,859
every room I got a lot of photos every

188
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,779
room the plants are way too close

189
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,879
together that's why they look so tall

190
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,138
and stretchy and they're kind of there's

191
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,639
not a lot of growth at the bottom part

192
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,840
and they've really stretched out and I

193
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,519
know that you've cleaned up the bottoms

194
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,019
in a lot of those photos but they

195
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,459
wouldn't be so tall and stretchy if you

196
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,099
spread them out a little bit they're too

197
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,779
close together and instead of getting

198
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,340
tight nodes and developing the way they

199
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,478
should they're stretching to get up to

200
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,219
the light because there's just so many

201
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,839
of them crowded together instead of

202
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,039
being able to reach out and go ah yeah

203
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,719
I'm living the dream they're going hey

204
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,860
is there some [ __ ] light up there and

205
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,060
they're just trying to reach up as hard

206
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,860
as they can because they're frustrated

207
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,300
with life that's what it looks like to

208
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,220
me from the photos and that's simply

209
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,960
because you're just packing too many in

210
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,280
there and I know it sounds like a

211
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,719
numbers game you would think the more

212
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,758
plants in there the more product I'm

213
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,319
going to produce but there is a point of

214
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,538
diminishing returns and you've hit that

215
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
point my friend I would remove at least

216
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,959
one row along the outside one row along

217
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,879
the outside and the whole Square you've

218
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,620
got and just use all that space to

219
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,939
spread them out that much more I would

220
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,860
minimize a lot of plants in that room to

221
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,478
be be honest with you so there are too

222
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,979
many plants that are stretching and

223
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,478
they're competing for space because the

224
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,740
lower leaves are not getting any light

225
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,300
that's why you've had to clean up all

226
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,978
the bottoms and that's going to keep

227
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,379
happening as tall as they get the more

228
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,758
tall the taller they grow they're just

229
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,719
going to keep shading each other out and

230
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,699
they're just going to keep stretching

231
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,440
more to get taller and taller and tall

232
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,879
plants are great but you want plants

233
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,680
that fill in and produce a lot and they

234
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,478
don't have that option so you're not

235
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,740
setting yourself up for Success from the

236
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,839
beginning at the veg stage you're

237
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,340
already getting behind the plants are

238
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,439
already getting stretchy you need a good

239
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,359
foundation a good structure to have a

240
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,800
good weight producing plant so first

241
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,598
thing I would do I keep saying this too

242
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,819
many damn plants in all of those rooms

243
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,199
bro I know you got a lot of plants in

244
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,180
there you're just like me I'm a seed

245
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,379
hoarder I'm a plant hoarder I try to

246
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,939
grow as many as will fit in the damn

247
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,620
room that I am legally allowed but I

248
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,959
stuff the room dude

249
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,579
um so I get it but you've got to get rid

250
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,978
of some of those plants also they're too

251
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,478
close together spread them out also one

252
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,699
thing I noticed in your pictures there

253
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,860
are no fans there's no air movement in

254
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,419
any of those rooms which is also why the

255
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,038
plants are getting tall and stretchy and

256
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,139
spindly if you put some air in there

257
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,819
some air movement blow the plants around

258
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,379
they'll get a little stronger they won't

259
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,000
be so thin and wispy they'll get a

260
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,740
little bit thicker that will produce

261
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,139
bigger fatter buds a better Harvest a

262
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,658
better yield in the long run

263
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,158
um also they're not popped and twisted

264
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,659
nothing's really done to them they're

265
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,220
topped one time it looks like they

266
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,778
spread out and then you defoliate and

267
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,399
clean up the bottom shave the legs a

268
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,439
little bit but there's no popping and

269
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,539
twisting done if you spread them out a

270
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,100
little bit top them pop them and twist

271
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,838
them and put some fans on them that's

272
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,940
going to give you bigger beefier

273
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,500
stockier more robust plants you'll be

274
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,779
able to veg for a little bit less time

275
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,360
you'll still get big fat plants and you

276
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,860
won't need as many in the room so work a

277
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,620
little bit on the popping and twisting

278
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,259
uh I saw that I saw that the one room in

279
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,299
veg was heavily defoliated I probably

280
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,100
wouldn't defoliate that that much in veg

281
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,199
that is where you're getting the energy

282
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,180
I would wait a little bit more until the

283
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
flowering phase early flower mid flower

284
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,179
to do that default that heavy

285
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,679
defoliation that you're doing you can

286
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,958
still pull leaves but you're going kind

287
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,059
of hard in the beginning in my opinion

288
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,199
based on the photos so you got too many

289
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,299
plants in there they're too close

290
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,860
together there are no fans I'd spread

291
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,019
those [ __ ] apart get some wind on

292
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,580
them pop them and twist them I'm sure

293
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,560
you've heard the episode about popping

294
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,879
and twisting where you just uh I'll show

295
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,379
you kind of with this microphone a

296
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,759
little bit if this were the main stock

297
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,439
of the plant I would start at the bottom

298
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,299
right where it comes out of the dirt I

299
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,160
would grab it remember in school and we

300
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,500
tried to pick who goes first at baseball

301
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,639
who bats first uh you grab it down here

302
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,720
and then you put the other hand up here

303
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,819
and the other guy goes like this and

304
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,620
like this every time you do that just

305
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,240
twist opposite directions and pop the

306
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,500
cellulose structure of that plant it'll

307
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,659
sound like this

308
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,458
I don't know if that worked it'll sound

309
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,659
like that sound just like I'm popping a

310
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,819
knuckle that's what we call it on the

311
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:10,500
plants pop the knuckles what happens is

312
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
that will slow down that vertical growth

313
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
vertical right yeah slow down the

314
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,060
vertical growth of the plant it'll also

315
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,159
make the branch get a little bit more

316
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,139
robust and a little bit sturdier that

317
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,819
more robust sturdier thicker plant is

318
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,919
going to produce bigger fatter juicier

319
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,600
buds so it's going to make your stocks a

320
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,458
little stronger that's one thing that I

321
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,860
would definitely recommend less

322
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,778
defoliation and more fans is how I would

323
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,180
start then then something I want to talk

324
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,799
about is you said that you're using

325
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,719
um the new millennium nutrients with a

326
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,879
couple of additives are you using any

327
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,680
Bloom boosters in my opinion the New

328
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,778
Millennium is great but I like to add

329
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,979
something for a bloom booster if you

330
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,019
want to use something that is very

331
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,180
affordable and very effective in my

332
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,278
opinion I think that bud swell works

333
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,439
very well with the New Millennium mix

334
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,899
add some bud swell in there add that

335
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,180
around week five week six also I really

336
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,399
like a product called shine I talk a lot

337
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,078
about shine if I'm growing smokable

338
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,299
flour a lot of what I grow is for seed

339
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,278
if I'm I'm growing smokeable flour I put

340
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,838
a lot of shine in the mix I really think

341
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,578
that puts bulk in there it puts weight

342
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,620
to the product and it puts a lot of

343
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,379
trichomes and a lot of funk to your

344
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,720
product so the bud swell and some shine

345
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,519
and then a kelp product with that and

346
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,440
then also don't forget about the the

347
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,000
Ruby New Millennium doesn't sponsor me

348
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,820
or pay me but I think Ruby's a great

349
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,159
product it's fulvic acid use that five

350
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,180
milliliters per gallon with every feed I

351
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,278
think that'll make your feed more

352
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,899
effective so a bloom booster do you have

353
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,220
some sort of a balloon booster in there

354
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,799
something to push it something to make

355
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,360
it go she bang you've got all the uh all

356
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,740
the gas in there do you have anything to

357
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,000
make it turbocharged we got a

358
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,220
turbocharged this [ __ ] if you're not

359
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,379
getting enough we got a turbo charge it

360
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,940
the flower that you posted a picture of

361
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,278
looks good you posted some very

362
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,079
beautiful very colorful flower that

363
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,000
looks really good it looked healthy it

364
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,979
looked happy so I'm thinking we may need

365
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,259
just to boost these up a little bit the

366
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,420
topping looks good I would work on some

367
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,159
sort of scrogging or some sort of

368
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,078
trellis system or maybe some sort of

369
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,338
supports I would have less plants in

370
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,259
there and I would spread them out that

371
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,420
would make the plants get bigger they

372
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,458
would get beefy fat buds which are going

373
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,958
to need support so I would work on some

374
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,359
sort of a scrog net or some sort of

375
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,679
trellis or maybe tomato cages or maybe

376
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,600
just a bunch of sticks in there if you

377
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,159
do that be very careful but I would

378
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,899
recommend something to support them that

379
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,519
way they don't have to spend all of

380
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,958
their energy holding themselves up and

381
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,539
they can use more energy producing

382
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,458
flowers

383
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:28,259
also strain selection you said that you

384
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,679
haven't done any pheno hunts I think

385
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,879
strain selection is going to be a big

386
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,259
deal for you it's going to make a big

387
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,639
difference if you've got plants in there

388
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,980
that are not putting the weight you need

389
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,360
definitely remove those plants if you've

390
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,700
got plants in there that bang out the

391
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,079
weight you need put more of those plants

392
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,879
in the room that's kind of a no-brainer

393
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,379
there but that comes from a good Fino

394
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,778
hunt that comes from running [ __ ] that

395
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,458
also comes from not getting too attached

396
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,320
to those plants that are not performing

397
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,119
well they may be your friends they may

398
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,040
be green they may be beautiful but

399
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,179
sometimes we've got to call those plants

400
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,039
don't be afraid if you're trying to hit

401
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,419
numbers and pay the bills you can't get

402
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,860
too attached to things you've got to

403
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,019
remember that you've got to pay pay the

404
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,060
bills get rid of those low yielding low

405
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,500
quality plants that do not produce that

406
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,739
don't reach your goal set yourself up

407
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,419
for success bro so strain selection less

408
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,940
strains in there also less strains

409
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,639
overall and then I would dial it down to

410
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,560
like maybe two maybe three strains per

411
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,539
flower room that way you could learn the

412
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,859
strains if you've got too many plants in

413
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,599
that room how are you going to know that

414
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,399
this plant likes a little bit more

415
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,320
nitrogen and this plant doesn't like so

416
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,179
much Cal Mag and this plant would like

417
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,379
it a little bit cooler you'll never find

418
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,179
that out because you've got to run that

419
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,100
Baseline room all the time with no

420
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,078
adjustments no changes so I would

421
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,000
eliminate it to your few favorite plants

422
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,099
and then really build a relationship and

423
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,899
dial it in with a few cultivars in that

424
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,399
room that can definitely max out and

425
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,720
reach the potential and reach the goals

426
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,700
which you need to reach you've got too

427
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,959
many uh you're dating too many ladies in

428
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,940
there you're never going to learn one of

429
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,379
them to make one of them fully satisfied

430
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,180
you're going to be juggling to keep all

431
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,338
those ladies happy you just got to focus

432
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,799
on one and make that one lady super

433
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,839
happy and you will both win together so

434
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,759
one of my pieces of advice is to just

435
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,680
minimize is the amount of plants and the

436
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,600
variety in there and dial it in build a

437
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,419
relationship with a cut learn that cut

438
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,579
and maximize the [ __ ] out of that

439
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,838
um CO2 may help you said you have CO2 in

440
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,819
the room I don't know how much CO2

441
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,980
you're using but bang that [ __ ] out bro

442
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,720
turn it up get more of that

443
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,480
um then here's something that I really

444
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,100
think will help you a lot I think that a

445
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,320
little bit of a strategy a little bit of

446
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,300
a plan a little bit of a schedule a

447
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,740
little bit of a goal a little bit of a

448
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,939
standard operating procedure would

449
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,039
really help you out it kind of sounds

450
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,420
like you're you're growing you're making

451
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,059
flowers you're making product but you're

452
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,919
doing it kind of willy-nilly I would uh

453
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,138
write down when I picked these clones

454
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,639
I'm going to veg them is they're going

455
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,198
to be in the Clone stage for two weeks

456
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,899
I'll put them into small pots for three

457
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,578
weeks into bigger pots let them veg for

458
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,159
four weeks after that then we flour them

459
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,838
for nine weeks set a timeline decide how

460
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,480
tall in the veg you're gonna let those

461
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,699
plants get start setting some goals then

462
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,440
definitely start writing down when you

463
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:00,899
put when you cut the Clone when you put

464
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,760
it into veg when you put it into flour

465
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,198
start writing down what you feed how

466
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,078
often you feed it

467
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,698
create repeatables results by creating a

468
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,379
standard operating procedure and by

469
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:11,639
keeping notes and then keep the notes of

470
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,559
what you did

471
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,899
see what came out good see what came out

472
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,239
bad and then repeat what was good don't

473
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,159
do what was bad it looks like you've got

474
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,079
the right idea as a grower it definitely

475
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,639
looks like you know how to take care of

476
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,919
plants how to transplant things how to

477
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,600
build a room uh it looks like you have a

478
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,519
good understanding but I think you need

479
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
uh just a little bit of like a drill

480
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,698
sergeant and they're just saying what

481
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,379
did you do in here a soldier like write

482
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,479
this [ __ ] down Soldier get on a schedule

483
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,559
Soldier clean this [ __ ] up get rid of

484
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,879
these plants like you just need that

485
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,619
person over your shoulder and make that

486
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,820
person to you you're the only one in

487
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,980
there so you've got to be accountable

488
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,139
for that sort of stuff uh get on a

489
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,420
schedule I keep saying this but uh I'm

490
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,039
really OCD about I know I've got clones

491
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,599
in a cloner right now I've got small

492
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,278
pots somewhere right now I've got bigger

493
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
pots somewhere right now I've got a

494
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,299
pollinated room right now if I open up

495
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,099
my notebook in those rooms I know when

496
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,899
each thing happened in that room I know

497
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,000
what the last feed was in each of those

498
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,799
rooms I know what's going on I know when

499
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,659
the harvests are going to happen uh

500
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,179
knowing when the next Harvest is going

501
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:12,179
to happen allows me to know when to cut

502
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,039
clones for the Harvest to cut behind

503
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,739
that because I've got the Harvest coming

504
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,539
I've got veg plants going and as soon as

505
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,639
the Harvest comes down the veg plants go

506
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,860
into flour I've got to get Cuts so that

507
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,259
I've got those veg plants ready to go

508
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,820
once again so I've got a good tight

509
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,198
schedule written down I know exactly

510
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,360
when that [ __ ] needs to happen it's

511
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,639
basically when these clones go into

512
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,139
these pots these cups go into these pots

513
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,639
and they're going to veg but then the

514
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,500
first the old pots that were in there

515
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,419
going because I do it in two stages it

516
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,039
you'll learn your Rhythm So eventually

517
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,139
you'll be able to create a Perpetual

518
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,899
cycle you've got two rooms you should

519
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,339
have mother plants clones small veg and

520
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,379
then you should have veg lined up to go

521
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,759
into each flower room or at least a veg

522
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,379
in that room for a couple of weeks

523
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,120
you'll be able to create a great Rhythm

524
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,220
if you just plan a strategy and know

525
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,379
these plants flower for nine weeks that

526
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,180
means that every nine weeks I need to

527
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,519
have more plants ready to go into this

528
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,678
room figure out how long to veg when to

529
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,019
cut the plants that's a two-week clone

530
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,579
cycle you got seven more weeks to go you

531
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,959
got three weeks in a small pot four

532
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,480
weeks in a big pot then you go into

533
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,039
flour repeat that process dial it in

534
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,720
learn the plants learn the process learn

535
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,639
the Rhythm you will start banging out

536
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,179
the weight that you need so my friend

537
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,980
the overall diagnosis the prognosis my

538
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,600
my assumption in there is I think you're

539
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,699
just packing way too many plants in that

540
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,039
room and like I said it sounds like more

541
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,960
plants equals more weight but it doesn't

542
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,700
always equal more weight it equals more

543
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,140
fluffy Bud because all of the plants are

544
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,179
competing for that light that's in the

545
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,559
room it's like trying to feed a bunch of

546
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,600
people you could feed a hundred people

547
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,678
the same amount of food every day and

548
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,058
you're gonna have a bunch of skinny

549
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,280
people walking around if you cut it down

550
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,480
to 70 people those people get that much

551
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,160
more food they're going to get a little

552
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,660
bit thicker you start unfortunately we

553
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,980
can't just go cut out people but you see

554
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,080
what I'm saying if you cut it down to 50

555
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,460
percent of the people they get fed twice

556
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,500
as much they'll be able to thrive get

557
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,880
bigger build some muscle kick some ass

558
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,220
that's kind of what I'm recommending

559
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
happens in this grow also take those

560
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,000
[ __ ] notes uh definitely get a

561
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,340
schedule take some notes and get some

562
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,140
strategy going bro get a notebook get a

563
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:08,939
calendar we've all got Google devices

564
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,320
there are apps that'll take notes for

565
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,000

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,220
a full episode on how to set up some

569
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,500
schedules and take some notes and then

570
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,500
also add those Bloom boosters that bud

571
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,720
swell uh the shine some kelp products

572
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,700
and definitely use that fulvic acid if

573
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,140
you are not all right my dude I rambled

574
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,640
on quite a while how long have we been

575
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,200
