9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,939
the potency label says this contains

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,100
sixty four point four percent THC and

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,558
seventy four percent total cannabinoids

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,500
my favorite part about the Lemon G is

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,988
the disgustingly delicious flavor and

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,090
aroma it's gross and delicious all at

15
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,699
the same time it is like lemon G with

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,520
armpits and onions on top of it and for

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,109
some reason I really enjoy it so that's

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,149
what I'm dabbing on today I'm smoking

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,039
the lemon G ambrosia from apothecary

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,660
farms it's got a really nice buzz to it

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,439
it's got me nice and talkative it's got

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,538
me really chatty

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,628
it's got my brain and a nice flow so

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,368
this should be a great podcast this

25
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,709
episode is going to be all about what I

26
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,150
call the Colorado crunch let's jump

27
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,188
right into it what the hell is the

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,380
Colorado crunch what am I talking about

29
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,750
if you come to Colorado and you shop in

30
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,879
a Colorado dispensary most of the time

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,060
you are going to be served what is known

32
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,310
as the Colorado crunch in the cannabis

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,228
community around the nation Colorado is

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,439
laughed at because most of our product

35
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,819
is way too dry being in the environment

36
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,828
in which we are in that is hard to

37
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,908
prevent we're at a very high altitude it

38
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,349
is very dry here

39
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,990
there's not a lot of moisture in the air

40
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,149
so of course all of the buds that are in

41
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,938
that environment are going to become dry

42
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,280
and crispy we know that it's happening

43
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,289
we understand being a commercial

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,719
cultivator and somebody who takes pride

45
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,820
in my work and takes pride in my final

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,009
product and wants to deliver the highest

47
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,529
quality product to the table I do

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,930
understand that the Colorado crunch can

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,820
be an issue for a consumer I also

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,979
understand how and why it's happening

51
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,739
and I see the chain of command that is

52
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,658
creating this Colorado crunch so let's

53
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,780
talk about the Colorado crunch what is

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,430
the Colorado crunch Colorado crunch is

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,650
what I call it when you come to Colorado

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,360
and you shop at one of our dispensaries

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,129
and you buy your product and you go

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,629
somewhere safe and you attempt to smoke

59
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:20,579
that product but when you put it in the

60
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:22,348
grinder and you go to grind it instead

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,659
of grinding it into a nice rollable

62
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:27,929
consistency it basically just turns into

63
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:31,048
a dry crispy crunchy powder that's what

64
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,879
I call the Colorado crunch in an ideal

65
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,620
environment that herb would be a little

66
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,090
bit sticky it would have a little bit of

67
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,590
moisture to it and when you put it in

68
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,598
the grinder it would feel a little bit

69
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,158
sticky as you twist it when you take

70
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,509
that material out of the grinder it

71
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,340
would stick to your fingers just a

72
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,780
little bit and then as you roll it it

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,250
would have a little bit of fluff to it

74
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,400
and then when you went to smoke it it

75
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,289
would have a nice delicious smooth full

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,230
flavor to it it tasted like a freshly

77
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:58,289
rolled joint unfortunately a lot of what

78
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,979
is sold to customers in Colorado is way

79
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:04,469
too dry to be impressive and again once

80
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,389
your herb gets that dry it grinds up

81
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:08,818
like [ __ ] it burns up when you try to

82
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,649
smoke it and also it doesn't taste very

83
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:13,199
good you have dried out all of the turps

84
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,579
all the flavor is gone and now instead

85
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,649
of smoking what could have been

86
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,450
connoisseur quality product you're now

87
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,000
just smoking you know like a seven out

88
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,280
of a ten now being the lead cultivator I

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,489
would like to deliver a 10 to the Shelf

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,979
I'm not satisfied with putting 70% of my

91
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,829
quality out there I want 100% of the

92
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,138
quality my name my face and my

93
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,480
reputation are on the line when it comes

94
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,909
to that product a lot of people know

95
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,828
which grows and which dispensaries I am

96
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,900
affiliated with and they will shop at

97
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,510
those stores just because they know I

98
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,609
grew that product so it's embarrassing

99
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,198
to me to know that we're putting out 70%

100
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,290
of what we could be doing

101
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,530
I would like to deliver a 100% top-shelf

102
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,000
quality product to the consumers so now

103
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,068
I want to talk a little bit about what

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,870
happens to the product from the time it

105
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,539
leaves the commercial cultivation

106
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,239
facility to the time it finally reaches

107
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,729
the end consumer in most large

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,009
commercial cultivation facilities there

109
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,709
is a person in charge of drying and

110
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,108
curing the finished product it is that

111
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,910
person's duty to make sure that product

112
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,370
is dried and cured properly and that it

113
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,260
never becomes too dry on the other side

114
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,329
of that token part of their job is also

115
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,218
to make sure that herb doesn't stay wet

116
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,500
too long and stay sealed in a container

117
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,050
too

118
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,209
and become moldy or funky and ruin the

119
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,490
aroma and flavor so they have a lot of

120
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:36,279
responsibilities one of their big

121
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,069
responsibilities is to maintain correct

122
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,649
moisture of finished product in the

123
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,509
facilities which I operate we do that by

124
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,759
keeping a dehumidifier running

125
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,099
constantly and a humidifier running

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,289
constantly and we set them both at 50%

127
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,840
and we seal a room and we let them

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,050
battle it out at all times so that room

129
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,269
is constantly at 50% humidity which

130
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,460
keeps our buds at a perfect moisture

131
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,019
level now depending on how much product

132
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,549
there is the buds will be kept in

133
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,339
different sized containers when there is

134
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,439
a lot we use very large like Rubbermaid

135
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,729
storage containers once we get down to

136
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,800
smaller batches we use smaller

137
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,689
containers once we get down to the pound

138
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,910
level we start using turkey bags

139
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,009
actually and we seal the turkey bags up

140
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,439
and those turkey bags and all of those

141
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,779
packages are still kept in that room

142
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,319
which is maintained at 50% relative

143
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,869
humidity at all times so while any flour

144
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,269
is in my possession in any facility in

145
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,790
which I am responsible for we are very

146
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:36,039
careful to maintain the correct humidity

147
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,890
and moisture levels of our flowers at

148
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,900
all times now a lot of people may say

149
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,180
that herb is going to sit there in that

150
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:45,069
dry and cure room for a long time and

151
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,009
it's just gonna get funky waiting but

152
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,379
that is inaccurate at this point in time

153
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,579
cannabis is in high demand

154
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,519
recreationally and medically there's a

155
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:56,889
high demand for quality flowers as soon

156
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,930
as I determine the flowers are ready for

157
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,418
the Shelf the store will take it they

158
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,459
want that delivery immediately so the

159
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:05,829
flower is not sitting around at all

160
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,930
first off we don't have any space to

161
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,699
store bulk flower in most commercial

162
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,100
facilities we just need it out of there

163
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,228
second of all it's in high demand there

164
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,570
is no back stock at the store they need

165
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:18,789
to get that product from us to the store

166
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,009
on the shelf to the consumer in a pipe

167
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,419
and keep the cycle moving so there is no

168
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,699
back stock it's not sitting around

169
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:26,620
getting dry there's no opportunity for

170
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,478
that as soon as we harvest a crop it is

171
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,910
basically sold and then all of the trim

172
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,560
material is immediately sent off to a

173
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,960
concentrate company to be turned into

174
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,538
concentrates we don't sit on anything we

175
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
need quick returns in this industry so

176
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:40,329
why is the bud crunchy we still haven't

177
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,459
gotten to that part

178
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,199
at some point this product has to leave

179
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,269
my custody it has got to leave the

180
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,069
commercial cultivation facility where it

181
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:50,438
is kept in that controlled environment

182
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,629
at all times it is transferred to the

183
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,780
retail location and that is where I feel

184
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,550
the problem begins most of the time the

185
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,959
dispensary will place an order from the

186
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,310
commercial grow they'll say hey we see

187
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,658
you've got this in stock on your

188
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,848
spreadsheet because I keep a spreadsheet

189
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:06,430
of my entire inventory and they'll say

190
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:08,050
hey we need this much we'll say gold and

191
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,759
go for this conversation we're gonna say

192
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,319
they just ordered two pounds of gold and

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,000
goats send us two pounds of gold and go

194
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,319
with the next order there's gonna be

195
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,579
more stuff in that order but we're gonna

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,009
stick with the gold and go for this

197
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,228
conversation so at this point the person

198
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,030
in charge of the product in our facility

199
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,529
will weigh two pounds of gold and go

200
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,508
they'll package it up they'll give it a

201
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,829
package number it'll be all marked it'll

202
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,509
be all sealed up it'll be ready to go

203
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,968
that will go with the delivery so that

204
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,400
gets taken to the store now it is at a

205
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:34,778
store without a controlled environment

206
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,878
you were just in the store environment

207
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:40,449
it's probably whatever it is in the room

208
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,580
77 78 degrees whatever ambient humidity

209
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,439
you've got in that dispensary that's

210
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,508
what it is that's where that product is

211
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,939
now stored it is probably in a back

212
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,250
stockroom just chilling out on a shelf

213
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,658
who knows if the bud tender or whoever

214
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,968
is responsible for the product there

215
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:56,620
knows that they need to reseal that bag

216
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,569
when they're done pulling out whatever

217
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,250
they need who knows where it is stored

218
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,870
is it sitting right by the heater is it

219
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,449
sitting right by the air conditioner I

220
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,728
have no idea nor do I have any control

221
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,588
over what happens to this product once

222
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:10,449
it has entered the dispensary and it has

223
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,949
left my custody now

224
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,300
earlier I did mention that there's not

225
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,430
much back stock in that we're not

226
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,560
hanging on to a lot of product we do

227
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,028
deliver enough product to last about a

228
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,610
week so we don't have to keep making

229
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,348
deliveries every day so there will be a

230
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,629
little bit of excess product in the

231
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:26,918
store there is probably that bag of two

232
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,930
pounds of gold and goats sitting

233
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,240
somewhere in the stockroom now what will

234
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,219
happen is an employee will get the jar

235
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,198
that is on display it will take that to

236
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,940
the stockroom and they will fill it up

237
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:39,399
with as much gold and go fits in that

238
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,959
jar for the sake of this conversation

239
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,908
we're going to say that jar probably

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,979
holds two ounces so they're gonna pull

241
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:46,778
out of that 32 ounce bag I just sent

242
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,180
them they're gonna pull two ounces and

243
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:51,220
put that in a jar that jar is now going

244
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:54,099
to go on display like we said earlier

245
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,170
who knows what happens to that big

246
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,120
two-pound surplus bag did they seal it

247
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,159
back up did they leave it wide open I

248
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,129
don't know that's where the problem of

249
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,528
the Colorado crunch begins so at this

250
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:07,360
point we've got the big bulk bag it's

251
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,948
got about 30 ounces remaining in it

252
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,990
that's in a storeroom somewhere that I

253
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,208
can't see I don't have access to I have

254
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,190
no idea what's going on that is where

255
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,899
the Colorado crunch is beginning now

256
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,940
let's talk about this display jar

257
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,919
they've pulled out two ounces and it is

258
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,380
on display it's on the top shelf it says

259
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,969
golden go shoppers are going to come in

260
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,889
all day and they're going to see the

261
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,379
golden goat now here's what happens in a

262
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:31,629
dispensary you walk in you look at the

263
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,519
jars you see the labels something gets

264
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,769
your attention and then you start by

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,049
saying can I smell the whatever and you

266
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,850
pick a jar in this conversation I'm gone

267
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,588
with my golden goat the blood tender

268
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,420
will turn around grab the jar get the

269
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,639
golden goat off the jar or off the shelf

270
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,219
then they will pop the lid of that jar

271
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,919
and let you smell it now it depends on

272
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,560
how busy your specific dispensary is but

273
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,318
imagine how many times in one day that

274
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,268
jar is going to be opened and closed so

275
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:59,919
here's what happens you close the jar

276
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,600
there's a little bit of moisture in that

277
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,549
but there should be moisture in the bud

278
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,409
we want that that is properly dried and

279
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:08,078
cured we've got some moisture in there

280
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:10,000
when we seal it up that moisture starts

281
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,979
to move around it wants to even itself

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,539
out it wants to redistribute all through

283
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,550
that jar so if you've got one bud in

284
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:16,899
there it's kind of wet and one but

285
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,370
that's not they're gonna kind of even

286
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,139
each other out inside the jar the

287
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,629
moisture is gonna move around that

288
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,610
moisture will also be in the air inside

289
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,528
the jar it will be moving around in the

290
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,839
environment in the atmosphere in the jar

291
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,789
we crack open the lid now guess what

292
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,740
happens all the moisture goes flying

293
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,179
right out of the jar you stick it up to

294
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,459
the customers nose they give it a smell

295
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:38,679
I'll take an eighth of that the bud

296
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,929
tender pulls out an eighth 3.5 grams

297
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,269
throw into a little container seal it up

298
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:45,039
put the jar put the lid back on the jar

299
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,379
put the jar back on the shelf ask you

300
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,139
what else you'd like now that process

301
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,198
happens to that jar over and over and

302
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:54,909
over again all day if they shop from it

303
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:57,669
or not they may choose not to even buy

304
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:59,259
that so we got opened it got that cycle

305
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:00,789
it got the moisture built up it got

306
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,528
cracked open and let the moisture out

307
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,480
then it got resealed so it can repeat

308
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,058
the process and that happens all day

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,560
every day until all of that product is

310
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,419
soul

311
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,059
now something that dispensaries like to

312
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,709
do it looks way better to have full jars

313
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,809
it's just more appealing it looks better

314
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,610
on the shelf as a retail manager we'd

315
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,219
like to see full jars instead of half

316
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,500
empty jars so when that jar starts to

317
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,778
look a little empty about half way most

318
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,909
retail managers will send a budtender to

319
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,309
refill that jar so it looks like you've

320
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,659
got big full fresh jars and it looks

321
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,429
like you've got a lot of product and

322
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,259
it's more inviting now what happened to

323
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:36,209
that product on the bottom it is still

324
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,549
on the bottom it's been getting open and

325
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,019
closed for even longer now and it's just

326
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:42,240
gonna continue to sit there on the

327
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,000
bottom so that is a lot of what is

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,909
contributing to the Colorado crunch I

329
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,370
feel like I try very hard to prevent

330
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:52,350
crunchy herb in the commercial grow

331
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,720
environment it is hard we have to

332
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,060
maintain a perfect environment in a very

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,070
large room it does require a little bit

334
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,559
of equipment and it requires a lot of

335
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,379
attention to detail but I feel like I do

336
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,689
a very good job at delivering a properly

337
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,460
dried and cured product I'm not trying

338
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,740
to pass the buck but I feel many

339
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,870
commercial cultivators take as much

340
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,610
pride and their product as I do and I

341
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,129
feel like this Colorado crunch is

342
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,889
happening after the product leaves the

343
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:21,720
custody of the grower at the facility I

344
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,600
feel like it is happening in the back of

345
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,430
the store and it is greatly happening

346
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,310
because of that jar being opened and

347
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:32,069
closed all day so that is my explanation

348
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:33,719
of the Colorado crunch I understand that

349
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,460
it's happening it's not something that I

350
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,350
can fix it's not something I can do

351
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,210
anything about but I hope I taught you

352
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,100
guys about the Colorado crunch I hope

353
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,300
you understand what the crunch is and I

354
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,519
hope you understand why it's happening

355
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,649
and I hope you see that I understand

356
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,370
that it's an issue but also understand

357
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:52,919
that it is beyond my control now I do

358
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,839
have a solution to the Colorado crunch

359
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,969
what type of podcaster would I be

360
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,589
what kind of commercial consultant would

361
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,509
I be if I just came and told you about a

362
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,240
problem but I did not offer any type of

363
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,809
solution I do have what I feel is a good

364
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,419
solution

365
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:09,869
but what I have noticed is consumers do

366
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,909
not like this idea in my opinion the

367
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,580
solution to the Colorado crunch is

368
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:16,409
pre-weighed and prepackaged products if

369
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,240
we had everything pre-weighed and

370
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,549
prepackaged we wouldn't be opening that

371
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,750
big jar all day every day and we would

372
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,359
be able to Maine

373
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,690
the proper dry and cure moisture level

374
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,759
that we desire in that stock my ideal

375
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,770
scenario would be that we've got a small

376
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,509
jar of each offering available on the

377
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,129
counter but you can look at at your own

378
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,019
leisure you can just grab the jar pop

379
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,700
the lid give it a smell and if you want

380
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,529
an eighth of that let me know all I've

381
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,930
got to do is turn around and grab a

382
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,579
prepackaged eighth off of the shelf and

383
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,739
hand it to you that would be

384
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,200
advantageous in a couple of ways first

385
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,460
off it would save bud tenders time the

386
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,650
bud tender wouldn't have to weigh out

387
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,240
your eighth while you're standing there

388
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,220
staring at me and I've got a line of

389
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,990
customers behind you that also would

390
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,340
like to get an eighth so a pre weight

391
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,590
eighth would make it quicker you say I

392
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,200
want golden go I reach back golden go

393
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,649
bro ready to go also it's any container

394
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,780
it is sealed a lot of companies offer

395
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:11,939
nitrogen sealed cannabis in a container

396
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,039
some people are against that some people

397
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,800
are all about it I don't see any problem

398
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,870
with it because it keeps the herb

399
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,819
deliciously fresh it doesn't get too dry

400
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,769
in that container it doesn't get funky

401
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,200
in that container and it is just as good

402
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,329
as it was when the grower sealed it up

403
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,490
when he felt it was perfectly dried and

404
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,100
cured so I think a pre-weighed product

405
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,930
is the way to go now the reason a lot of

406
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,820
people don't like the pre weight product

407
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,559
is because they are old school and they

408
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,379
don't trust the person who is selling

409
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,629
them their cannabis you guys this is a

410
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,399
retail environment we are going to be

411
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,439
there tomorrow we paid a lot of money

412
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,720
for all of our licensing we've got a

413
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,360
reputation to uphold our name of our

414
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,720
business is on a sign out front of the

415
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,330
building there's no need to sell anybody

416
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,360
a short bag in the legal cannabis

417
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,220
industry your bag is going to weigh your

418
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,860
product will be what you expected it to

419
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,350
be even if it was pre weighed before you

420
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,720
came in there is a packaging department

421
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,790
we hire competent people to work in the

422
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,290
packaging department their only job is

423
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:14,969
to wait all day

424
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:16,949
they put those ace in the container they

425
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,810
seal it up put a sticker on it put it in

426
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,370
the bin at the end of the day all of

427
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,199
those eighths are delivered to the store

428
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,269
and those are what would be sold to you

429
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,400
some dispensaries are doing that now in

430
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,039
California it is the common practice in

431
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,990
California you don't hear about the

432
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,829
California crunch so I think that

433
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,480
prepackaged

434
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,570
eights and quarters would be the way to

435
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,899
go for the few

436
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,790
to prevent the Colorado crunch I think

437
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,470
over time consumers will become more

438
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,870
comfortable with being given a pre

439
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,420
weighed eighth I think now a lot of

440
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,279
people still probably get their package

441
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:50,079
from the dispensary and a lot of people

442
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,029
probably drive home and dump their

443
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,430
package right on a scale to make sure

444
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,809
that it weighs and I'm sure that all of

445
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,489
those packages that you're getting from

446
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,459
a dispensary I'm certain that they all

447
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,190
weigh look at it this way most bud

448
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,519
tenders are hourly employees that also

449
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,410
get tips if they give you good service

450
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,789
and give you a nice eighth there's a

451
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,589
good chance that when you get home and

452
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:13,389
see that nice eighth the next time you

453
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,090
come back to shop you're going to give

454
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,740
them a better tip now they have no

455
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,230
incentive to give you a short bag

456
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,570
because the product is owned by the

457
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,920
dispensary it is not their product the

458
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,270
only reason they would want to short you

459
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,519
is because they don't want to sell all

460
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:29,319
of their weed if they short you half a

461
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,819
gram here half a gram there they can

462
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,470
sell a few more grams make a little bit

463
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
more money it's not street dealing

464
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,460
they're not gonna make any money that

465
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,860
product again belongs to the dispensary

466
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,540
they are an hourly employee so if they

467
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,980
don't put that half a gram or whatever

468
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,389
you think they're gonna rip you off into

469
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,190
your container they don't make anything

470
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,990
off of it so they want to give you your

471
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,520
product they want you to come back they

472
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,529
want you to keep shopping there they

473
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,149
wanted to develop a relationship with

474
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,579
you and they want you to start giving

475
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,529
them fatter tips so they'll think that

476
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,000
the dispensary is going to short you you

477
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,949
guys I got a press pause for one second

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,720
because I'm going to sneeze all right

479
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,730
podcast world after a nice little sneeze

480
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,920
fit and a couple of dabs I am back

481
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,480
excuse me for that I hope you couldn't

482
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,759
hear that sneeze in my voice for too

483
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,190
long I could feel that it was coming but

484
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,869
we all know that if I cut myself off I

485
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,460
will never remember what I was saying so

486
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:17,529
I was just trying to get my thought out

487
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,990
before I pressed pause anyway we are

488
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:21,730
back nicely medicated ready to keep

489
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,710
rambling I was talking about the

490
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,589
Colorado crunch and I was encouraging

491
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,700
you to not be afraid of a prepackaged

492
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,769
product

493
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,779
all right podcast world the next thing I

494
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:34,180
want to talk about is pre rolls

495
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:36,399
quite often I hear people complaining

496
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,320
about the quality of the pre rolls they

497
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,600
are buying from their local dispensaries

498
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,909
you can probably walk in and buy a joint

499
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,589
for about five dollars really convenient

500
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,910
if you're just hanging out going

501
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,168
somewhere and want to get stoned

502
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,749
that's a really easy way to do it

503
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,970
but quite often I hear people complain

504
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:54,829
about the quality of the pre-roll and

505
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,450
something that really breaks my heart is

506
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:59,058
when somebody tells me that they tried a

507
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,649
new strain perhaps something I bred or

508
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:02,658
perhaps something they think I may have

509
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:05,268
grown and they tell me that they did not

510
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:06,649
like the pre-roll I often feel like if

511
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:08,450
they would have purchased a gram or

512
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:10,219
maybe an eighth they would have gotten a

513
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,080
much better representation of the

514
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,450
quality of the product that I intended

515
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,499
to produce now let's talk about pre

516
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,669
rolls and why people complain about them

517
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:21,618
remember earlier I was talking about

518
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:23,869
that display jar do we open and close

519
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:25,878
all day and we just keep topping it off

520
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:27,980
with fresh bud well that stuff at the

521
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:29,719
bottom it's really dry it gets really

522
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,548
crunchy that's where all the bottom

523
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,839
popcorn buds goats we're all the stuff

524
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:33,769
that nobody really wants to purchase

525
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,408
ends up

526
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:39,378
so all that super dry super crunchy

527
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:42,379
super tiny [ __ ] all ends up in your pre

528
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:43,939
rolls when the dispensary is slow and

529
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:46,939
the bud tender doesn't have anything to

530
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,249
do they'll grab that jar of bottom dried

531
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,259
up crunchy popcorn buds and they'll pour

532
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:53,480
it into a colander or a strainer and

533
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,940
they'll use that to clean it up they

534
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,889
crunch it up real fine and real small so

535
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,320
that the buds fit through the colander

536
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:02,808
or the strainer and all of the stems and

537
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,908
the junk stay in the strainer so it can

538
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,940
be thrown away then that fine

539
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,470
dusty crunchy material is used to roll

540
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,538
all of the pre rolls that go on the

541
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,639
shelf so the next time somebody

542
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:15,528
complains about a pre roll just remember

543
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:18,288
it's because you were buying the very

544
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:21,288
bottom of the barrel literally and it is

545
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:23,388
also the cheapest item on the menu so if

546
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:25,999
you really want a good representation of

547
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:26,538
a strain don't buy the pre roll if it's

548
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,269
available

549
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:30,950
a lot of dispensaries offer

550
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,388
strain-specific pre-rolls meaning you

551
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,399
can go in and look at the menu and get a

552
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:36,888
golden go pre roll maybe you can get a

553
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:38,719
lemon Jeffrey pre roll even if it's a

554
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:40,849
lemon Jeffrey or a golden goat I still

555
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,249
suggest you get a gram or two and roll

556
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,469
it up yourself so that is my rant on pre

557
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:48,470
rolls the next thing I want to bash is

558
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,230
caviar or whatever they call it in your

559
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,829
dispensary it is really popular for

560
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,868
people to take buds small buds like one

561
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:59,388
gram size buds and then they roll it

562
00:19:56,868 --> 00:20:01,839
around in what they call honey oil it's

563
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:03,969
butane honey oil BHO

564
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,069
then once it's rolled around in the BHO

565
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,740
and it's nice and sticky they coat it in

566
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:13,149
Keef to be quite honest with you I am

567
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,950
always very suspect of caviar first why

568
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,659
did you want to hide your bud I want to

569
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,250
know why they hid the bud I want to see

570
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,870
the bud that's in there why did they

571
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,548
want to cover that up most people want

572
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:22,989
to show off their work why are you

573
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,950
hiding the buds I think there's

574
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,460
something to hide

575
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,080
that's my first suspicion second of all

576
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,750
why did you hide the oil you rolled it

577
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:32,980
in oil it made it nice and sticky it

578
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,480
kind of makes me question the

579
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,940
consistency in the quality of your oil

580
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,250
first of all then you coated that oil in

581
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,440
Keith it kind of just seems like you had

582
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,148
a bunch of [ __ ] it wasn't really up to

583
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,640
par and you thought you could take three

584
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:48,009
low grade products and combine them and

585
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,049
actually make one high grade product and

586
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,509
honestly I'm just not buying it I am

587
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:54,069
always very suspicious of the caviar I

588
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,929
think that's three products that we're

589
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,849
all problematic that were just combined

590
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,769
and put into one product so they could

591
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:02,500
put it on the shelf and get a little bit

592
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:04,210
of return on an investment that's just

593
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,130
my opinion on the moon rocks and caviar

594
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,720
I've never been really impressed by it

595
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,940
I've always found it a pain in the ass

596
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,538
to work with and again when you hide

597
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,548
your buds

598
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:13,990
I immediately wonder what you're hiding

599
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:14,440
what's wrong with the quality of the

600
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,909
flower

601
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,890
what's wrong with the quality of the oil

602
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,720
and why did you put a bunch of keys over

603
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,399
all of it to hide it all from me

604
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,470
all right podcast ruled that is enough

605
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:25,750
bashing products I just bashed pre-rolls

606
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,519
and I bashed caviar pretty hard I try

607
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,470
not to be negative Nancy on the podcast

608
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,658
but that's just my opinion I wanted to

609
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,669
give you a heads up as a consumer I feel

610
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:36,070
like it is partly my responsibility to

611
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,330
look out for the consumers I've got one

612
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,710
more quick thing I want to talk about

613
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,778
since I'm looking out for people

614
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,090
let's look out for the people who work

615
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:44,619
in the grows and in the dispensaries

616
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,678
here's a quick rant that I've wanted to

617
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:51,189
share if you work in the legal cannabis

618
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,610
industry I highly suggest that you look

619
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,009
into the rules the laws and regulations

620
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:58,959
involving your position make sure you

621
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:02,919
are not doing anything they can put

622
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,600
yourself in legal jeopardy unfortunately

623
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:10,630
if you do break the law at work under

624
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:14,629
somebody else's direction you can still

625
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,700
be arrested for a crime here's an

626
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,590
maybe you're a budtender and you

627
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,660
accidentally sell product to somebody

628
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:23,750
with an invalid license here's the

629
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,279
scenario a customer walks in they hand

630
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,289
their driver's license to the person at

631
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,178
the door they are a familiar customer

632
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,308
they've been there before the person at

633
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:34,009
the door looks at the ID really quickly

634
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:36,019
the picture looks right says Bill that's

635
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:37,789
Bill here's your ID back bill I'll buzz

636
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,160
e and go into the bedroom do your

637
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,259
shopping so bill walks into the bedroom

638
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,000
you as a budtender you say hey bill

639
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,619
how's it going because you know bill

640
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,359
bill has been there frequently you

641
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:49,669
already know what bill is gonna buy he

642
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,069
comes there so often so you say the

643
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,679
usual bill and he says yes ma'am or yes

644
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:56,869
sir and you serve bill right up you give

645
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,240
bill product you take Bill's money bill

646
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:01,159
leaves you may have just committed a

647
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,529
crime because you did not check Bill's

648
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,730
ID yourself you need to make sure that

649
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:10,339
Bill's ID is valid if that ID is expired

650
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,190
or invalid for any reason you just made

651
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:16,428
an illegal cannabis sale and you can be

652
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,009
arrested and charged with a crime now

653
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:21,500
that sounds like a very minor infraction

654
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:24,170
a very small detail at work but it is a

655
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,359
very serious matter which is why I felt

656
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,880
like again it was my responsibility to

657
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,759
make sure you are aware that you can be

658
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,160
arrested and charged with a crime if you

659
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,160
make a mistake in the cannabis industry

660
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,370
and this applies for almost any position

661
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,380
in the industry anybody in the industry

662
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:44,539
from an hourly paid budtender all the

663
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,000
way up to a salaried dispensary owner

664
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:49,369
can be charged with a crime if they are

665
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,140
found to be breaking the law so if you

666
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:53,989
work in the industry I highly suggest

667
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,540
you learn all of the rules all of the

668
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,970
laws and all the regulations around your

669
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:01,490
position if you were a budtender get

670
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,039
very familiar with which forms of ID are

671
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,380
acceptable if you are a budtender get

672
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:09,230
very familiar with transaction limits

673
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,880
small details like that can really keep

674
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,069
you out of trouble and it is your

675
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,630
responsibility we would like to think

676
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,730
that that responsibility falls on the

677
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,679
dispensary owner or your boss or whoever

678
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,509
you'd like to call that person but it is

679
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,030
not their job when you got that

680
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,919
marijuana Enforcement Division badge you

681
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,839
signed up and said I know the rules and

682
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,159
I'm willing to play by your rules

683
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,278
and at that point it is your

684
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,039
responsibility to know those rules so

685
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,359
again learn the rules learn the laws do

686
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,579
a little bit of reading and keep

687
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,219
yourself out of trouble if you have any

688
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:41,778
questions in the state of Colorado we've

689
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,360
got the marijuana Enforcement Division

690
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:46,278

reach out to them they are very easy to

694
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:55,548
get a hold of also many facilities have

695
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:57,409
a compliance officer a compliance

696
00:24:55,548 --> 00:25:00,019
officer should have most of the answers

697
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:01,940
to all of your questions and if not they

698
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:03,589
should be familiar enough with the rules

699
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,028
to where they can skim right through the

700
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,558
rulebook and get to the section that

701
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,970
applies to what you're asking and they

702
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,548
should be able to answer you in just a

703
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,950
few hours I'm not sure the rules the
