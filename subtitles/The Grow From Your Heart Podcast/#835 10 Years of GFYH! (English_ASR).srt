redirect.sh seeing people run a

60
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,878
humidifier and a dehumidifier at the

61
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,318
same damn time it's funny that that's a

62
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,799
pet peeve of yours because honestly bro

63
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,799
I do that [ __ ] all the time I'm here in

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Colorado where the temperature uh the

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
humidity level uh it changes drastically

66
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,919
over the next couple of days uh like two

67
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,878
days ago I was wearing a jacket it was

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,439
snowing I had my snowshoes on I was

69
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,158
wearing a beanie had a scarf I was out

70
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,519
in the cold uh super super cold now

71
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:58,959
today it was 75° out there I was out

72
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,158
there in joggers in a t-shirt just

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,360
loving the sunshine so here in Colorado

74
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,280
we get drastic drastic changes I can't

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,400
risk having those changes Outdoors

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,598
affect my indoor grow environment my dry

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,599
and cure spaces the way to do that is

78
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,238
put enough equipment in there to keep

79
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,158
those parameters the way you need them

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,799
to keep that environment how you need it

81
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,439
I often talk about running the

82
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,480
humidifier and dehumidifier at the same

83
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,239
time I'll set them both in a dry and

84
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:28,598
cure environment especially I will set

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:32,200
them both at 55% 55% humidity

86
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,639
55° um 55 degrees in the room 55%

87
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,359
humidity on the humidifier 55 on the

88
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,479
dehumidifier let all three of those

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,400
pieces just work it out together all day

90
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,399
long so we've got a humidifier a

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
dehumidifier and an air conditioner just

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,039
banging it out all day making sure the

93
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,399
environment stays the way that we need

94
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,878
it so um I understand it's a pet peeve

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,719
to some people but uh in Colorado man

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,399
I've got to do what I have got to do I

97
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,318
can't risk I getting too hot or too cold

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't let it get too dry or too wet

99
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:01,000
and I do have that opportunity like I

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,120
said because of the major swings in my

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,280
environment here uh we had snow a couple

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
of days ago we have heat today I'm sure

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,919
that in just a couple of days because of

104
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,919
these changes we're going to get some

105
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,958
rain or some sort of moisture just how

106
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
the environment reacts here so then when

107
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,319
that moisture comes that rain comes my

108
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,599
humidity will spike in my dry and cure

109
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,238
room that dehumidifier will help me out

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,479
there um so yeah I do get it it drives

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,679
you crazy but that's what I've got to do

112
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,079
so sometimes uh those weird things that

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,959
you see there's actually a huge purpose

114
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,879
for that so my friend frog Slayer thank

115
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,439

to me the sun was setting there's a

137
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
little bit of wind coming from behind me

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,560
uh there was a tree next to me and for a

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,160
minute there everything just felt

it's comfortable but the grass is uh

144
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,759
slightly cold and cool and it cools your

145
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,279
butt and it cools your feet so on a hot

146
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,000
day you sit in that cool grass in the

147
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,478

179
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,239
acknowledge that I had to have a

180
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,319
listener send me an email letting me

181

know that this podcast has been going

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,120
for 10 years years that is wild to me to

183
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,878
think that I've been doing the show for

184
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,840
10 years uh there were uh I think the

185
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,879
first 500 and something episodes were

186
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,439
Audio Only and then around 600 or 650 I

187
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,280
started putting out the video because of

188
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,879
the uh we were locked down and had that

189
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,399
crazy virus thingy that happened to all

190
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,280
of us uh but 10 years is wild to think

191
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,038
about I've been doing this podcast I can

192
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,439
remember the first episode I know who

193
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,000
was here uh I can um Invision that time

194
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,399
frame this uh area wasn't even set up

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,160
that way the table was a different

196
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,198
direction everything was different back

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,520
then uh my how we have grown a lot of

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,360
people will message me they'll say hey

199
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,318

201
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,000
archives sometimes that is so

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,240
embarrassing but at the same time uh

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,680
it's great to hear how far the show has

204
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,400

microphone sound I used to have a big

206
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,799

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
dial it in uh will my idea of the slurry

279
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,120
ever come to fruition but who knows what

280
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,120
the future holds of cannabis also who

281
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,959
knows what the future of cannabis holds

282
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,120
for uh State legalization national

283
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,078
federal legalization then what about

284
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,560
worldwide legalization of cannabis then

285
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,799
that opens us up to Commerce what if uh

286
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,638
the Americans and the Canadians uh can

287
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,000
freely move their cannabis back and

288
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,639
forth what if we could take cannabis

289
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,480
down south what if I can mail cannabis

290
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,680
to my buddies in Jamaica what if my

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
Jamaican friends could send me cannabis

292
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,759
what if what if like I'm I'm curious

293
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,159
where will we be in 510 and then my

294
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,879

295
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,679
100 years um I hope I'm not podcasting

296
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,320
in a 100 years I will that will be a

297
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,879
very boring old man podcast you probably

298
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,040
don't want to hear that one but I hope

299
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,120
by then somebody has has grabbed the

300
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,879
torch that I have lit uh that I have

301
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,399
received from previous Growers previous

302
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,320
breeders shout out to subcool I hope by

303
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,120
then somebody grabs this torch and runs

304
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,040
with it uh and does a lot of things I

305

307
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,959

308
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,000
it be as a community uh as a commodity

309

00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,120
time uh they do have about a 30-day

338
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,679
expiration date on there and that's I'm

339
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,360
trying to be generous but also I've got

340
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,838
to keep the business in line and um

341
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,839
having a bunch of gift cards out there

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,240

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,920
as a business own it's like I feel like

344

I owe it makes you feel like you owe

345
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,838
something and you always want to be able

346
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,480
to cover what you owe so they do have to

347
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,399
have an expiration date and that that

348
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,639
encourages you to shop more quickly

349
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,480
anyway I am rambling the gift cards do

350
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,000
expire that expiration date is real and

351
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,278
that's just the way that it's got to be

352
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,759
so please uh shop quickly all right that

353
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,799
covers that disclaimer let's keep it

354
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,480
moving because I have got some momentum

355
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,719
happening and it feels good to be on the

356
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,360
microphone uh this next message once

357
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,399
again came from the growel tab on iry

358
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,560
genetics.com this one came from my new

359
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,278
friend where is the name my friend we're

360
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,838
going to call them Jeff shout out to

361
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,240
Jeff for the great message it says I saw

362
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,560
that you had skunk testers yes a couple

363
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,000
of weeks ago maybe a month ago by now I

364
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,799
did release two different versions of

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,078
skunk testers there's the 90s and the IR

366
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,240
skunk two different uh different crosses

367
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,638
I'm not going to tell you too much they

368
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
have a common parent uh but then the uh

369
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,959
the other parent is different so that's

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,278
more information than you've had I don't

371
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,799
like to give you too many details on

372
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,639
testers because it will uh it will bias

373
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,958
and sway your testing I want you to test

374
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,799
it and see what you see not what my

375
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,879
words influenced you to see is why I

376
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,759
don't talk about it but it says uh I am

377
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,799
not in the position to be a tester I

378
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,679
appreciate that you didn't buy testers

379
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,359
and put them in a drawer uh you know

380
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,198
that you're not in the position to do

381
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,399
that so you held off you're waiting

382
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:52,719
you're being polite that is very cordial

383
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,480
I respect and appreciate that of you and

384
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm going to do an episode very soon all

385
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
about tester seeds uh that will be a

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,759
very fun one for everybody so stay tuned

387
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,600
but this message does say uh but I have

388
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,000
been looking for the old stinky three

389
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,680
bagger skunkweed from my youth yes my

390
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,198
friend we all have it says um I Heard

391
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,000
because of the illegal nature of

392
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,039
cannabis they have managed to take the

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
smell away I want that smell yes me too

394
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:23,439
dude um so there was a time period when

395
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,519
uh there was a cannabis boom uh ganja

396
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,240
growing got real popular in a large

397
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,240
cultivation setting in a commercial

398
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,839
environment but it was an illegal

399
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,560
environment still uh those operations

400
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
got busted I believe that that's why a

401
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,838
lot of our favorite strains kind of

402
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,838
disappeared for a little bit is because

403
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,000
those large grows with that stank got

404
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,040
busted so I believe that you're on to

405
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,078
something when you say that uh cannabis

406
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,559
kind of got away from that super stank

407
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,679
smell because we were trying to hide the

408
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,559
aroma and be a little bit more discreet

409
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,319
if you came to the front door and were

410
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,399
delivering a pizza or looking for your

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,440
lost cat or trying to sell me Bibles or

412
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
whatever they do uh and I open the door

413
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,639
and it smells like skunks you know I'm

414
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,959
growing weed that's going to raise some

415
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,278
suspicions if you open the door and it

416
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,838
smells like oranges or strawberries

417
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,360
there's a chance you may think I'm

418
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,680
eating oranges or strawberries or

419
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,919
something different is happening in

420
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,919
there you're not just going to go he's

421
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,639
growing a bunch of weed in there I just

422
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,078
gave us an opportunity for a little bit

423
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,000
more camouflage a less a little bit less

424
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,399
obvious bit of aroma so I do agree with

425
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,480
you I believe that that is part of why

426
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,879
uh we swayed away from that skunky

427
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,319
stanky smell but now but now uh ganja is

428
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,159
getting legalized almost everywhere and

429
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,719
people that remember that old stank

430
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,759
smell we you they uh we all want it back

431
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,240
and I was missing that skunk smell I

432
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,360
remember my uncles I talk about my

433
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,039
uncles a lot I had three uncles two of

434
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,600
them heavily influenced my cannabis

435
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,318
career intake consumption um

436
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,680
appreciation they're both gone now rest

437
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:49,958
in peace boys I love you and miss you

438
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,758
every day but um these two uncles uh

439
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,799
they smoked the skunk weed back in the

440
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,600
day and they got excited about skunk

441
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,758
weed my one Uncle would be like hey uh

442
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,440
I'll say their names cuz they're gone

443
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,318
Eric would be like Hey Ron I got some

444
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,839
skunk weed and Ron was kind of a heavy

445
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,599
set dude and that [ __ ] would run

446
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
up to the smoking area when there was

447
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,839
some skunk weed to smoke the ants the

448
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,360
[ __ ] my ants that were around they

449
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,399
would come and not ants like little ants

450
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,079
my aunts my uncles's sisters they would

451
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,440
show up and want to smoke too oh brother

452
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,838
you got some good skunk weed and they

453
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,920
would [ __ ] get extra lit and then uh

454
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
the whole house would smell like a

455
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,039
[ __ ] skunk so I remember skunk from

456
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,838
when I was little and my uncles were

457
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,639
hyped on skunk so I understand that we

458
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,160
all want that skunk back um my dude said

459
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
you had skunk testers but I wasn't in

460
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,120
the position to test test them that's

461
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,278
[ __ ] respectable thank you uh but you

462
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,360
do want that skunk any

463
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,919
recommendations my recommendation that I

464
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,519
can recommend right now is stay tuned um

465
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,078
those testers that I put out were

466
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,159
basically a preview a very uh tip of the

467
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,159
iceberg of my skunk

468
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,039
experimentation uh I have fallen in love

469
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,759
with a couple of skunk phenotypes that I

470
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,399
played with I don't want to talk too

471
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,159
much about it in the future once some of

472
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,159
the skunk testing that has gone out has

473
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,519
been completed I will tell you uh where

474
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,759
the skunk seeds and clones I played with

475
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,318
came from there were two different

476
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,480
batches of seeds three different batches

477
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:06,599
of seeds two that got selected from that

478
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,679
were that had the keepers I wanted uh

479
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,558
one clone that is really popular got put

480
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,120
into the mix so there were three

481
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,000
different skunk parents that are kind of

482
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,000
getting gangbanged and different

483
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,679
manipulations around those I'll tell you

484
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,640
more about that but stay tuned because

485
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,839
there's more skunk coming that skunk

486
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,559
pollination uh didn't happen to just a

487
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,838
couple of plants there were many many

488
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,199
plants in the room I can tease that

489
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,879
there was a BC Lemon Skunk female in the

490
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,519
room that got pollinated by the skunk

491
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,919
number one what that's going to be wild

492
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,440
uh there's a Durban Poison that got

493
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,038
pollinated by that skunk um a lot of

494
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,480
stuff got pollinated so those will be

495
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,400
trickling out slowly over time and then

496
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,360
there will be more of these all remade

497
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,679
and then rebred together and other

498
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,918
things I'm in love with this skunk

499
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,280
project so uh my recommendation is stay

500
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
tuned and keep an eye on the website uh

501
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,079
because eventually there will be some

502
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,359
skunk stuff that is tested that will be

503
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:59,038
released and it's coming um I don't want

504
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,639
to say soon because breeder talks soon

505
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,240
is way different than consumer talk when

506
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,360
I say soon to you guys you're like is it

507
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,079
ready yet and I'm like it's it's growing

508
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,918
I'm sorry I shouldn't have said soon but

509
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,879
breeder talk grower talk and consumer

510
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
talk different time levels there when

511
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,480
you say soon my recommendation my Bros

512
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,359
stay tuned there will be more skunk

513
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,319
coming I'm in love with the skunk can't

514
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,639
get enough of it that smell that Aroma

515
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,879
that flavor what if I put the the skunk

516
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,280
number one to chem 4 and chm91 and stuff

517
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,840
like that what if all that happened what

518
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,079
it's coming stay tuned we just want to

519
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,720
grow it before you guys get to it uh my

520
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,798
hope is that you trying to recreate it

521
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,319
yes trying to recreate it and also add

522
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,679
it to other things uh put skunk to

523
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,720
everything that's kind of one of the new

524
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
ideas here and also narrow down some

525
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,558
skunk turps that we like I want to say

526
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,319
so much dude but I can't reveal too much

527
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,119
with uh the testing that's happening I

528
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,639
don't want to sway you but stay tuned

529
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,319
because it's all in my head and

530
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,679
obviously I'm excited about it so I will

531
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,879
talk about it once we get uh a lot of

532
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,159

right let's keep this good momentum

555
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,839
going I've got another question here in

556
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,440
front of me this one also did come from

557
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:47,000
that growel tab at iy genetics.com this

558
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,279
one came from lunchbox boys Tai big

559
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,480
shout out to Tai keep that lunchbox

560
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,480
strong I don't even know what that means

561
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,440
the question says yo roster Jeff I hope

562
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,360
all is well with you and your family I

563
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,320
have a smoker's question this is a great

564
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:01,439
question

565
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,200
it says I have been dabbing for about a

566
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,279
year now uh welcome to the party my bro

567
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,798
then it says I need something to travel

568
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,240
with any suggestions I always hear you

569
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,839
say you've been on dabs and I was just

570
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,400
curious how you dab when on the road all

571
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,359
right that's a good question now let me

572
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,120
uh let me preface all of this with the

573
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,038
disclaimer uh rosta Jeff is a fictional

574
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,918
character and I do not dab in the car uh

575
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,599
on the road while I'm driving I would

576
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,159
never do anything like that because I

577
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,678
don't believe that that is legal here in

578
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,080
the beautiful state of Colorado and I am

579
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,280
a law-abiding citizen and I encourage

580
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,879
you to do the same thing however if

581
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,038
cannabis were completely illegal and we

582
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,200
were allowed to smoke while we drive I

583
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,640
would definitely take big fat Dabs out

584
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,080
of a puffco peak Guardian that's what I

585
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,080
use on the road allegedly uh it's a good

586
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,678
device it is a little bit spendy it is

587
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:56,319
not the cheapest uh portable smoking

588
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,759
apparatus but what I like is the puffco

589
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,839
guardian or very similar as the the

590
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,640
puffco peak Pro that's probably the one

591
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,759
that is more available uh the puffco

592
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,559
peak Pro uh it comes with a basic

593
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,879
chamber I like the upgraded chamber the

594
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,319
uh extra-large 3D chamber is the way to

595
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,799
go it gives you some more settings it

596
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,839
gives you bigger rips that is what I use

597
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,879
it fits in the cup holder it holds a

598
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,759
charge well it gives big fat rips it's

599
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,159
easy to maintain um it's easy to clean

600
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,519
out you just need a Q-tip and you can

601
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
Q-tip it up it holds a charge for a good

602
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,599
time it gives me plenty of dabs for

603
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,918
while I'm gone you can charge it with a

604
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:36,000
car charger if you need that um so what

605
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:39,038
I suggest my personal device would be a

606
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,240
puffco peak Pro get the good one get the

607
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,240
pro uh don't get the entry level model

608
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,759
if you've got the opportunity I like the

609
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,038
guardian it's a little bit better but

610
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:47,519
you don't need that if uh you're just

611
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,319
going to be using it in the car or

612
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:54,158
whatever um I recommend the puffco peak

613
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,240
Pro with the upgraded extra- llarge

614
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,400
chamber it's another 130 or 140 bucks

615
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,079
but it makes a huge free difference it

616
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,320
definitely does I am not a show per for

617
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,319
puffco nobody has paid me to say this

618
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,839
puffco has never given me a free

619
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,879
anything um I paid full price I just got

620
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,879
my daughter full disclosure she got a

621
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,600
for Christmas she got a puff Co I

622
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,799
[ __ ] paid full price for it no

623
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,918
discounts or nothing nobody pays me for

624
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,960
this I like the puffco that's what I'm

625
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,440
saying um sometimes you might want to

626
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,319
put a different topper on it um the the

627
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,798
smoking piece I don't do that because I

628
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,599
just uh I don't want to break an

629
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,359
expensive part that I travel around with

630
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,959
allegedly that might be in the car now

631
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,558
me uh having said that I prefer the

632
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,960
puffco my buddy hot rod is going to

633
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,480
argue with me and say the ca V2 is where

634
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,319
it's at there's another brand called

635
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Carta c a r ta they make a very fine

636
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:48,879
portable vaporizer unit uh that is very

637
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,919
comparable to the puffco a lot of people

638
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,840
will argue which one is better uh I have

639
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,159
the puffco it works for me my daughter

640
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,079
had a CA for quite a while it hit very

641
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,799
good but it died we sent it back for a

642
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,480
warranty they returned it it died again

643
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,639
both of our puff CES have been going

644
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
strong so that is where I stand on that

645
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,960
the ca seems like a good product for

646
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,159
most of my friends that have it they

647
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,558
enjoy it it rips well it's affordable I

648
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,480
prefer the puff Co those are the top two

649
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,480
there are several other portable smoking

650
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,960
devices that are available on the market

651
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,759
that are more affordable in my opinion

652
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,000
you kind of get what you pay for with

653
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,759
the these devices they do charge you too

654
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,079
much they are overpriced but the good

655
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,839
[ __ ] is expensive when it comes to

656
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:33,759
uh portable smoking devices uh a lot of

657
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,639
people I see online I've got a lot of

658
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,079
friends with the Dr Dabber and the do

659
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,000
Dabber mini and then there's another Dr

660
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,839
Dabber I think it's Debbie Dabber or

661
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,200
something like that there's one with the

662
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,519
ball attachment on it that seems like a

663
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,480
quality device a quality product however

664
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,519
I have not hit it I've got a couple of

665
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,558
friends that I dab with on Discord and

666
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,200
it seems to be reliable and effective

667
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,839
for them but like I said I did not buy

668
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,000
one I don't know uh there's a another

669
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,158
product out there you know what I don't

670
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,079
like it so I'm not even going to tell

671
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,240
you there's one I don't like and I'm not

672
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,759
going to recommend it because I'm just

673
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,480
going to talk [ __ ] about it and Bash it

674
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,519
so uh I'm not even going to mention it

675
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,599
on the show we're just going to stay

676
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,038
classy uh I recommend the puffco either

677
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,038
the peak Pro or the guardian uh there's

678
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,960
another thing out there called the proxy

679
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,400
it works but it's not my favorite either

680
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,000
the puffco proxy if you're going to buy

681
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,159
a puffco uh get I like a when I take a

682
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,839
dab I need water I want water in my I

683
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,720
want bubbles it makes it so much cooler

684
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,678
more enjoyable so get the uh the

685
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,000
guardian or the Peak and skip the proxy

686
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,960
is my opinion I've got a friend with the

687
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,880
proxy I hit it it worked I didn't get

688
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,120
nearly what I would have gotten out of a

689
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,039
puff C Peak Pro so I think you get what

690
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,119
you pay for um they're quality products

691
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:45,398
if you get a good one and if I missed

692
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,719
something if there's a product you

693
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,439
recommend there's a comment section go

694
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,960
ahead and argue about it in the comments

695
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,840
I encourage it all right my buddy

696
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,120
lunchbox boys tie thank you for the

697
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,839
great question that question did qualify

698
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,759
you guys don't be shy the questions do

699
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:00,439
not have to be grow related the

700
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,240
questions don't have to be about growing

701
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,679
ganjo or about the Cannabis Community it

702
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,960
can be about a product it could be some

703
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,480
sort of weird advice uh I know some

704
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,278

a mental issue I'd be a guy with too

718

many toys and too many pieces of

719

equipment talking to myself and they

720
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,720
