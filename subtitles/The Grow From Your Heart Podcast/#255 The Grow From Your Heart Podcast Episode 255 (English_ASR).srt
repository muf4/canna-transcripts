good we got this recording equipment

31
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:59,890
figured out 26 episodes into the show I

32
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,989
opened up the recording software and hit

33
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,280
go and the recording equipment was just

34
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:07,989
giving me the middle finger it was like

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,879
no today took a couple of dry runs I got

36
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,859
fired up it's working good I think I've

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,199
done more damage to my head working on

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,300
this podcast like all of the concerts I

39
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:21,639
saw my early 20s working well medicine

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,050
it's working good class yeah well I

41
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,119
apologize for the other headphone

42
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,080
malfunctions there no we're good I don't

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
know what was going on with just

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,810
equipment today it was super loud and it

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:36,040
was super quiet and it was extra loud

46
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:38,259
and you guys don't care we're gonna read

47
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,780
some news articles we may actually play

48
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,479
a news article but first let's talk

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,819
about another email that I did not

50
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,959
include in the last episode I think it

51
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,370
might have been a Facebook message is

52
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,390
why I missed it shout-out to her friend

53
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,430
Rasta Seb

54
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,809
Rasta said has had a little bit of bad

55
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,340
luck but things will turn around for

56
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,620
your brother I feel bad for what

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,009
happened to you but Rasta said sent me a

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,569
question asking what is reclaimed we

59
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,609
can't laugh at the guy we got we got to

60
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,959
remember not everybody is smoking four

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,959
and five grams of hash on their day off

62
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,439
completely good question most people

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,390
well yeah a lot of people in Colorado be

64
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,400
like let's reclaim reclaim is this bro

65
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,319
so for all you folks out there who are

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,060
not able to consume a whole bunch of

67
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,719
Earl

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,729
spoiled - brat I talk to people all day

69
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,409
who have not like I don't even bother to

70
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,449
get to reclaim with them because like I

71
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:33,199
already gave my thesaurus worth the

72
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:35,719
[ __ ] priceless here okay so let me

73
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,689
tell you what reclaim is when we use a

74
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,009
dab rig we put a nail attached to the

75
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,840
rig somehow it either sits on the

76
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,069
outside of a mail joint or it sits on

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
the inside of the mail joint and then

78
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,519
you put a dome on it either way you heat

79
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,889
up that nail and then you put some hash

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,189
onto there and you inhale and as you

81
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:54,199
inhale some of that hash oil will

82
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,569
collect onto your rig just like the

83
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,909
resin collects on your pipe they doing

84
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:02,829
good so far Mike yeah okay just as we

85
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,829
vaporize the hash before it all gets

86
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,360
constitutes itself yeah and then a lot

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,200
of times it'll fill up in if you're

88
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,050
smoking BHO I highly recommend you using

89
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,608
a rig we call the rig a pipe it's a bong

90
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,290
yes it's a small bong I like a little

91
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,329
small bubbler especially a little hash

92
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,490
bong we call it we call it a rig but I

93
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,168
like something small I highly recommend

94
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,240
you smoke with something with water in

95
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:27,889
it you want that bubble action down the

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
hash is really hot just cool it a little

97
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,349
bit before it gets to your lungs and

98
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,769
throw it'll really help you out

99
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,140
so a lot of times the water will collect

100
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:37,759
a lot of reclaim in there so there's a

101
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,579
lot of Claim in the water there's a lot

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,750
of claim on the entryway to the pipe a

103
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,579
lot of times I'll use what's called a

104
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,129
drop down grabbing my drop down right

105
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,839
now to get it nice visual the drop down

106
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:49,639
goes on to the rig where the nail would

107
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,619
normally go and it's an extension of

108
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,120
glass it'll actually go a little lower

109
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,319
to get the nail out of your face a

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,030
little bit and get it further away from

111
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,719
your head and then the nail goes on

112
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,979
there and then a lot of the oil the

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,390
reclaim oil will collect right into here

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,860
and there's some here that we can talk

115
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,978
about there's I don't know that's

116
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,750
probably a measurement of one DRAM 1/2

117
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:10,250
DRAM I think is what that would be

118
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,110
probably if you poured it out to be half

119
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,180
a dram one of those little tiny vials

120
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,800
yeah they'd be half of one of those is

121
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,478
what I think so I've got a half of a

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,728
half a dram of reclaimed that I could

123
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,769
remove from here and do something with

124
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,750
so that's what reclaim is it's that's

125
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,539
basically reconstituted hash oil that

126
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,209
stuck to my piece what can you do with

127
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,430
it was one of his follow-up questions

128
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,209
I've seen people just stick the dabber

129
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,280
inside

130
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,228
of this mucky part and pull it out and

131
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,059
read a bit some people will do that our

132
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:40,519
friend forty-four he would do that

133
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,089
that's not against his standards lots of

134
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,859
people go for dabbing and I know a lot

135
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:49,098
of people who take great care to clean

136
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,229
it out and then try to like dry it out

137
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,538
drying it out as the part that I would

138
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:55,430
make really well leave it on on some

139
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,719
parchment paper or on an oil slick pad

140
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,610
make sure you let it dry really well

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
before you try to dab it again I talked

142
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,038
to one dude who's cleaning his rig with

143
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,539
Everclear so that he could throw that

144
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,550
into a glass dish when he was done

145
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:09,620
agitating getting his rig all clean and

146
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,348
then slowly evaporate that back down and

147
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,569
death like reclaimed powder I think our

148
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:16,129
friend Gary was uh teaching me about

149
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,240
that a while back so shout out Gary I'm

150
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,500
not sure if you still listen to the show

151
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,829
but he was talking about doing something

152
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,168
very similar our friend Fox was CBD CBD

153
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:26,918
extract Ron CBB I think what he would

154
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:31,250
say would be to make edibles that's

155
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,870
another people do it's already been D

156
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,610
Carr is it decarboxylase or

157
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,259
decarboxylated okay like you just picked

158
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,879
one I was gonna say you just pick I said

159
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,069
them both in my head I was like now the

160
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,959
first one sounds like it's bendy carved

161
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,969
because it's been heated to a

162
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,319
temperature above a certain beyond four

163
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,860
it's been he don't even know how hot the

164
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,658
surface of this nail is it is really hot

165
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,370
and it's reconstituted so it's been

166
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:56,839
activated essentially so many eating

167
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,280
it's already broken down so that your

168
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,129
body doesn't have to break it down as

169
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,098
much to make the psychoactive components

170
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:07,668
bioavailable well that was deep accident

171
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:09,199
but okay so that's what reclaim is I may

172
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,939
be an [ __ ] because what I do with it

173
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,770
is I fill my rig with rubbing alcohol

174
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,468
and I shake it up real good and I pour

175
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,089
that [ __ ] down the drain and ironically

176
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:22,579
for some reason my garbage disposal

177
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:24,019
doesn't work anything that would really

178
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:26,329
clog that thing up I don't put anything

179
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:32,269
down there I just need some like 90%

180
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:35,598
sure I need to pour a bottle I so I got

181
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:38,389
a whole bunch of reclaim in there I I do

182
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,579
the same thing if I've got a big fat

183
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,740
glob of reclaim sitting somewhere that's

184
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,478
easy to get to I'll use my torch

185
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,788
extract it real quick it's gonna heat it

186
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,649
up just a little bit turn it into

187
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:52,709
basically liquid yeah and then pour it

188
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:55,469
and do a silicone container and I use it

189
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,810
for seasoning my nail that's a great use

190
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,630
for it honestly it's the only reason I

191
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,430
keep it around and so I only do it what

192
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:04,110
I've got like a really fat glob sitting

193
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,120
there cuz what I've got now I could

194
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,710
season I 100 nails with so we're gonna

195
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,050
get another question what the hell does

196
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,598
he mean season your nail when you get a

197
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,009
new titanium nail just like any skillet

198
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,939
that you would want to cook on any pan

199
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,220
that you're gonna cook on you're gonna

200
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,408
want to put some oil or fatty substance

201
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:27,360
on it to grease it up before you cook on

202
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:29,129
it so that you don't taste that if

203
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,780
you're making pork chops you wanna taste

204
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,969
[ __ ] cast-iron and you don't want to

205
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,528
just taste raw titanium so when I get a

206
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,810
new nail I'll heat it up just to about

207
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:38,458
dab temperature and I'll let it cool so

208
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,958
that the nail so that the oil will

209
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,449
puddle on there and kind of soak into

210
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,909
the pores of the nail so you want to

211
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,990
kind of season your nail before you

212
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,429
start dabbing with the brand new

213
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,079
titanium eel and you can do with quartz

214
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,149
also once you get a quartz Neil

215
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:53,458
perfectly seasoned so smooth it tastes

216
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,559
really really nice I finally got to hit

217
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,088
a really nice quartz banger recently and

218
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,939
it tasted really good

219
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:07,320
shout out to boba blaster Co and the

229
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,139
let me grab my phone and we'll read a

230
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:29,819
Facebook message right quick yeah that

231
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,919
was a fun show to record I got some good

232
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,720
feedback on it from some people this

233
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,039
Facebook message stemmed from that

234
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,629
episode I'm pulling it up on my phone

235
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,838
right now this is impromptu it was not

236
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,838
fair - you guys are both here but uh it

237
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,110
seems like fair time to mention this

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,120
here we go this comment she said oh and

239
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,589
she has replied to my reply she said I

240
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,149
listened to this podcast and was sad to

241
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,250
hear that the libertarian candidates

242
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,000
were ignored or were entirely ignored

243
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,340
gary johnson is way better than san

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,259
Cannabis Johnson besides owning an extra

245
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,180
company even admits to using cannabis so

246
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,639
when Hillary Burt's burnt beats Bernie

247
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,259
which she will and then she leaves us a

248
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:11,139
link to follow so that we can read about

249
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:14,439
a future though I'm very familiar with

250
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,240
Garry Johnson I have a big fan I'm just

251
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,840
a realist

252
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,909
Gary's awesome but Gary don't have a

253
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,950
shot she said thanks I'm actually

254
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:25,689
rooting for Bernie for the DEM

255
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,570
nomination but my heart is with Gary

256
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:33,400
Johnson and she said it's not totally

257
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,230
impossible for Gary Johnson so it sounds

258
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,899
like Mike does what I do have an opinion

259
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,519
on is that Elizabeth I appreciate your

260
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,199
interaction with the podcast on Facebook

261
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,309
keep it up if you ever have any more

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,390
questions or anything you'd like to say

263
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,409
feel free to throw it up there on the

264
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:50,110
Facebook I like it thank you the the

265
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:52,360
Libertarian candidate is typically far

266
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,550
better on marijuana policy than the

267
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,639
Democrat or the Republican candidates

268
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:59,349
but they don't have a shot right now

269
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,710
like we just don't have that third-party

270
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,100
infrastructure in the United States

271
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,350

positive thing I'm gonna go to the

Internet for this one we're actually

297
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:58,269
going to play a quick video clip from

298
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:01,360
Channel 13 News here in Pueblo Colorado

299
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,949
and Colorado Springs um it says I should

300
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,230
give credit to Katie Spencer who is a

301
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,470
multimedia journalist

302
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,529
cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs

303
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:15,730
United and did something great they were

304
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:18,470
giving away free joints to people who

305
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,210
volunteered was this all of this some

306
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,009
just a small group there was a group of

307
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:27,110
them I know there's more than one the

308
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,819
article should tell us but I saw our

309
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,740
friends from one shop posting about it

310
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,390
and I saw the guy on this news articles

311
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,909
from another shop so I don't know how

312
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,080
many of the places participated but I'll

313
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:38,089
play the news article for you but what

314
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,980
they did was they were giving away a

315
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,720
free joint if you participated in their

316
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,370
litter cleanup program if you went and

317
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,110
picked up one bag of trash and brought

318
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,820
it back to the organizer of this event

319
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,340
he would give you a free joint and

320
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,330
there's an image of him standing here

321
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,970
unfortunately he's standing in the park

322
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,290
with a bowl of doob tubes full of joints

323
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,730
he's got the joints aren't exposed

324
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:57,949
they're in little containers right like

325
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,690
if I would have organized this event it

326
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,629
would be an organized slightly different

327
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,250
but I loved it for what it is and what

328
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,039
it did for the community it's a very

329
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,539
good item it's not a hundred percent

330
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,709
like put your best foot forward

331
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,629
necessarily as far as optics go but I

332
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,500
love it dude joints for picking up trash

333
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,580
all the way clean everything up what if

334
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,840
you could smoke the joint while you pick

335
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,889
up trash does that make it a lot better

336
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,889
[Music]

337
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,740
plenty people did that like it was just

338
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,939
bring me a bag of trash get a joint I'm

339
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,560
sure there were plenty of people who

340
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,000
brought him several bags of trash I

341
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:43,669
don't know how many people cleaned out

342
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,399
their car but stuff like that like the

343
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:48,860
consumption clubs can really push the

344
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,870
boundaries with like giving away product

345
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,639
and stuff like that like the shops can't

346
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,230
even give away product legally they have

347
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,580
to charge at least a penny right the

348
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,649
only way a dispensary would be able to

349
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,240
do that would to be if they checked your

350
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,799
ID before they let you sign up for the

351
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,649
program and then they would have to give

352
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,849
you a coupon it may give you a joint for

353
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,779
a penny because they can't give you

354
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,060
anything for free

355
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,919
right and so then you'd have to go back

356
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,750
to that shop and get the joint for a

357
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,579
penny with your coupon but then didn't

358
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,440
you just technically you're employed by

359
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,899
that dispensary if that happens you're

360
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,220
like kinda

361
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,909
not really cause they're just handing

362
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,889
out its hand coupons to this doesn't

363
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:26,708
know if you claim that's employment but

364
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:29,169
like I'm sure that I stink would get

365
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:31,179
raised if a dispensary actually did that

366
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,679
oh yeah to jump through for the

367
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,039
dispensary nobody would take tax money

368
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,989
on it right all sorts of things well the

369
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,539
shop would have to pay the taxes on that

370
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,789
as though it's sold at normal price I

371
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:45,099
bet it would be the bike that the shop

372
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:46,928
would have to take but like there's a

373
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,028
shop down here that's adopted to strip a

374
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,980
highway and I Drive that strip a highway

375
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:52,808
every day and it's always [ __ ] filthy

376
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,670
and I shake my head every time I Drive

377
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,588
and see that sign so they need to get

378
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,118
out there and clean it up part of the

379
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,589

380
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,980

384
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,619
event I wish more the industry was

385
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,659

trash bag at a time we're gonna go out

403
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,378
here on the west side and clean up down

404
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:58,328
here off the Cimarron in the park

405
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,089
started here at vermejo Park where

406
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:04,239
volunteers we're picking up trash for a

407
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:06,249
unique reward as you bring bags of trash

408
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,659
back to me I'm gonna give you a joint

409
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:13,720
per bag you bring back it wasn't just

410
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:15,308
about the free weed I hike every single

411
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,319
day and I see trash on every single

412
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:20,078
trail and it saddens me it was a

413
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:28,659
personal connection to their home so it

414
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:30,878
feels good to actually clean the park as

415
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:33,789
well as the reputation of the marijuana

416
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:50,620
industry to show that we are a positive

417
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:52,899
impact so every month that'd be cool to

418
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,970
see people picking up trash for pot yep

419
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,409
yeah so that shows you guys we're not

420
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,209
just a bunch of lazy stoners we do

421
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,620
contribute to the community we want it

422
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,119
to be cleaner we're at the park chillin

423
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,230
out enjoying our buzz we want it to be

424
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,088
clean we don't want to look around and

425
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,538
see trash everywhere right so because

426
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:09,730
this weird miss out there that because

427
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:12,129
we're associated with marijuana like we

428
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,028
want everything to be bad and destroyed

429
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,620
and that's stoned or I don't know that

430
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:19,179
we're like bad people and it's just

431
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,158
nonsense like we're people just like

432
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,610
everybody else is just we like cannabis

433
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,799
too

434
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,678
one thing I've noticed being around pot

435
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:30,369
heads a lot for the past 20 years is a

436
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,960
lot of them have OCD especially and I

437
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:35,048
may sound sexist but this is just what

438
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,569
I've observed a lot of women get got to

439
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:39,250
clean some [ __ ] OCD they get stoned all

440
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,538
those dishes are dirty [ __ ] all that and

441
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,278
they just go clean the dishes and it's

442
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,750
not it's just goes in their mind it'll

443
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:45,579
like those dishes can't be dirty it's

444
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,159
driving me crazy so they do the damn

445
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:49,928
dishes and pot heads get the same OCD

446
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,460
like there's trash everywhere I gotta

447
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,410
pick it up make my environment look good

448
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,269
it's just amazing

449
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,190
the bull I was a boy scout back in the

450
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:00,210
day like it was important of the people

451
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,370
around me that like when we went camping

452
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,890
not only did we do zero-impact camping

453
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:08,019
so I Leave No Trace camping but like we

454
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,970
actively pay attention and grab other

455
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,529
trash while we were out there like we

456
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,809
always had one pocket full of other

457
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,759
people's [ __ ] like on the way back

458
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,559
to camp at night just so that next time

459
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,099
we were up there it was a little better

460
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:23,379
than it was this time and like I do it

461
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:24,849
at my house too like when it's been

462
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,440
crazy windy down here so every night

463
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:28,359
when I get home I spend like two minutes

464
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,289
picking up other people's trash at my

465
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:33,269
front yard maybe we should put up a

466
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,559

488
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,129

491
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,470
bunch of plastic forks and I found a

492
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:31,319
stop sign out in the middle of nowhere

493
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,319

picking up trash for joints it's a great

495
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,959

497
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,569
the joints in the park next time that

498
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,370
looked a little weird on the news there

499
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,079
right that's the one thing that

500
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:52,839
everybody sort of has against the

501
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,849
consumption clubs is that some of them

502
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:59,359
have found a way to do some sort of

503
00:19:55,849 --> 00:20:01,909
distribution and we're giving joints

504
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,529
away in the park for bringing us bags of

505
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,538
trash like that's an awesome program

506
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,509
getting people to clean up trash I don't

507
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,829
care how you do it I'm gonna jump in and

508
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,319
interrupt you and do my part for the

509
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:15,109
consumption clubs I'm going to avoid the

510
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,048
work distributions we would much rather

511
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:19,668
hear the word reimbursement well I'm

512
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:20,629
just educating you and our listeners so

513
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,530
that we need if you guys come to a

514
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,440
consumption Club

515
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:26,450
don't say purchase don't say Buy ah see

516
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,460
may i reimburse you for some of that

517
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,110
fine quality product they're like

518
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,569
reimbursement is the key word in these

519
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:34,369
places and this is why it's important

520
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:36,089
how you [ __ ] vote I'm sick of word

521
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:40,169
games you just call them all [ __ ]

522
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,169
[Music]

523
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,480
we're just talking about how some head

524
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:48,490
shops in Colorado are still playing the

525
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,409
water pipe game because they have to

526
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,870
it's just nonsense it's because enough

527
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:55,370
of our generation isn't voting the water

528
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,529
pipe game I want to define the water

529
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:59,298
pipe game because some people might not

530
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:01,250
come into my marijuana store I'm happy

531
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:03,408
to show you the bongs on my shelf and

532
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,650
tell you how much my bongs cost but if

533
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:08,360
it's a head shop up the road shows you

534
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,890
the exact same thing they're not allowed

535
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,959
to call it a bong because if it's a bong

536
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,850
I might be use for marijuana and if it's

537
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,179
used for marijuana it's not really legal

538
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:21,048
legal to sell it's still against federal

539
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:23,179
law because you called it a bong yeah

540
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:28,308
it's 2016 we should be able to say can I

541
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:31,190
check out that bong 16 you should be

542
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:32,990
saying I'm in that rig right I'm sick of

543
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,029
the word games it's legal in Colorado

544
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,900
now and there are still places where you

545
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:41,558
have to say water pipe and I'm a huge

546
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,600
advocate for consumption clubs and

547
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,339
learning another word game makes that

548
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,709
harder

549
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:50,358
well that segues into my next news

550
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,759
article because you said consumption

551
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:54,769
clubs in you're a big fan but um this

552
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:56,960
article says this is from the indie the

553
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,819
Colorado Springs independent it was by

554
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,798
NAT Stein the article headline says city

555

lawsuit is coming and this is shocking

558
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,668
news because just a few days ago we were

559
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:08,959
told they had eight years to get their

560
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,609
[ __ ] together to recoup their

561
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,288
investments it was a really weird

562
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:14,298
decision they're too dangerous to be

563
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:17,239
open but they have eight years to recoup

564
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:20,598
their expenses like which is it so the

565
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:21,889
article goes a little bit like this nice

566
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:30,798
trying to hide that I heard that real

567
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:32,388

00:22:56,298 --> 00:23:00,408
of all stripes those who push back on

573
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:02,749
councilor Andy Pecos proposed resolution

574
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:04,399
opposing refugee settlement those who

575
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:06,079
delivered a petition demanding repeal of

576
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:08,838
the recently enacted pedestrian access

577
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,699
Act those who bombed the proposed land

578
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:12,528
swap deal with the Broadmoor and finally

579
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,330
those pleading once again for council to

580
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:16,219
keep the cannabis clubs on shuddered

581
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,408
none of that resolved except for the

582
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:21,739
club issue but not in a way most had

583
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,749
urged the clubs which remember ship

584
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:25,848
based social clubs that allow for adult

585
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:28,098
marijuana use have caused consternation

586
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:29,960
for city officials for several years now

587
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:33,739
they first started springing up after

588
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,669
voter approved amendment 64 in 2013 2014

589
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:36,558
excuse me

590
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,239
studio a sixty four one a zoning

591
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,098
violation appeal in which the city

592
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:42,319
granted the downtown club a similar use

593
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:44,450
determination in essence saying that

594
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,058
cannabis clubs are like social clubs so

595
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,259
are areas zoned as such and then in

596
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,088
parentheses it says permitted in

597
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,669
multi-family residential commercial and

598
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:54,678
industrial zone districts more clubs

599
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,389
opened up all over town even after the

600
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,729
six-month moratorium on new marijuana

601
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:00,229
business licensing began in September

602
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,890
the city couldn't stop

603
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,940
a license that did not exist then

604
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,530
earlier this month the Planning

605
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,600
Commission recommended banning the clubs

606
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,160
outright councillor Don Knight took the

607
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,019
ordinance to Council proposing the group

608
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,570
prohibit the opening of any new clubs

609
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,910
mandate licensure for all clubs that

610
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,619
operated prior to the moratorium subject

611
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,330
to all sorts of new rules and forced

612
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,489
those clubs to close doors after eight

613
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:25,548
years this is the ordinance Council gave

614
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:28,519
a final reading on Tuesday councillor

615
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:30,889
Bill Murray move the move to the table

616
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,629
the ordinance for six months so council

617
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,120
could work with the industry to develop

618
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,190
more moderate regulations in the end

619
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,989
council voted six to three in favor of

620
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,900
adopting Knights original proposal

621
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,269
councillors Jill Gabler and Helen

622
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,798
Collins joined Murray in voting no we

623
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:47,750
talked about limited government all the

624
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,700
time but limited government is not about

625
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,099
number of employees it's about limited

626
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,640
laws Murray said we're turning democracy

627
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:57,379
into a morality play Gabler said she was

628
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,330
skeptical of the pup of the public

629
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,549
process behind the measure or lack

630
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,569
thereof Collins on her part says she

631
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:04,819
didn't think a band would be

632
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:07,039
constitutional Knight and councillor

633
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:09,079
Keith King both argued the council had

634
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,029
already exercised its right under

635
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,029
amendment 64 to opt out of the retail

636
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:16,069
side of marijuana night cited articles

637
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,690
from The Gazette and Fox News as proof

638
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:19,369
those articles highlight the club's

639
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,660
practice of offering marijuana to

640
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:22,579
patients who didn't bring their own

641
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,490
sometimes in exchange for a donation or

642
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:27,139
reimbursement assisting other adult in

643
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,210
the use of marijuana is permissible

644
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,950
under act 64 is what this article says

645
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,019
this article is written in two different

646
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,400
colors so I apologize for my stutter it

647
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,599
makes my eyes jump around once and two

648
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,660
colors like that don't do that if you

649
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,250
type some [ __ ] that's coders and goers

650
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,600
took their opportunity during basic

651
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,660
public comments to try and correct some

652
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,759
misconceptions amber race ik owner of

653
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,890
studio a 64 insisted that cannabis clubs

654
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,558
are benign relative to bars that serve

655
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,910
alcohol she says I get off at 1 a.m. in

656
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:55,039
the morning and every time I Drive

657
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,750
downtown I see people outside the bar

658
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,609
stumbling around causing problems

659
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,039
getting into fights we are peaceful

660
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:02,959
peaceful people she said all we want is

661
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,819
a place to be accepted as human beings

662
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,870
smoking weed is how we choose to relax

663
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:09,889
and it isn't hurting one it's our right

664
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,959
presents Mercier I hope I said that

665
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,490
right patron and cousin of a local club

666
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,620
owner took a different tack

667
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,569
even if you hate pot that's fine she

668
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,489
said but we all love money right think

669
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,599
about what you'd gain from these clubs

670
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,390
and that's such a good point I mean

671
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,679
that's kind of a tasteless way to say it

672
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,150
but I mean it's the truth think about

673
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,560
all the money that you're gonna miss out

674
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,650
on if they closed all of these gloves

675
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:33,019
yep shutting down a bunch of businesses

676
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,390
I mean you lose you lose a lot more than

677
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,670
the sales tax payroll tax property tax

678
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,200
business tax and then all of the money

679
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,850
that those employees go spend back in

680
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,769
your community I mean I know this is

681
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,409
silly like there are places in the world

682
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,329
that already have these clubs owned and

683
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,740
regulated both counties happens to be

684
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:52,909
one of them it's just Colorado Springs

685
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,490
isn't one so they're pretending like

686
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,940
it's impossible and because they're

687
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:01,069
refusing to throw rules down and just by

688
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,140
alright follow these apply here and be

689
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:05,599
done with it they're gonna be doing this

690
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,490
nonsense for the next half decade they

691
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,429
need to figure out that loophole of how

692
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,559
people can reimburse the club for the

693
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,049
product that they use there right that

694
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,389
is the only that seems to be the lure

695
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:22,309
that like the club has to have a way to

696
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:25,400
survive and right now a lot of the rules

697
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:27,799
that are in place are like they can't do

698
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,009
anything other than sell prepackaged

699
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:34,069
drinks and snacks like you can't even do

700
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:37,519
like cold sandwiches

701
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:41,750
let alone like decent food it's just

702
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:46,039
nuts no way to reimburse for the product

703
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:49,609
like at that point right how do you

704
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,659
exist as an entity yeah I mean how far

705
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,609
out in the middle of nowhere do they

706
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,140
want to push it like eventually it's

707
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,119
just gonna be like it like cousin Earl's

708
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,420
farm and then that's pointless we just

709
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:07,909
need we like having a place in the

710
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:09,740
congregating area to be honest I've been

711
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,330
in those situations I've been out in the

712
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,390
middle of nowhere smoking because we had

713
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:15,799
to hide I've been to gatherings in every

714
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,840
environment you can imagine you know

715
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,700
what I mean from some random dudes house

716
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,500
to some hippies house to some gangsters

717
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,930
house I've been in every environment

718
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,539
smoking and those social clubs are the

719
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,070
ideal safest environment nothing's gonna

720
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,138
go wrong

721
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:31,569
I'm not on somebody's turf I'm in a club

722
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:33,638
it's come on hang up you paid the entry

723
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,019
fee you showed us your ID you're part of

724
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:36,490
our club we don't have anything against

725
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:39,069
you nobody here is in a different Club

726
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,859
did you come hang out let's smoke there

727
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:43,629
was a video that I saw years and years

728
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,569
ago where they're interviewing a coffee

729
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,789
shop owner in Amsterdam and that's what

730
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:51,788
the consumption clubs and Amsterdam are

731
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:52,869
called and he's been open for like 15

732
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:54,849
years and he goes there's never been a

733
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,408
fight in here just the bar across the

734
00:28:54,849 --> 00:29:00,398
street the police are there every night

735
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:02,110
every night and I mean it's just a

736
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,908
different it's a different type of

737
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:06,158
intoxicant it doesn't come with that

738
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,159
aggressive tinge

739
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,750
I see anti-pop people linking like

740
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,190
anytime there's a violent incident in

741
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,740
marijuana gets mentioned like they

742
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,690
posted up as though it was directly

743
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,609
caused by an assailant he wouldn't had

744
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,500
to go to Texas to find this story like

745
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:23,079
your town sold 17 million dollars were

746
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,940
the weed last year like if it was being

747
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:30,278
caused you could lick that article from

748
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:32,528
pueblos but problems with the clubs are

749
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,778
just they annoy people that really

750
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:36,308
really hate marijuana and that's the

751
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:38,288
biggest problem caused by allowing

752
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:41,918
consumption clubs is that you annoy the

753
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:42,908
squeaky wheel give it a few years

754
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,830
they're old

755
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:49,750
there's never been any trouble there I'm

756
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,980
gonna continue with this article joking

757
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,839
the being from Denver shouldn't be held

758
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,538
against him activist attorney Rob Corey

759
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,490
reminded council that amendment 64 but

760
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:59,440
she had a hand in drafting protects the

761
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,028
activities in question and Colorado

762
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,950
adults have the right to associate with

763
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:05,349
each other consume marijuana cultivate

764
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,000
it distributed and help others with all

765
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:08,798
of those things he said that's the

766
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,450
supreme law of the land the voters have

767
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,038
spoken and just like the other

768
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,870
constitutional rights which council

769
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,759
members swore to uphold the rights

770
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:18,729
afforded by amendment 20 and amendment

771
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:21,099
64 are non-negotiable Corey said that

772
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,929
may be difficult for you but that is the

773
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:24,128
reality

774
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,690
Jill Gaber asked Corey how other

775
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:28,058
municipalities in the state are dealing

776
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,470
with cannabis clubs not a single one has

777
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:31,538
banned that because they can't he

778
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,190
answered plus a city devoid of venues

779
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,408
for social consumption creates other

780
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,269
problems he explained marijuana will be

781
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,010
smoked by adults and groups no matter

782
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,089
what you do you can't prevent me from

783
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,589
inviting 50

784
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:44,079
my closest friends over to smoke pot

785
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:46,149
together so where are they going to go

786
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,250
coming soon to a neighborhood near you

787
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,840
yep right yeah if they ban the clubs

788
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,700
we'll just open the front door bro just

789
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:58,449
come on everybody in everywhere come

790
00:30:51,700 --> 00:31:00,038
just take some dad's in my house that's

791
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,200
part of the beauty of the club I love

792
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,548
that because I'm yeah I would go to the

793
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,019
club once or twice a week I would make

794
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:06,609
an effort to show up once a week or so

795
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:07,808
honestly it got to about once every two

796
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,668
weeks during trim time because we're

797
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,808
just busy but once or twice a week I'll

798
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:12,460
pop in there and try to spend an hour

799
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:14,889
there and say hi to people and I would

800
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,390
always meet new people and sometimes I'd

801
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,370
meet people that I wish would walk away

802
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,140
but most of the day I would meet people

803
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:24,069
are like damn I'm glad I'm friends with

804
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:26,528
that guy that's I like most of the

805
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:28,028
people I've met in the community but I

806
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:29,919
wish I could spend more time with

807
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:33,269
consumption clubs and I haven't felt

808
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,980
that way about a bar and forever but the

809
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:37,240
gray area they existed just annoys the

810
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,220
[ __ ] out of me at this point in time

811
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,298
like absolutely it's it's just

812
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,190
ridiculous at this point and that the

813
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:48,069
more people don't see this ridiculous is

814
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,630
starting to really annoy me you know why

815
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:51,069
can we yeah I've said this so many times

816
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,149
why can we have so many bars but we

817
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:54,278
can't have somewhere to smoke cannabis

818
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:57,069
it seems unfair and they voted to

819
00:31:54,278 --> 00:32:00,490
regulate that I always get for that is

820
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:02,798
well you can enjoy a one alcoholic

821
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,679
beverage without getting any sort of

822
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,950
intoxication but every time you consume

823
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,690
cannabis its to get high in its like

824
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,720
wool

825
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,340
sort of but you can also consume a small

826
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,370
amount of cannabis and get no high I do

827
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:19,209
it all the time I do it

828
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,099
consuming large amounts of cannabis

829
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,460
products when I'm consuming a straight

830
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:27,309
CBD stuff my first couple of dabs right

831
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,200
that's just like that's metrical

832
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,809
consumers like you and me like one or

833
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,940
two high THC dabs there's still no

834
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:37,119
intoxication that's just all sort of

835
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,350
pain kill it's different for everybody

836
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,719
and just to make that argument as though

837
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:46,240
most people don't go to the bar for more

838
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,360
than one drink or to feel some sort of

839
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,720
ease relief of stress or blow off some

840
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,279
steam

841
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,870
or get a nice buzz like I've been aware

842
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,769
of the phrase three-martini lunch since

843
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:01,929
I was like 5 it's just a nonsense

844
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,410
argument but I hear it day after day

845
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,690
from elected officials people in suits

846
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:10,180
people whose opinions being printed in

847
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,980
the newspaper it's just nonsense it's

848
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,539
unfair how come you guys have somewhere

849
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,829
to hang out and congregate and drink one

850
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,299
drink and I don't have somewhere to hang

851
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,250
out and congregate and take one damn

852
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,779
right it's the same damn thing all right

853
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,150
I'm gonna continue because there's one

854
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:23,559
more paragraph it says at the end of his

855
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,420
testimony Corey made a show of

856
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,069
delivering the icy attorney a draft

857
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,539
lawsuit he intends to file as soon as

858
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:30,849
the mayor signs the club ban ordinance

859
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,589
on behalf of nine clubs and 14

860
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:34,269
individuals who own or operate those

861
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:35,589
clubs the complaint asks for the

862
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,819
ordinance to be struck down for

863
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,649
violating plaintiffs rights of

864
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:40,929
association freedom of speech and due

865
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,120
process under the US Constitution as

866
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,250
well as their right to life liberty and

867
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,079
the pursuit of happiness religious

868
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,240
freedom and right to medical and

869
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,849
personal use of marijuana under Colorado

870
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,410
Constitution counselor I took exception

871
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:55,839
to the claim that counsel has no right

872
00:33:53,410 --> 00:34:01,060
to ban cannabis clubs we will talk about

873
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:03,459
that in court Corey said yeah so what

874
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,129
this happened they had four days to

875
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,809
draft the new rules and have the City

876
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,119
Attorney sign them is what I was told

877
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,889
and that should have happened I think

878
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,049
the day for that signing would be today

879
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,059
and as soon as that was signed is this

880
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,250
tourists of the velum as soon as the

881
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:20,650
paper was signed is when the law suit

882
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,719
went into so it's the 27th is when the

883
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,780
paper will be signed and that's when the

884
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,759
lawsuit will kick in

885
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,140
what I think I was told it'll be

886
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,320
interesting to watch this one play out

887
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,908
it sure will I do I don't want these

888
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,120
clips to get closed I want to be able to

889
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,950
go hang out I'm like we have rules form

890
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,109
down here it's just none of them are

891
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:41,239
open because essentially the rules mean

892
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,700
it's gonna be a huge upfront investment

893
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,869
in the rules also mean they've got to

894
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:49,579
make that investment back with a quarter

895
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,918
profit apiece on like prepackaged bags

896
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:53,480
of chips and bottled water this is

897
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,539
insane yeah and those buildings are

898
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,769
expensive yeah most parts of Colorado

899
00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:00,139
Springs right now are really expensive

900
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:02,059
all right so I've got one more news

901
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,799
article I want to talk about oh I want

902
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:07,219
to mention something everybody was

903
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,690
reading a CBD article from Facebook

904
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:11,359
everybody was sharing it that article

905
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,559
was a hoax you guys got all this riled

906
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,420
up I was looking at it a little further

907
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:21,799
and that actual article was a hoax

908
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:24,590
99% of it's a hoax it's based on a truth

909
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,769
like the FDA did set out warning letters

910
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:30,410
to different CBD companies but it was my

911
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:31,969
understanding that a lot of them were

912
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:35,059
the ones you and me were warning people

913
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:37,129
about a couple of months back right the

914
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,409
Chinese nonsense companies that are

915
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,360
liked two drops of this superior cancer

916
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:43,399
it's pure CBD and then they test it and

917
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,140
it's pure codfish oil or some [ __ ] right

918
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,400
well I read an article on Facebook that

919
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:48,710
was saying that the FDA sent out a

920
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,750
letter saw that that all reefs are all

921
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,030
CBD products were banned because it was

922
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,769
now FDA regulated right that was not

923
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,070
true that was a hoax so you guys saw

924
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,619
that

925
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,030
don't panic that [ __ ] was [ __ ] it

926
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,739
may come down the pipeline in the future

927
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,030
but as of this time that was a hoax that

928
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,279
was clickbait people were trying to get

929
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,690
you click and I bought the bait when I

930
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,490
read it I was like this isn't written

931
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,610
well it doesn't look right I need to do

932
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:12,739
some research it wasn't true so in a few

933
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,690
episodes ago continuingly we've been

934
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,639
talking about a raid that happened in

935
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,650
Santa Ana California when some police

936
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,750
officers raided a dispensary that was

937
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,190
open and full of customers but if you

938
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,280
don't know the butch raid were talking

939
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:28,820
about hit pause real quick and Google

940
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,560
Santa Ana police dispensary raid yes and

941
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,920
I should bring the video right up

942
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,659
so these cops were caught on camera

943
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,430
destroying this dispensary they ate what

944
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:39,588
I thought was edibles on camera but

945
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:41,179
our covers a little bit it tries to back

946
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,469
him up a little bit on that I can't say

947
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:42,858
that they were eating edibles I wasn't

948
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,959
there

949
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:46,699
this article kind of defends them the

950
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,349
headline says Santana cops and notorious

951

raid instead they're being prosecuted

978
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,940
for causing intentional damage to

979
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:02,389
legally disabled video cameras and

980
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,059
eating detour sample protein bars and

981
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:07,279
mr. thin stir cookies that were not

982
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:08,930
marijuana laced products on sale at the

983
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,200
dispensary but were simply snacks

984
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:15,649
available to staff I hate the word laced

985
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:18,019
I hate the word lace too but you know

986
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:21,048
basically the good news is charges were

987
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:24,500
filed the bad news is because the video

988
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:25,940
footage is so grainy they're claiming or

989
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,849
the cops are claiming that what they

990
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:32,690
were consuming were non infused products

991
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:34,338
that the store had on hand for staff and

992
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,659
one of their charges if I remember

993
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:40,130
correctly is those food items yeah we'll

994
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:44,539
get that's an article so we'll get to

995
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,430
that yeah but you do eat just listeners

996
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:48,590
think about this was the last time you

997
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:52,460
shared a candy bar with

998
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:55,160
coworker like pass that [ __ ] around my

999
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,949
times have you been in a place yeah okay

1000
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,779
think about that the officer's name in

1001
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:01,339
the OSI da announcement has facing petty

1002
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,590
theft charges for eating the supposedly

1003
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,289
non pot laced candy bars okay I want to

1004
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,150
stop don't say it laced if you put it in

1005
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:11,119
there on purpose and it's being sold as

1006
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,769
waste is hiding it like a place is when

1007
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,269
you put some when you take a joint you

1008
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,440
put some special sprinkles in there and

1009
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,670
you don't tell somebody and they smoke

1010
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,599
it like y'all [ __ ] up that's laced

1011
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,630
infused is what we're doing here we're

1012
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:27,369
purposely writing only happens in crazy

1013
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:29,630
people's minds like it's mostly a myth

1014
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:32,420
most it's definitely not what

1015
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,730
dispensaries do to get their customers

1016
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,130
stopped right lasing doesn't happen in a

1017
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,039
dispensary so non pot infused candy bars

1018
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,660
the let's see the officer's name in the

1019
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,550
OCD announcement is facing petty theft

1020
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:45,500

pot infused candy bars our Brandon

1022
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,960
Matthew do we want to read all their

1023
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,030
names I don't want to glorify them by

1024
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,010
reading their names another officer also

1025
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,019
faces an additional count of vandalism

1026
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,180
for damaging the disabled video cameras

1027
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:58,579
and allegedly smashing their lenses into

1028
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:02,029
the corner of a display case and cash

1029
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:03,920
register I guess an extra dick let's go

1030
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,510
he gets an extra charge the three

1031
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,309
defendants are accused of consuming the

1032
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,800
food items and sharing the protein bars

1033
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:11,750
with other SAPD personnel the press

1034
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,370
release states before leaving the

1035
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,559
premises at the conclusion of the search

1036
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,150
warrant to officers I can't even say one

1037
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,309
of their names are accused of taking

1038
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,750
extra cookies with them the DA's office

1039
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:22,519
says it concluded a thorough

1040
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,590
investigation of the incident including

1041
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,420
the careful review of more than 16 hours

1042
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,140
of unedited video surveillance footage

1043
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:32,570
with cooperation of the SAPD

1044
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:34,429
while other SAPD personnel like the bald

1045
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,800
cop seen in the video saying he felt

1046
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:43,099
lightheaded after eating one of them ate

1047
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,990
some protein bars there is unsubstantial

1048
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:46,940
evidence that they knew the food items

1049
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:48,469
belonged to the dispensary and not their

1050
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,079
fellow officers that release states

1051
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:53,059
there is also no evidence that any SAPD

1052
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,920
personnel consumed any edible marijuana

1053
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,920
items available at the dispensary

1054
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,500
they expect us to believe this [ __ ] well

1055
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,119
the article even says right no evidence

1056
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,858
whatsoever other than the fact that the

1057
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,710
cops were at a pot shop eating candy

1058
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:10,239
bars enacting hi one is the one is then

1059
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,009
left with the obvious conclusion that

1060
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,048
these poor officers are so underpaid

1061
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:16,210
that they have no choice but to munch

1062
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:18,759
down on pilfered protein bars while on

1063
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,358
duty that makes so much more sense right

1064
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:22,608
leg

1065
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:25,998
they broke in they smashed everything

1066
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:29,598
and they they were like Oh Chaz brought

1067
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:31,429
cookies like to their military-style

1068
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,109
raid like you've seen the video they

1069
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:35,989
jump out of their SWAT car and their

1070
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:37,518
SWAT gear they [ __ ] bang open an

1071
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:39,440
unlocked [ __ ] door by kicking it the

1072
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:41,149
wrong way a bunch um

1073
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,309
screaming yell at everybody and they're

1074
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,960
like what the dude in the back had

1075
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:49,369
cookies are you like how little

1076
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,619
attention do they think we're paying

1077
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:53,450
they sit there in the video and talk

1078
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:57,230
about how they're all woozy from eating

1079
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:58,998
the protein bars they stole like what do

1080
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,498
you see the video and then you look at

1081
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:02,509
these charges and it's like okay the

1082
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:05,568
rest of that was just legal common

1083
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:07,278
procedure like how is that common well

1084
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:09,588
it also says if convicted on all counts

1085
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:11,900
the trio of uninformed snack fiends

1086
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:15,558
faces between six months and one year in

1087
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:17,480
jail plus fines so if they do get if

1088
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,430
they do go to court they do get a jury

1089
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,498
the jury is gonna watch this video and

1090
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:24,548
convict them if they get real people on

1091
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:28,429
the jury if they don't [ __ ] right if

1092
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:31,068
I kind of want to see what happens to

1093
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:33,078
these guys if they go to jail nothing

1094
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:34,969
good cops don't do well in jail I

1095
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,950
haven't been there I don't know but I

1096
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,808
could I've seen plenty of movies to know

1097
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:40,998
that cops are not gonna do well in you

1098
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:43,009
know the behavior so egregious and we've

1099
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:46,399
seen it for so long in this community

1100
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:48,829
there's a raid for a dispensary or

1101
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,200
whatnot and they come back the day after

1102
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:54,048
the raid with video cameras and

1103
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:56,210
everything's broken like everything

1104
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:58,998
everything the walls the lights the

1105
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,179
lightbulbs the doorknobs everything's

1106
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:04,818
destroyed the carpets ripped up

1107
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:06,739
electrical wiring is destroyed and it's

1108
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:08,838
like well this you were serving a search

1109
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,608
warrant it's just a display of

1110
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,259
aggression you just came in destroyed

1111
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:14,358
everything about you didn't even arrest

1112
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,710
anybody no charges were filed you just

1113
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,028
came in took everything destroyed

1114
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,630
everything he didn't that isn't worth

1115
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:22,989
taking and left like that's not why law

1116
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:28,240
enforcement that's piracy

1117
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:29,739
it's terrorism it's insane and most of

1118
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,039
the public school with it cuz they're

1119
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:35,739
doing it to the stoners the stoners that

1120
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,779
worked hard to open a business and to

1121
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,489
help in pay tribute thank God it hasn't

1122
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,519
been a lot of this these raids in

1123
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:45,039
Colorado but I see them regularly in

1124
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,210
other states where a business is

1125
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:52,210
invested years millions of dollars to

1126
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,940
get up running start getting successful

1127
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,530
and then the cops come in destroy

1128
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,440
everything take everything worth money

1129
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,510
and bounce in a year later no one's been

1130
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,588
charged with anything and the store is

1131
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,410
back up and running again

1132
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:06,699
yep I mean from my perspective that's

1133
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,920
why they don't want us to use banks

1134
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:10,719
because there's more paperwork to seize

1135
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,599
a bank account than to just snatch the

1136
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,379
saves I hadn't thought about it that way

1137
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,970
that sucks

1138
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,349
yeah yeah that sounds accurate there's

1139
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:18,669
more cash in there they just gonna get

1140
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:20,740
it and buy themselves more armored

1141
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,530
vehicles and Humvees right design us so

1142
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:25,209
the trend this is the podcast I guess so

1143
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,589
I agree with you I might support your

1144
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,710
statements my friend is why I bring you

1145
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:32,349

1146
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,659
don't mind waiting for hours in line to

1147
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:36,280
vote it's because I started paying

1148
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:38,949
attention and the more I paid attention

1149
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,150
the more calm my attention and the more

1150
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:42,149
I saw the more pissed I got

1151

I love you bro also I have a an email

1247
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:55,500
from a friend I talked about dosage on

1248
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:57,618
the podcast of edibles

1249
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,389
and apparently I recommended too much

1250
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:02,340
because this guy said that his

1251
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:04,409
girlfriend was nearly dripping from the

1252
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,200
dosage that I recommended do you

1253
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:09,480
remember what you recommend no no I

1254
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,189
don't but I think we're supposed to

1255
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,179
recommend five or ten milligrams I think

1256
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:17,760
I said 25 I think I said 25 um yeah I

1257
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:20,339
hear a lot of people recommends they

1258
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,070
tell people oh you've been smoking flour

1259
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:26,820
for years you want to start with 10 or

1260
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:29,760
20 or 30 or 40 and I say that's nuts

1261
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:32,460
start with 10 work your way up slow it

1262
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,520

guy did somebody and made them eat too

1279
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,980
much THC the correct dosage if you're

1280
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:15,449
gonna consume edibles and it's your

1281
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,760
first time in you're a noob you should

1282
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:19,500
probably stick with 10 milligrams to

1283
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,810
start wait about an hour if you don't

1284
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,920
feel anything wait another hour and eat

1285
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:27,029
10 more her do you think we should tell

1286
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:30,059
him to eat Oh eat one 10 wait 2 hours 2

1287
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:31,470
hours alright after two hours of had

1288
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,059
time for stomachs break it down

1289
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:36,118
processing through your liver and get it

1290
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:38,130
into your blood don't eat more before

1291
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,410
that first windows up if that window

1292
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,869
hits and you never felt anything go

1293
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:44,909
ahead and step your dose up but

1294
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:46,858
something should a kick or eight kick

1295
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:49,259
day and you just might not never gonna

1296

say something I want to mention is often

1297
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,380
times I'll eat some edibles as I'm

1298
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,730
getting ready to go somewhere to go use

1299
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,500
edibles aren't even working what the

1300
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,300
[ __ ] is going on and then you get

1301
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,510
wherever you're going and you're like oh

1302
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,619
man edibles are working so sometimes you

1303
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,869
got to get out of the house you got to

1304
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,480
go for a walk you gotta just take to the

1305
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,880
store

1306
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,829
but also I feel like when I'm here oh

1307
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,150
this is my comfort zone right here I got

1308
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,960
the computer in front of me the mixing

1309

00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,710
right here there's a couch right there I

1313
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,169

1314
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,970
feet I'm cool right here I don't feel

1315
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,769
like I get as high here I could smoke a

1316
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:25,480
gram of hash right here and be okay but

1317
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:27,730
if I smoked the same gram at your house

1318
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:31,750
how would be three times as high and a

1319
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:33,789
little uncomfortable environments like

1350
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:52,989
experience about my third edible that I

1351
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:55,600
consumed was a Dixie elixirs 75

1352

milligrams soda the drinks a drink and

1353
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,250
it was come on wrong and it was really

1354
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:02,230
way too heavy and I had like about a

1355
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,090
four-hour panic attack Wow

1356
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:07,090
and now this is you know being a daily

1357
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:09,280
smoker for over 15 years yeah and at

1358
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:11,230
that point I'd been dabbing daily for

1359
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,990
about three or four months

1360
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,969
so I was not a novice in any way plenty

1361
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:17,858
of THC honey vyx perience holy crap oh

1362
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:20,250
yeah edibles are really strange and like

1363
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:23,078
when I first started doing edibles

1364
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:26,559
sometimes and those like so the first

1365
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:30,940
five attempts it would take like six to

1366
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:33,400
eight hours to kick in oh wow yeah well

1367
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:36,599
slow metabolism yeah so it really varies

1368
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,010
depending on the person they hit me

1369
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,079
swallow a damn edible and feel it coming

1370
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,390
on yeah oh [ __ ] if it's more than 30

1371
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:46,990
minutes it's it's [ __ ] I'm taking it

1372
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:47,650
back because I mean they come on right

1373
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:49,598

1374
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,309
and I'm about it 100 milligrams it's

1375
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,650
where I need to be for a dose okay and

1376
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:58,420
that's that's very effective for me but

1377
00:56:53,650 --> 00:57:01,000
now I take that to go to bed I have a

1378
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:03,309
you know an edible at night to go to bed

1379
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,559

bedtime do comes out an hour okay

1381
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:14,170

Denver that the people going to the ER

1383

1384
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:22,659
predominantly from out of state

1385
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:38,559

just don't know what to do anymore also

1392
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,730
you know when I lived in Texas because

1393
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:57,929
of price constraints I was about a gram

1394
00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:05,619
a day smoker right and flowers are happy

1395

touchin that plug ya know anyway um it

1399
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:19,328
was just more of a cost thing you know

1400
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:21,309
cuz it's [ __ ] expensive oh yeah so

1401
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,720
you have to you know you have to budget

1402
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:25,059
so I was you know I've smoked about a

1403
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,189
gram of flowers a day and when I could

1404
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:28,599
get concentrates I would get him but

1405
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,150
there were few and far between never

1406
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:33,039
very expensive I would say like 60 bucks

1407
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:37,150
an eighth isn't isn't it like a grandma

1408
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:38,349
concentrate a felony in Texas okay this

1409
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:57,579
table right here we could all go to

1410
00:58:38,349 --> 00:59:00,579
prison but you know you know the quality

1411
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:03,909
also varied a lot with that week was the

1412
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:05,679
legal state so my you know the levels of

1413
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:07,210
THC I had my body then were not what

1414
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,980
they are now and if you're coming from

1415
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,389
out of state here especially from a

1416
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,860
state where it's still illegal right

1417
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:13,629
you're not a medical user

1418
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:16,809
yeah edibles are a whole different world

1419
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,579
they sell a 350 milligram aníbal and

1420
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:21,789
it's a tiny little thing I think that's

1421
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:24,690
a little dangerous I hate that on a

1422
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:27,159
podcast and if I didn't have this chair

1423
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:29,079
this chair and computer and table or all

1424
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:32,129
that kept me on this planet so Larry's

1425
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:34,029
these people got to realize that it's

1426
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:35,769
edibles are a different kind of high

1427
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,720
it's not like smoking like it's it's

1428
00:59:35,769 --> 00:59:39,159
real easy to notice you've had enough

1429
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:40,049
and stop hitting the joint as it goes

1430
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:44,980
around the circle

1431
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:46,870
you can't honey drugs I say that once

1432
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,610
once you decide that you're gonna eat it

1433
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:50,309
you're on that roller coaster and so it

1434
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:52,510
comes to a complete snap

1435
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:54,329
there's no eject button in the middle

1436
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:56,590
and you just have to ride it out like

1437
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:58,329
unfortunately you really care like

1438
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:01,059
you're gonna wake up tomorrow yeah

1439
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:04,068
you're gonna be fine as long as you

1440
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:07,420
don't don't call your mom yeah

1441
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:10,599
your mom don't call the cops don't call

1442
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,599
the cops

01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:27,410
all right so we've corrected that issue

1445
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:28,699
once again I apologize I keep saying

1446
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:30,139
that but I feel bad if somebody did

1447
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:31,639
wreck themselves I'm an [ __ ] that's

1448

1563
01:05:53,739 --> 01:06:00,250

1614
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:55,900
in there they've got highly educated

1615
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,949
titanium products they've got a product

1616
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,019
in there I can't believe I didn't buy

1617
01:07:56,949 --> 01:08:01,389
while I was there they've got the highly

1618
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:02,980
educated nail with the ceramic bit or

1619
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:04,960
not ceramic with the quartz dish on top

1620
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,730
so you got the titanium base with the

1621
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,889
Cork's edition

1622
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:10,500
pretty much indestructible if you take

1623
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:11,969
care of it go get that that's a badass

1624
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,369
piece but anyway shines through those

1625
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:16,710
places I support them I recommend them

1626
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:18,659
if you're in Colorado Springs also one

1627
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,609
more big important message I've been

1628
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:23,220
advertising the secret session on 4/20

1629
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:25,950
change plans secret session is now on

1630
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:27,750
421 because of some logistics in the

1631
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:29,250
city of Denver and things that go on

1632
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,020
when they're trying to plan a cannabis

1633
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,850
event and people try to be [ __ ]

1634
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,640
but secret session on 4/20 one make sure

1635
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:37,588
you support that email me for more

1636
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,569

1637
01:08:37,588 --> 01:08:41,699
secret session Colorado on Instagram

1638
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:43,440
check that out I think that's all of the

1639
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:44,729
advertising and butt-kissing I've got to

1640
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,889
do for the start of the show and now we

1641
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:49,979
can get into the topics that I've

1642
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:51,329
invited these young men here for it's

1643
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:52,409
like a steel cage match we just looked

1644
01:08:51,329 --> 01:09:02,460
at both these guys like I was about to

1645
01:08:52,409 --> 01:09:04,470
ask him if they're ready to fight so the

1646
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,449
reason that these guys wanted to get

1647
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:08,069
they actually both messaged me wanting

1648
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:10,889
to do a podcast on this topic so I love

1649
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:14,520
the initiative thank you guys yeah our

1650
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:15,660
local anti cannabis groups is it one

1651
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,750
group over there multiple groups

1652
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:20,880
involved in this [ __ ] there might be

1653
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:26,488
a second group now it could just be the

1654
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:28,289
first group using a new name okay they

1655
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:29,608
don't get any more pointless most other

1656
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,229
people want to go troll them do you want

1657
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:33,180
to mention them so that maybe perhaps

1658
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:35,488
people and I I couldn't ask our

1659
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:37,380
listeners to go and troll these people

1660
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:40,349
and say creation on their page but if

1661
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,029
they did I couldn't stop them or better

1662
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:46,048
yet just go correct their nonsense

1663
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:47,549
lately and watch them stew and freak out

1664
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,140
on you because it makes them look even

1665
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:51,390
worse and they can't figure out what to

1666
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,520
say it's really funny how research and

1667
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:55,890
all but I think we'll just give them an

1668
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,750
easy way to find them let's go to your

1669

1683
01:10:21,828 --> 01:10:28,130
insanely busy it's good for you busy

1684
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:30,289
alright so let's talk about uh this

1685
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,449
local group here is trying to close all

1686
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:33,649
of the recreational cannabis and they

1687
01:10:32,448 --> 01:10:35,868
doing just record they want to do much

1688
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:38,960
well they want it all gone

1689
01:10:35,868 --> 01:10:42,039
and if you head over to their page at

1690
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:45,889
all and look through their post history

1691
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:48,920
medicals a sham it's all a joke and a

1692
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:51,559
scam and a con to make money on the

1693
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,828
backs of our children and they want it

1694
01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:57,260
all gone but right now they're just

1695
01:10:54,828 --> 01:10:59,569
focused on getting rid of the rec

1696
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:01,900
industry so recreational stores

1697
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:05,539
production facilities manufacturers

1698
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:10,189
grows testing labs all of it they want

1699
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:12,469
it gone yep because because it's bad

1700
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:16,578
yeah that's the only reason I could find

1701
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:19,219
on there because drugs are bad okay the

1702
01:11:16,578 --> 01:11:22,759
one article that kind of got into a

1703
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:25,158
little bit of their reasons they don't

1704
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,980
like that there are more homeless people

1705
01:11:25,158 --> 01:11:29,750
in the city than there were before they

1706
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:33,618
seem to think the crime problem in the

1707
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:38,630
city is new and somehow cannabis shops

1708
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:42,139
in the county related and they there's

1709
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:44,569
another one the tax that the tax

1710
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:49,039
proceeds that come in are really really

1711
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:51,349
really well reported and they're pretty

1712
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,809
sure that if they get rid of the taxes

1713
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:55,460
then no one in government will have a

1714
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,809
reason to continue to support the

1715
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:59,599
marijuana industry and they'll be able

1716
01:11:56,809 --> 01:12:02,630
to give her the rest of it like it

1717
01:11:59,599 --> 01:12:06,559
doesn't make a lot of sense and most of

1718
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:08,420
their issues are with home grows and

1719
01:12:06,559 --> 01:12:10,070
they're not gonna get rid of any home

1720
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:12,859
groceries clothes or rid of the stores

1721
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:14,779
they're gonna produce right get more of

1722
01:12:12,859 --> 01:12:16,609
them yeah absolutely

1723
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:19,250
and it'll cater to the black market all

1724
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:20,960
over again right go ahead Gary well we

1725
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,869
should talk about home grows because

1726
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,630
there's been a big

1727
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:28,349
push on home gross lately everywhere

1728
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:29,369
multiple raids in Denver down here part

1729
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:34,320
County

1730
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:37,130
Montrose 17 raids since March first and

1731
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:41,479
I'm aware of there in the in the state

1732
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:44,670
and a major major gross it's a bigger

1733
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:49,079
triangle and you're not an incredibly

1734
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:51,840
well known medical patient and caregiver

1735
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:56,939
that's registered and active in their

1736
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:59,520
local politics and stuff and have your

1737
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:01,439
plant kill in order your local and

1738
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,360
county ordinances because a lot of the

1739
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,949
cities and counties are passing limiting

1740
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,689
plant limiting blackouts while you're

1741
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:09,539
asleep they're doing it in private

1742
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:11,339
sessions while you're asleep to a no a

1743
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:12,689
new plant count and they're just out in

1744
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,529
your backyard cutting down your plants

1745
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:16,829
because you're out of compliance

1746
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:20,279
overnight they uh most of it around

1747
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:22,199
Colorado's complaint driven there were a

1748
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:25,649
couple of well-publicized bus down here

1749
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:27,720
in Pueblo one of them was because the

1750
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:29,099
neighbor complained about some [ __ ] that

1751
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,920
most neighbors would have complained

1752
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:34,590
about and then the other one they got

1753
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:43,710
busted in Florida with a carful weed

1754
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:45,300
Texas but the interesting part about

1755
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:47,279
both of those is that was people from

1756
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,659
far away trying to grow weed here and

1757
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,479
take it somewhere else well and also

1758
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:54,300
they were like like the got the the

1759
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:57,059
biggest bus with five grow houses right

1760
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,369
in Puebla West and everybody involved

1761
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:02,690
twelve people had all been in Colorado

1762
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:04,949
less than sixty days right there people

1763
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:07,289
that's a problem they don't know any

1764
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:08,699
part of the rules exactly they think

1765
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:10,350
they can do whatever they want they

1766
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:13,079
don't even know what hide they're not

1767
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:15,650
even well informed that's right

1768
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:18,420
it's just really sloppy and stupid

1769
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:19,199
absolutely but it makes the rest of us

1770
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,909
look bad

1771
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,519
you know it's my point there and you

1772
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:27,899
know there's there is an effort right

1773
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:30,210
now from the regulatory bodies right and

1774
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:32,039
we're seeing it you know like Mike was

1775
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:36,000
pointing out earlier the regulations

1776
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:39,149
change abruptly frequently and you know

1777
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,569
you have to really stay on top and it's

1778
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:44,670
it's almost like they are attempting to

1779
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:46,979
trip people the license holders up so

1780
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:48,659
that they can find them or pull their

1781
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:50,519
license now if they have their funds you

1782
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:53,699
know what I mean those license yeah I

1783
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:56,010
don't really say that but a lot of the

1784
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:59,010
rules aren't passed with how they'll be

1785
01:14:56,010 --> 01:15:00,239
implemented in exactly and so when

1786
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:02,670
they're writing the law they picking

1787
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,130
okay it's gonna pass today let's give

1788
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:07,199
them six months from them today to get

1789
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,340
it to get any compliance and sometimes

1790
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,380
they're talking about like major

1791
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:12,900
construction issues are you guys dealing

1792
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,539
with the new packaging rules at the spot

1793
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:20,069
yeah everybody it's so stupid isn't it

1794
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:22,170
so sorry just recently happened in a

1795
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:23,609
media tracking system every time I loose

1796
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:25,440
flour I've got to give you a small

1797
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:32,339
pamphlet full of information basically

1798
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:36,899
so number at the end of the day yeah

1799
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,579
it's uh the tracking is nuts like if you

1800
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:41,909
think you can move here from from

1801
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:43,289
another state grow weed here easily and

1802
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:46,349
then ship it back you're [ __ ] nuts

1803
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:48,960
yeah they're looking for that they're

1804
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:52,260
looking for that and be the neighbors

1805
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:55,739
are like we your local paper hasn't

1806
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:57,989
reported on the hundreds of hours in

1807
01:15:55,739 --> 01:16:00,899
City Council meetings that people have

1808
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:02,819
spent arguing zoning rules you haven't

1809
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:06,239
seen the hundreds of news articles about

1810
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:09,210
them every day in your local paper you

1811
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:10,949
just get the major news bulletins and so

1812
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:13,409
the rest of us know okay you can't have

1813
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:14,909
600 plants in your backyard that guy's

1814
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:17,609
probably breaking the last nobody's

1815
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:19,710
gonna call the cops on him don't go over

1816
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:21,960
there for a while what I understand that

1817
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:26,579
this movement to make Pueblo is too

1818
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,560
city is related somehow to the anti

1819
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:30,329
cannabis snuff that if they can get

1820
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,980
incorporated as a city they can get rid

1821
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:33,449
of it too they then put you in the

1822
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:35,519
municipal rule you're not under the

1823
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:38,069
county rule anymore there's some I think

1824
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,110
that's their plan B what I understand

1825
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:43,199
there's a couple of possible Plan B's

1826
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:44,699
how many people if if the cannabis

1827
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,829
business were shut down if I said right

1828
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:49,170
now no more cannabis business in Pueblo

1829
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:52,229
ass no more recreational cannabis how

1830
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:54,750
many jobs would be lost immediately it

1831
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:57,149
would be somewhere between 700,000

1832
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:59,819
people that's badged employees working

1833
01:16:57,149 --> 01:17:01,649
it stores grows production facilities

1834
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:05,399
edible companies and then there's gonna

1835
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:10,619
be there's everybody else the

1836
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:14,369
accountants the lawyers the security

1837
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:16,500
companies this contractors is gonna

1838
01:17:14,369 --> 01:17:18,449
start losing money for sure well grow

1839
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:28,979
they might do better because more home

1840
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:30,539
growers are gonna spring throw a lot of

1841
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:33,479
stuff in disarray so I can be good for

1842
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:35,279
anybody it takes more than two vehicles

1843
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,429
to load up our soil order when we go buy

1844
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:41,399
soil at the shop I mean can't take a hit

1845
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:46,200
like that right now for a thousand

1846
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:48,569
people to be out of work overnight the

1847
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:52,829
demographic that is employed in most of

1848
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:55,909
these facilities are 25 to 35 to 40 year

1849
01:17:52,829 --> 01:17:58,559
old folks right now and there's no job

1850
01:17:55,909 --> 01:18:05,550
used to living off those bud tender tips

1851
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:07,650
and [ __ ] like that do that recently a

1852
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:09,150
friend of ours who lost his job decided

1853
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,619
to not be involved in the cannabis

1854
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:12,420
industry tried to go get a job at a bank

1855
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:18,119
and he has to try to figure out how to

1856
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:20,340
make that adjustment would take just

1857
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:23,369
with those jobs is bad but when you

1858
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,079
consider that secondary supporting ring

1859
01:18:23,369 --> 01:18:27,329
I mean there's a hundred other

1860
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:29,909
industries that you need to run a

1861
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:31,260
dispensary in the tax bow I don't have

1862
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:33,840
the article on my computer screen but I

1863
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,360
should mention the part about the the

1864
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,069
scholarships

1865
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:40,078
five million dollars out of the county

1866
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:41,988
budget next year if the like that's what

1867
01:18:40,078 --> 01:18:47,238
they're projected to make this year so

1868
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:50,669
in November elections if this passes

1869
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:53,638
next year we might collect three and a

1870
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:56,149
half million before October when this

1871
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:58,980
rule would kick in but then that's it

1872
01:18:56,149 --> 01:19:00,448
and so there's five million dollars for

1873
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:02,069
the stuff in the county budget we've

1874
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:04,078
slated to do with this money

1875
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:08,269
like 1.3 million of it's going to the

1876
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:12,868
state fair to fix up the AG building

1877
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:14,969
there's another 700,000 going for

1878
01:19:12,868 --> 01:19:18,089
college scholarships here in Pueblo the

1879
01:19:14,969 --> 01:19:19,679
local call high school kids that are

1880
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,819
getting ready to graduate right now if

1881
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,250
they want to go to one of the two

1882
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:25,948
colleges down here in Pueblo they can

1883
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:27,179
apply for a marijuana scholarship and

1884
01:19:25,948 --> 01:19:29,069
all of that money is coming from

1885
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,210
marijuana taxes so we're sending kids to

1886
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:36,658
college with this money

1887
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:39,840
hashtag marijuana scholarship West where

1888
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:42,569
it's just like the road there's no

1889
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,309
sidewalk or gutter or anything that the

1890
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,779
kids walk on from their neighborhood to

1891
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:49,320
the school every day and it's like crazy

1892
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:51,149
unsafe um cuz the bus is that kids from

1893
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:52,799
a little further out or riding on or

1894
01:19:51,149 --> 01:19:54,149
traveling on this street - they're

1895
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,829
putting sidewalks in there with this

1896
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:58,319
money like we're doing [ __ ] that that

1897
01:19:55,828 --> 01:20:00,448
should have been done forever ago that

1898
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,399
we couldn't afford to do and we're gonna

1899
01:20:00,448 --> 01:20:06,479
stop five million dollars worth of that

1900
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:09,149
um just overnight add maybe after this

1901
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:11,578
November's election it's crazy to think

1902
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:14,819
about so there's a lot of people fired

1903
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:17,609
up info right now over this it's it

1904
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:19,889
would be ridiculous to put that many tax

1905
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:21,359
dollars in the in the toilet and flush

1906
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:22,828
it down and put that many people out of

1907
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,960
more employment it would be stupid I

1908
01:20:22,828 --> 01:20:26,759
think well for something that's not

1909
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,529
causing any problems particularly when

1910
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,119
you think about you know marijuana was

1911
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:32,429
here before it was legal and it's gonna

1912
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:34,500
be here after it's you know even if they

1913
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:37,139
passed this it's not going anywhere

1914
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,479
right and just all the benefits are

1915
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:41,340
going away the problems are gonna

1916
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,019
compound the growers that lose their

1917
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,059
jobs if the dispensaries are gonna go

1918
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:47,340
for the black market the [ __ ]

1919
01:20:45,059 --> 01:20:48,719
not pay taxes on it have people come in

1920
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,400
and go into their residence create more

1921
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,319
traffic in your residence have an

1922
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,819
illegal grow in next door to your house

1923
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,259
have people come in to buy herb next

1924
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:58,349
door to your house well that's what

1925
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,539
Kamiya is really bizarre about this this

1926
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:02,730
effort to shut down the rec industry is

1927
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:07,889
that's where the benefits come from

1928
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:09,959
exactly they almost problem-free in the

1929
01:21:07,889 --> 01:21:14,159
entire run that pueblo is done with

1930
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,500
marijuana shops period old one license

1931
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:19,638
was rescinded kind of automatically and

1932
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:22,828
then another license was the first

1933
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:25,380
dispensary in Colorado period to get

1934
01:21:22,828 --> 01:21:27,929
shut down for regulatory infractions not

1935
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,909
law violations or major rule breaking

1936
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:31,199
they just the regulations change they

1937
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:35,969
couldn't meet them fast enough they got

1938
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:38,428
in trouble but that's been it like we

1939
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:40,408
don't cause crime we don't have stuff

1940
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:42,840
going out the backdoor to some other

1941
01:21:40,408 --> 01:21:44,549
place or state we don't have teenagers

1942
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,050
shopping there like everybody down here

1943
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,489
in the legal industry follows the rules

1944
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:50,400
because we all want to be open next

1945
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:52,109
month I mean any small violation of the

1946
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,149
rules can cost you license is just that

1947
01:21:52,109 --> 01:21:56,130
simple that's why you don't see big

1948
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:58,679
dispensaries screwing up in any major

1949
01:21:56,130 --> 01:22:01,380
ways it's because it's too expensive to

1950
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,118
risk screwing up yeah so you end up

1951
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,650
hiring three or four people to just run

1952
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:09,359
around all day and make sure everybody's

1953
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:11,219
complying with the rules most of the

1954
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:15,598
problems these people have with legal

1955
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:18,300
marijuana have to do with every other

1956
01:22:15,599 --> 01:22:21,328
part of marijuana being legal home grows

1957
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:24,900
where people can consume how people can

1958
01:22:21,328 --> 01:22:27,090
consume the variety of edible products

1959
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:29,158
access to teenagers like none of that

1960
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,020
[ __ ] it changes if you get rid of rec it

1961
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:33,960
all gets worse every bit of it gets work

1962
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:36,420
yes the county shops are doing like 1.7

1963
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,309
to 2.5 million in sales every year you

1964
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:40,770
figure half that's tourists so you still

1965
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:44,449
got a milot of half going back into the

1966
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:46,619
ghetto like that's not a good thing like

1967
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:48,689
you don't want all of that business

1968
01:22:46,618 --> 01:22:51,808
taking place in the house at the street

1969
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:53,339
because those are the ones that bad

1970
01:22:51,809 --> 01:22:55,139
people with shotguns show up and try to

1971
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,610
rob hotels are gonna lose money

1972
01:22:55,139 --> 01:22:57,469
restaurants are gonna lose money the

1973
01:22:56,609 --> 01:22:59,118
movie theater

1974
01:22:57,469 --> 01:23:00,920
money yeah that's the other half of that

1975
01:22:59,118 --> 01:23:02,478
money as all the people coming here for

1976
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:08,090
vacation now we were a spring break

1977
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:10,729
destination yeah a bunch of people in

1978
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:14,380
town for spring break a lot of people

1979
01:23:10,729 --> 01:23:16,849
came to town for spring break this yeah

1980
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:19,519
you know and the thing is if they would

1981
01:23:16,849 --> 01:23:22,069
turn a little different and promote that

1982
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:24,199
and cultivate that then that could be

1983
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:25,849
huge next year you know what I mean and

1984
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:27,768
massive amount of tax dollars right

1985
01:23:25,849 --> 01:23:29,300
massive amount Tom yeah what do they

1986
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:33,710
make a year out there in Pueblo West in

1987
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:35,269
cannabis taxes last year it was like 1.7

1988
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:37,998
million this next year it's gonna be

1989
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:41,619
five mainly because there's a new 3.5%

1990
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:44,590
tax on the production so an excise tax

1991
01:23:41,619 --> 01:23:47,868
[Music]

1992
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:50,389
no yeah there's a huge expansion and

1993
01:23:47,868 --> 01:23:52,518
then the we didn't have a special excise

1994
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:55,340
tax just a special sales tax do you know

1995
01:23:52,519 --> 01:23:58,099
by any random chance what Pueblo West's

1996
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:01,369
other tax income is like what are they

1997
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:03,170
bring in other than what's the number do

1998
01:24:01,368 --> 01:24:05,538
you know their number - cannabis taxes

1999
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:18,349
will know the marijuana taxes represent

2000
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:19,998
like - okay an overall percentage it

2001
01:24:18,349 --> 01:24:22,038
seems small but when you look at the

2002
01:24:19,998 --> 01:24:24,109
list of stuff that like we can't pay

2003
01:24:22,038 --> 01:24:29,988
cops right now like there isn't an extra

2004
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:31,998
1% right it's not so much extra at this

2005
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:33,439
point because lights in the West it's

2006
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:33,948
the darkest [ __ ] city I've ever

2007
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:36,408
driven

2008
01:24:33,948 --> 01:24:40,308
they budgeted for it because it's gonna

2009
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:43,518
come in this year and so funding got

2010
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:45,349
moved around and when the five million

2011
01:24:43,519 --> 01:24:48,139
for marijuana like if that doesn't come

2012
01:24:45,349 --> 01:24:50,300
in because of this vote all kinds of

2013
01:24:48,139 --> 01:24:52,400
stuff isn't gonna happen the year after

2014
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,219
that because of those cuts it'll start

2015
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,439
to look like Detroit in a few years

2016
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:58,939
like you really can't webelo definitely

2017
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:01,669
can't afford to lose that kind of jobs

2018
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:03,919
you see major articles in the chieftain

2019
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:06,769
when the steel mill lays off 200 people

2020
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,630
temporarily because the impact that the

2021
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,510
city feels when that happens is major

2022
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:12,819
that's 200 paychecks

2023
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:15,310
um with a thousand people say it's only

2024
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:17,829
700 if 700 people stopped bringing home

2025
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:21,520
paychecks because of this bow like that

2026
01:25:17,829 --> 01:25:23,920
700 fewer people that can order dinner I

2027
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,840
have pizza delivered go to the movies go

2028
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,340
get another pair of sneakers go get

2029
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,710
their kids school supplies take their

2030
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:31,029
car all of that stuff it's 700 people

2031
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:33,489
that are gonna be applying for food

2032
01:25:31,029 --> 01:25:36,369
stamps yep it's 700 people that are only

2033
01:25:33,489 --> 01:25:40,300
going to food unemployment food pantries

2034
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:42,609
it's 700 more stresses on an already

2035
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,940
overtaxed system of support yep in this

2036
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:47,799
community in a small community

2037
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:49,869
yeah it's is literally like 1 percent of

2038
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,489
the people in public County like there's

2039
01:25:49,869 --> 01:25:52,869
a hundred and thirty-some thousand

2040
01:25:51,489 --> 01:25:55,149
people down here so it's like the worst

2041
01:25:52,869 --> 01:26:01,210
type of self sabotage yeah immediately

2042
01:25:55,149 --> 01:26:02,949
can't take it really is no it's it's you

2043
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:04,480
know the reason I wanted to have this

2044
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,840
podcast the reason I wanted to talk

2045
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:11,609
about this issue is I want everybody who

2046
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:15,789
supports cannabis to take it seriously

2047
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:18,399
because from my perspective on social

2048
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:20,560
media and out in the community nobody's

2049
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:22,869
really taking it seriously and that's

2050
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,850
that frightens me to be honest I don't

2051
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:27,250
think anybody took the idea that they

2052
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:29,079
could shut down cannabis in Pueblo West

2053
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,939
seriously it doesn't seem like something

2054
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:33,430
feasible oh they can't do that we voted

2055
01:26:30,939 --> 01:26:36,629
voted it in is what a lot of people say

2056
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:39,240
and they just the ballot nobody shows up

2057
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:42,279
[Music]

2058
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:45,489
it's it's a weird election to run this

2059
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:47,949
in it's the anti-pot people tend to be

2060
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:50,800
more conservative we just had a

2061
01:26:47,949 --> 01:26:54,670
Democratic president for eight years no

2062
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:56,650
no no stretch in American history have

2063
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:59,140
we had a two-term president from one

2064
01:26:56,649 --> 01:27:03,009
party or another followed by a president

2065
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:05,020
from that same party so history tells us

2066
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:07,570
that more conservatives are going to

2067
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:10,360
turnout in this election than liberals

2068
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:13,599
to vote for president which means

2069
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:16,630
they're gonna be at the polls which

2070
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,460
means that if the useful and the pro

2071
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:21,159
cannabis vote don't come out and force

2072
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:23,859
this November it's the legal it will

2073
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:26,590
here locally we can see the rec industry

2074
01:27:23,859 --> 01:27:28,509
shut down and a lot of us would be out

2075
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:31,150
of work and that would really suck but

2076
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,860
there's four or five states that at

2077
01:27:31,149 --> 01:27:35,500
least that are legalizing that whole big

2078
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:37,089
list we did not all of those efforts are

2079
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:40,300
gonna make the ballot but five to eight

2080
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:41,889
to ten of them are going to and if

2081
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:44,550
people don't show up and vote in those

2082
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:47,679
areas those efforts are gonna lose and

2083
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:50,710
all of the people that say or have been

2084
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:53,859
saying legalization is inevitable are

2085
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:55,300
gonna watch that tide turn and the

2086
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:56,948
pendulum is gonna swing back the other

2087
01:27:55,300 --> 01:28:00,579
way just like it typically does in

2088
01:27:56,948 --> 01:28:02,559
politics and we're gonna see states that

2089
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:05,469
have liberalized their marijuana lies

2090
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,330
start to go the other way again and we

2091
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:09,279
don't want to see that so everybody

2092
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:11,559
needs to figure out if you're registered

2093
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:14,198
to vote figure out how to vote in your

2094
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,330
area where to vote in your area and get

2095
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:17,888
on top of that and stay on top of that

2096
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:23,229
all the way through the election in

2097
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:25,510
November like just Pablo West everywhere

2098
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:27,129
everywhere it's it's important to me

2099
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:28,810
locally because I could get fired in

2100
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:30,310
November and that would really suck he's

2101
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:31,630
got a beautiful little boy that he's got

2102
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:33,940
to take care of so keep Mike employed

2103
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:36,219
I've got a nice little life going right

2104
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:38,109
now and that's well thanks in large part

2105
01:28:36,219 --> 01:28:39,789
to the recreational industry Mobile

2106
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:42,339

2107
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:45,250

2108
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,750

2109
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:50,229

2113
01:28:54,189 --> 01:28:58,928
goes away yep for two years at most

2114
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:01,779
before this is an election again when

2115
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:03,550
even fewer liberals turnout and because

2116
01:29:01,779 --> 01:29:05,710
they managed to kill rec and Pueblo

2117
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:08,980
where it was so big last year you're

2118
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:12,609
just gonna be an easier target ah truth

2119
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:15,908
and it's if we can't get unified on this

2120
01:29:12,609 --> 01:29:18,579
it could get real ugly come November and

2162
01:31:28,329 --> 01:31:32,800
classier way to say that but okay we're

2163

2165
01:31:34,949 --> 01:31:40,409
so we just got all hi you guys and Gary

2166
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:44,169
decided that somebody needs to create an

2167
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:46,359
animated series based on my likeness and

2168
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:47,619
there is a copyright on my likeness so

2169
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:49,839
you guys can't [ __ ] with this I actually

2170
01:31:47,619 --> 01:31:50,920
do have a trademark on my likeness I'm

2171
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,390
not gonna tell you the name of the

2172
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,350
company and everything but that is bad

2173
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:55,570
news so don't try to [ __ ] with my

2174
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:57,100
likeness for my name but you just told

2175
01:31:55,569 --> 01:32:00,250
me that I need to have the cartoon of

2176
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:01,660
myself and I would have the Lion of

2177
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:04,149
Judah as my sidekick

2178
01:32:01,659 --> 01:32:05,649
so it'd be Rasta Jeff and the Lion Judah

2179
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:08,229
and we'd be walking around solving

2180
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:10,239
cannabis-related mysteries and war

2181
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:11,469
crimes it would be awesome but it

2182
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,939
wouldn't be like cannabis crimes it

2183
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:25,690
would be like you know crimes against

2184
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:26,829
cannabis I guess I'm not gonna let them

2185
01:32:25,689 --> 01:32:30,159
do it if they give me some shitty

2186
01:32:26,829 --> 01:32:49,630
Jamaican accent would you want it to be

2187
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:51,189
me doing my own voice or if you want to

2188
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:53,890
produce a [ __ ] Rasta Jeff themed

2189
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:57,089
cartoon I am down as [ __ ] let's get it

2190
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:57,090
on I want to see this happen

[Music]

2194
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:19,119
number one what's our mystery I've seen

2195
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:20,329
it I'm envisioning us like is the ganja

2196
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:26,319
more obviously

2197
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:29,590
[Music]

2198
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:31,869
I was thinking more like our plants got

2199
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:37,569
stolen help us find out who took Tobin

2200
01:33:31,869 --> 01:33:39,819
you track it back fully educational and

2201
01:33:37,569 --> 01:33:56,949
do like each episode is like a crow

2202
01:33:39,819 --> 01:34:03,429
lesson you've got you've got this was

2203
01:33:56,949 --> 01:34:06,429
much more but I think it could be both

2204
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:10,600
good you should watch the Mike Tyson

2205
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:13,000
mystery you that's what I baked it wanna

2206
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:15,940
see this okay just replacing it it's

2207
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,859
great you'll like it so if he wants to

2208
01:34:15,939 --> 01:34:22,269
kind of replace the Mike Tyson mysteries

2209
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:23,859
with me and my lion Judah I want to see

2210
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:25,120
me I would like to see the fighting

2211
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:27,829
crime can I be a superhero

2212
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:29,279
can we give me do I have a superpower I

2213
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:31,449
[Music]

2214
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:40,569
could talk to play that's the thing

2215
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:44,050
about cartoons whispers I like that

2216
01:34:40,569 --> 01:34:46,269
version better you can be super high in

2217
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:50,949
the line could be a superhero right I

2218
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:52,660
don't think there'd be like a whole

2219
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:54,909
question of whether the line is real or

2220
01:34:52,659 --> 01:35:00,189
not you know what I mean so it's gonna

2221
01:34:54,909 --> 01:35:03,340
Wilfred like now so far but you know

2222
01:35:00,189 --> 01:35:05,739
he's your sidekick but you know suddenly

2223
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:09,369
he's only there on a blazed

2224
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:11,380
that's we don't ever show you smoking or

2225
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:20,619
talk about me smoking but only when I'm

2226
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:22,449
obviously hi Judah shows up I don't know

2227
01:35:20,619 --> 01:35:24,399
the answer I don't know let me go find

2228
01:35:22,449 --> 01:35:26,039
Judah and then I come back with Judah

2229
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,689
and I've got the answer but those

2230
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:30,939
elements like the 70s show element the

2231
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:33,099
Mike Tyson mysteries element and the

2232
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:34,869
Scooby Doo elements if you could you

2233
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:37,200

2234
01:35:34,869 --> 01:35:37,199

01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:11,859
investigate cannabis a little further

2246
01:36:08,949 --> 01:36:14,260
and within 90 days they will release

2247
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:18,309
their opinion on it rather they decide

2248
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:19,600
to reschedule cannabis as a schedule I

2249

have an article on the fingers I'm no

2250
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,640
good with the scheduling I get the

2251
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:26,289
numbers mixed up to reschedule cannabis

2252
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:28,690
right now is it is currently listed as a

2253
01:36:26,289 --> 01:36:30,460
schedule 1 drug meaning that for the

2254
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:32,349
purposes of federal law the drug has no

2255
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:34,270
medical value and a high potential for

2256
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:36,280
abuse and is one of the most dangerous

2257
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:38,800
drugs of all drug schedules with

2258
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:41,649
potentially severe psychological or

2259
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,440
physical dependence okay that right

2260
01:36:41,649 --> 01:36:47,259
there poses a really big problem for the

2261
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:48,460
government yes because a different

2262
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:51,130
branch of the government

2263
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:53,859
owns a patent for medical uses of

2264
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:55,989
cannabis so how can it have no medical

2265
01:36:53,859 --> 01:36:57,250
uses and you own the patent but they've

2266
01:36:55,989 --> 01:36:59,789
been comfortable with that bitter

2267
01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:02,380
Apocrypha for a really long time but

2268
01:36:59,789 --> 01:37:04,869
there's a case working its way through

2269
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:07,600
the course that is challenging that very

2270
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:09,340
issue if that one of them has basically

2271
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,579
been waiting for a decade to see this

2272
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:16,360
cacao machine so there this move is

2273
01:37:12,579 --> 01:37:19,659
ahead of it and my initial thought on

2274
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:22,119
this move was this is an establishment

2275
01:37:19,659 --> 01:37:23,590
Democrat move to take some wind out of

2276
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:26,319
Bernie Sanders

2277
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:28,029
if if they reschedule before the

2278
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,880
election

2279
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:33,130
that kind of removes a key issue for

2280
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,130
Sanders the reason we highlighted

2281
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:39,819
Sanders on this podcast

2282
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:43,569
Asuna beam as an establishment Democrat

2283
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:46,000
move its counter borough

2284
01:37:43,569 --> 01:37:47,799
I'll see I was just expecting the DEA to

2285
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,738
SWAT this don't like to have every time

2286
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:54,190
but because they've we've gotten to this

2287
01:37:50,738 --> 01:37:56,799
point in the DEA trying to reschedule it

2288
01:37:54,189 --> 01:37:58,808
before trauma and honestly I haven't

2289
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,788
kept up as much as I should have with

2290
01:37:58,809 --> 01:38:04,510
this current incarnation of it but I

2291
01:38:00,788 --> 01:38:06,550
would be surprised if that but it could

2292
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:08,230
be I don't know do you think they're

2293
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:12,059
giving up the Queen to save the king

2294
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:15,518
well look socially the tide has turned

2295
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:16,840
everybody knows that yes it's just a

2296
01:38:15,519 --> 01:38:19,059
matter of what the number of states that

2297
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,619
have legalized all of the things that

2298
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:23,380
are changing it is definitely obvious

2299
01:38:20,618 --> 01:38:26,288
we've seen the DNC the Democratic

2300
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:29,650
establishment do all kinds of [ __ ]

2301
01:38:26,288 --> 01:38:31,059
to Sanders you know what I mean it kind

2302
01:38:29,649 --> 01:38:33,399
of fits the profile I'm not trying to be

2303
01:38:31,059 --> 01:38:37,119
a conspiracy theorist I just see a

2304
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:39,759
massive political value for Hillary

2305
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:42,189
Clinton if it happens before the

2306
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,780
election there's a huge political value

2307
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:46,149
for her if it happens before the

2308
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:47,889
election and that's undeniable I can see

2309
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:50,618
that all right so whether it's

2310
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:54,670
intentional or unintentional now I agree

2311
01:38:50,618 --> 01:38:57,308
with Mike I think that in under normal

2312
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:58,868
circumstances this is just the DA's

2313
01:38:57,309 --> 01:39:01,480
gonna you know shuffle some papers

2314
01:38:58,868 --> 01:39:04,000
around and [ __ ] you this is [ __ ]

2315
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:09,908
they've literally been taken to federal

2316
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:13,840
court and lost and still they're their

2317
01:39:09,908 --> 01:39:16,089
own da la judge like when the the

2318
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:20,250
original federal medical program was

2319
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:23,319
created to citizens sued the feds won

2320
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:24,908
and then the DA law judge that overheard

2321
01:39:23,319 --> 01:39:27,130
the case recommended that the DA

2322
01:39:24,908 --> 01:39:29,500
reschedule marijuana their response was

2323
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:32,650
to basically shame them into retirement

2324
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:34,960
well but and what you have to understand

2325
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:38,229
what we all have to acknowledge here is

2326
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,599
that they are fully under the control of

2327
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:42,518
the executive branch so the President

2328
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:43,869
ordered them to do that or they wouldn't

2329
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:47,050
have done it period

2330
01:39:43,868 --> 01:39:48,848
like if the president ordered them not

2331
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:51,159
to do it they wouldn't have done more

2332
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:54,840
than likely more than likely and and you

2333
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:57,829
know all probabilities okay so

2334
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:01,020
that's the difference right now so the

2335
01:39:57,829 --> 01:40:03,000
implications are really weird right so

2336
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,840
they have several options they could do

2337
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,760
nothing and very possibly they they

2338
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,890
could do nothing that's basically what I

2339
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,470
expected to see happen was this to come

2340
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:15,329
up again and then to say yeah no and

2341
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:17,130
that could happen that could be the

2342
01:40:15,329 --> 01:40:18,689
answer right and that's that tends to be

2343
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:24,090
the federal response when it comes to

2344
01:40:18,689 --> 01:40:26,099
marijuana is right say no and under

2345
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:28,020
normal circumstances that's what we

2346
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,730
would all expect would they have even

2347
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:31,470
bothered to announce it if they weren't

2348
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:33,959
gonna do something they didn't have to

2349
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:37,320
tell us it's true that that's the thing

2350
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:39,630
I mean the pressure vote the story that

2351
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:41,699
I did glanced at I don't think they

2352
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:43,560
announced it quite as intention like

2353
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:45,119
they didn't mean for this to happen

2354
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,280
because the number of different news

2355
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:51,059
agencies are talking about it somebody

2356
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:54,090
had like it forwarded the wrong email to

2357
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:56,250
the wrong person and we're gonna be

2358
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:58,739
looking at this witch Queen now what is

2359
01:40:56,250 --> 01:41:02,340
it August yeah

2360
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:05,939
memo was leaked to I want to say it was

2361
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:07,550
Matt Fournier but I'm not positive and

2362
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:10,619
so yeah I'm not sure that this was a

2363
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:12,600
intended to be as public okay publicized

2364
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:15,300
as it has been but who knows they shake

2365
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:19,289
it's leaked on purpose - yes exactly

2366
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:21,119
well thanks - they could have leaked it

2367
01:41:19,289 --> 01:41:23,100
to you know kind of test public

2368
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:25,710
sentiment on it in a variety how it's

2369
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:28,289
gonna fly yeah like a comedian tweets a

2370
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:30,480
joke that's what they do

2371
01:41:28,289 --> 01:41:33,569
if they do nothing then you know where

2372
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:36,419
we are nothing changes except that

2373
01:41:33,569 --> 01:41:38,579
whoever the next president is then has

2374
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:40,539
the authority to come and shut all this

2375
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:44,649
[ __ ] down if they want to

2376
01:41:40,539 --> 01:41:46,720
under federal law and don't kid yourself

2377
01:41:44,649 --> 01:41:50,079
Trump will do that his whole campaign

2378
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:52,990
sparks a bad man you know it's this

2379
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:54,559
whole campaign is insane it doesn't

2380
01:41:52,989 --> 01:41:58,079
surprise me that you're having trouble

2381
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:03,220
[Music]

2382
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:04,720
alright so the DEA could possibly come

2383
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:06,220
out and say hey this does have medicinal

2384
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:09,550
value we can Karev

2385
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:11,619
yeah alright so yeah so option one do

2386
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:13,869
nothing and that that's probably what

2387
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:16,680
the consensus what everybody expects

2388
01:42:13,869 --> 01:42:19,300
right but option two is they reschedule

2389
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:22,300
which means it goes somewhere between

2390
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:26,590
two and five on the on the scheduled

2391
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:29,860
right list okay and that puts it under

2392
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:33,430
the jurisdiction of the FDA

2393
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:37,149
so now if it's scheduled anywhere below

2394
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:40,210
one it's under FDA so what does that

2395
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:42,879
mean well even if it drops the to a lot

2396
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:45,369
of good things happy a lot of good

2397
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:48,130
things a lot of strange things happen

2398
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:50,500
because I we've spent an amazingly long

2399
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:53,500
time trying to figure out how to make it

2400
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,960
too punitive for people the risk smoking

2401
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,970
or having weed and all of those rules

2402
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:01,149
are still in place even in places like

2403
01:42:57,970 --> 01:43:02,860
Colorado so rescheduling it anywhere on

2404
01:43:01,149 --> 01:43:04,689
the sched will still leave some really

2405
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:06,130
interesting questions it really really

2406
01:43:04,689 --> 01:43:08,409
does well like I said in putting it

2407
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:11,199
anywhere on the schedule makes it under

2408
01:43:08,409 --> 01:43:14,680
the authority of the FDA so that leaves

2409
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:17,199
a whole bunch of questions of how and

2410
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:18,610
you know how how would that even begin

2411
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:20,949
to work right it's not a typical

2412
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:22,029
pharmaceutical what I predicted me I

2413
01:43:20,949 --> 01:43:23,309
don't know if I've said this on an

2414
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:26,050
episode before what I predict

2415
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:28,450
unfortunately maybe if we do go to a

2416
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:29,920
national I thought it would be medical

2417
01:43:28,449 --> 01:43:32,079
first but it looks like we may have a

2418
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:35,710
national recreational pro ball ready

2419
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:37,420
done they'll find somebody right okay

2420
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:39,279
holy [ __ ] you're correct we have they're

2421
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:40,779
gonna find somebody to grow it and then

2422
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:42,279
it's not gonna be something friendly

2423
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:43,779
it's gonna be a mass-produced product

2424
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:45,099
that is gonna be and they're gonna wipe

2425
01:43:43,779 --> 01:43:46,960
out all the small growers like what

2426
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:50,020
we've got going now see it's it's it's

2427
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:52,960
just not happening it's not happening

2428
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:56,500
you know what I mean that's a top-down

2429
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,119
kind of affectation a political change

2430
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,829
right and it's not happening it's

2431
01:43:58,119 --> 01:44:00,489
happening from the bottom up on the

2432
01:43:59,829 --> 01:44:02,619
state level

2433
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:05,050
a third often they have rather than

2434
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:07,779
rescheduling they could delist it they

2435
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:10,029
could D schedule completely and and they

2436
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:12,539
could even go so far as to recommend

2437
01:44:10,029 --> 01:44:15,899
that you know

2438
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:18,899
although it's delisted and not a

2439
01:44:15,899 --> 01:44:22,349
scheduled drug that it needs special

2440
01:44:18,899 --> 01:44:28,949
care so the ATF could be come the ATF

2441
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:31,860
see instead of cannabis in their acronym

2442
01:44:28,949 --> 01:44:34,590
I wish they wouldn't but that's totally

2443
01:44:31,859 --> 01:44:37,889
on the list of possibilities well and

2444
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:41,159
and some of the analysis that I read the

2445
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:44,900
policy analysis that if you look at you

2446
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:47,550
know kind of the recent history of

2447
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:49,259
structuring government this would

2448
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:53,690
probably be the way they would do it

2449
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:56,940
because of integration with like

2450
01:44:53,689 --> 01:45:00,539
homeland security ATF is already fully

2451
01:44:56,939 --> 01:45:03,479
integrated and so in this transition

2452
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:06,180
period where we're going from illegal to

2453
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:09,779
legal the ATF would be able to monitor

2454
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:12,360
the legal grows and keep out cartels and

2455
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:14,250
stuff like that and then their role

2456
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:17,670
would diminish as it has with alcohol

2457
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:20,550
you know the ATF was heavy in regulation

2458
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:22,409
when alcohol first became legal and then

2459
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:25,829
they've you know eased off on alcohol

2460
01:45:22,409 --> 01:45:26,760
right this point it's just regulated

2461
01:45:25,829 --> 01:45:29,069
like anything else

2462
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:31,140
yes state regulatory agency has

2463
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:33,210
inspectors the inspectors come by and

2464
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:36,180
check stuff with something like this

2465
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:38,250
that's a retail distributed and toxicant

2466
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:40,590
like there'd be the occasional ID sting

2467
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:41,939
but it's really not that complicated to

2468
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:43,829
turn it into a product just like

2469
01:45:41,939 --> 01:45:46,049
anything else exactly and and that's

2470
01:45:43,829 --> 01:45:47,880
what be scheduling it and putting it

2471
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:49,470
under the atf jurisdiction would do and

2472
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,539
it would solve the government's problem

2473
01:45:49,470 --> 01:45:53,400
worried about cartels getting in and

2474
01:45:51,539 --> 01:45:56,220
stuff like that cuz then they could go

2475
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:58,589
to every state and inspect them see what

2476
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:00,449
i mean yeah and without even having to

2477
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:02,850
put any regulations on it you know just

2478
01:46:00,449 --> 01:46:05,010
just looking for money laundering and

2479
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:07,320
tax evasion and stuff like that you know

2480
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,730
what i mean like they do with the ATF

2481
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:11,819
does with alcohol they only do the

2482
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:13,889
top-level do you think anybody else has

2483
01:46:11,819 --> 01:46:15,299
thought this idea through or do you

2484
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:16,800
think this is something

2485
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,750
I didn't just make this [ __ ] up you know

2486
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,840
I went out and read smarter people to me

2487
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:24,239
and this is what they think I think the

2488
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,610
odds of them D scheduling cannabis in

2489
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:30,449
the next couple months is around like

2490
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:33,449
one or two or three percent at most if

2491
01:46:30,449 --> 01:46:36,989
the DEA does anything it will likely be

2492
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:39,019
lower the schedule a point or two so

2493
01:46:36,989 --> 01:46:41,369
down to schedule two or three which I

2494
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:43,350
mean we can debate for a really long

2495
01:46:41,369 --> 01:46:48,210
time if it belongs on the schedule at

2496
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:49,950
all or and if so where but I really

2497
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:51,840
don't think the DEA is gonna do anything

2498
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:54,569
because that's historically what they've

2499
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:57,900
always done is just nothing and the

2500
01:46:54,569 --> 01:47:00,659
marijuana is too big a piece of the drug

2501
01:46:57,899 --> 01:47:02,670
war pie where eighty percent of all drug

2502
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:05,159
comes to all illicit drug consumers only

2503
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:07,079
consume cannabis you take cannabis out

2504
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:08,729
of that equation and they've got a real

2505
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:11,640
hard time justifying a lot of their

2506
01:47:08,729 --> 01:47:13,379
budgets true and that's why they spent

2507
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,760
so many times flying around there's so

2508
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:19,109
much time flying around chopping down

2509
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:20,579
cannabis plants in the woods like it's

2510
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:24,420
because they if they don't they don't

2511
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:26,729
get paid and like so if they do

2512
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:28,800
federally regulated to another schedule

2513
01:47:26,729 --> 01:47:30,599
is my gonna have to become a pharmacist

2514
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,449
basically now to be a budtender am I

2515
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:35,970
gonna have to wear a lab coat and go a

2516
01:47:33,449 --> 01:47:38,599
little bit more extreme and get major or

2517
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:41,820
some sort of pharmaceutical every laws

2518
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:45,380
accreditation I think it wouldn't change

2519
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:46,380
state laws but it would give the FDA

2520
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:51,010
opportunity

2521
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:53,060
[Music]

2522
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:55,100
depending on where it falls on the

2523
01:47:53,060 --> 01:48:01,820
schedule bud tending would still be a

2524
01:47:55,100 --> 01:48:04,219
federal offense and but even if it moved

2525
01:48:01,819 --> 01:48:07,789
to just schedule to the ability for

2526
01:48:04,219 --> 01:48:10,430
doctors to research it would increase

2527
01:48:07,789 --> 01:48:12,469
greatly like one of the main hurdles

2528
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:13,520
right now is like if you get your whole

2529
01:48:12,469 --> 01:48:15,529
study approved

2530
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,260
there's only one small place where you

2531
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:20,389
can get the cannabis from if you watch

2532
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:22,130
Sanjay Gupta's marijuana specials you

2533
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:24,530
can check out where that place is and

2534
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:26,719
what it's all about but the supply is

2535
01:48:24,529 --> 01:48:28,250
still drastically limited and with the

2536
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,949
number of different compounds in the

2537
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:33,409
cannabis plant the number of different

2538
01:48:30,949 --> 01:48:35,238
medical applications that people in our

2539
01:48:33,409 --> 01:48:37,369
industry have seen hinted at but would

2540
01:48:35,238 --> 01:48:40,009
like further research on all of those

2541
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:49,219
studies get a lot easier to do oh yeah

2542
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:50,840
if it opens up everything everything as

2543
01:48:49,219 --> 01:48:52,789
far as research goes yeah that door

2544
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:55,310
really opens would we be able to study

2545
01:48:52,789 --> 01:48:57,350
cannabis at University of southern

2546
01:48:55,310 --> 01:49:02,690
Colorado and Colorado State University

2547
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:04,400
yes okay alright and I mean I really

2548
01:49:02,689 --> 01:49:08,119
don't think the DEA is gonna move on

2549
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:10,039
this if the federal government moves in

2550
01:49:08,119 --> 01:49:13,519
my opinion it will because it acting

2551
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:16,430
president rallies Congress just like

2552
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,820
they do on countless other issues using

2553
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:22,850
the bully pulpit and it will be a long

2554
01:49:19,819 --> 01:49:25,039
drawn-out process is my opinion but who

2555
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:30,920
knows the DEA could jump for all kinds

2556
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:32,319
of reasons well this was policy analysis

2557
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:37,109
for cute

2558
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:41,109
research just there their take on it is

2559
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:43,988
right now nobody knows what's in this

2560
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:45,509
election cycle that you know basically

2561
01:49:43,988 --> 01:49:49,000
everybody's pulling out all the stops

2562
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:51,070
then all bets are off right and that you

2563
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,099
know the benefit here you know in this

2564
01:49:51,069 --> 01:49:55,719
in this situation for Clinton it could

2565
01:49:54,099 --> 01:49:57,578
be the tipping point could be the thing

2566
01:49:55,719 --> 01:49:59,948
that does after all these [ __ ] years

2567
01:49:57,578 --> 01:50:04,149
you know what I mean and and you know

2568
01:49:59,948 --> 01:50:06,460
sadly he gave about five examples that's

2569
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:08,259
how it works in this country you know

2570
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:11,529
what I mean fortunately you know there's

2571
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:14,079
there's enough support out there that it

2572
01:50:11,529 --> 01:50:18,340
could get done without too much turmoil

2573
01:50:14,078 --> 01:50:20,559
now you know ya could fly you could do

2574
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:21,699
it and we've so mama's a lame duck he's

2575
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,460
got nothing to lose

2576
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:27,428
true he's on his way out he is doors

2577
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:29,408
about to close on his ass they've never

2578
01:50:27,429 --> 01:50:34,840
said a nice word about him before what

2579
01:50:29,408 --> 01:50:38,488
he doesn't give a [ __ ] you know we were

2580
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:41,170
talking about to election vote

2581
01:50:38,488 --> 01:50:43,509
situations where about a hundred people

2582
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:44,800
voice their concern on one way and two

2583
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:47,020
or three people stood up and voiced

2584
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,310
their concern on the opposition and for

2585
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:51,550
some reason the council members went

2586
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:54,190
with the lower votes in both cases was

2587
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:55,810
in Colorado Springs recently on two very

2588
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:57,368
different issue very different issues

2589
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,110
but it with the same damn way well we're

2590
01:50:57,368 --> 01:51:01,299
seeing we're seeing here in southern

2591
01:50:59,109 --> 01:51:03,729
Colorado we're seeing the culture war

2592
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:05,789
like really starting to bubble up you

2593
01:51:03,729 --> 01:51:07,479
know we're seeing this movement this

2594
01:51:05,789 --> 01:51:10,719
whatever-it-is movement against

2595
01:51:07,479 --> 01:51:12,908
marijuana we're seeing the City Council

2596
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:16,599
and Colorado Springs taking all kinds of

2597
01:51:12,908 --> 01:51:19,960
actions that are just really opposed to

2598
01:51:16,599 --> 01:51:22,000
public outcry and like one of those is

2599
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:23,408
on marijuana but there were other issues

2600
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,349
like completely unrelated to marijuana

2601
01:51:23,408 --> 01:51:28,179
where the public was you know really

2602
01:51:26,349 --> 01:51:30,250
vocal on it and they still move like

2603
01:51:28,179 --> 01:51:31,600
directly against right away and with the

2604
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,219
other way

2605
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:36,340
and

2606
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:38,679
it's you know it's it's getting thick

2607
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:40,569
around here and and you know it's kind

2608
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:44,979
of getting thick nationally too right

2609
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:45,849
and you know what I mean politics goes

2610
01:51:44,979 --> 01:51:48,159
in cycles

2611
01:51:45,849 --> 01:51:50,860
I mean pull out a history book or just

2612
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:52,748
if you're older think back it goes

2613
01:51:50,859 --> 01:51:54,429
liberal conservative liberal

2614
01:51:52,748 --> 01:52:01,929
conservative and it has for the last

2615
01:51:54,429 --> 01:52:05,949
hundred years and we Reagan true but

2616
01:52:01,929 --> 01:52:07,748
it's getting more and more conservative

2617
01:52:05,948 --> 01:52:10,509
right now because it got more and more

2618
01:52:07,748 --> 01:52:13,269
liberal for a minute we made some nice

2619
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:15,159
progress and some nice issues but at the

2620
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:17,559
same time the conservative folks the

2621
01:52:15,158 --> 01:52:20,609
anti pot groups they've been getting

2622
01:52:17,559 --> 01:52:22,840
clobbered in election after election and

2623
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:24,308
council meeting after council meeting

2624
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:28,960
and license hearing after license

2625
01:52:24,309 --> 01:52:31,420
hearing and they're pissed so down here

2626
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:33,248
they're going with the nuclear option it

2627
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:39,609
kind of seems like they are nationally

2628
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:42,069
too given Trump's popularity yeah but if

2629
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:43,988
if more people don't get active and I

2630
01:52:42,069 --> 01:52:45,639
mean that takes paying attention it

2631
01:52:43,988 --> 01:52:49,359
takes some dedication it takes reading

2632
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:52,179
the news occasionally it takes staying

2633
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:55,509
informed it's not something that you can

2634
01:52:52,179 --> 01:52:57,880
just do overnight but if more people are

2635
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:59,380
aged and more people that aren't in the

2636
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,630
cannabis don't start getting involved

2637
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:05,248
like it can get real ugly for the next

2638
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:08,199
couple of years eight years at least yep

2639
01:53:05,248 --> 01:53:09,819
register and vote register and vote I

2640
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:11,399
was gonna I was gonna say the ball is in

2641
01:53:09,819 --> 01:53:13,899
your hands but that just sounds gross

2642
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:16,629
vote your conscience on the presidential

2643
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:19,420
candidate but support cannabis industry

2644
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:20,889
yes please do absolutely everyone at

2645
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:22,658
this table I realize have in the

2646
01:53:20,889 --> 01:53:24,400
cannabis industry the legal cannabis

2647
01:53:22,658 --> 01:53:27,339
industry that's something I want to add

2648
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:30,368
I come from the black market I come from

2649
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:32,019
the dark side of this industry if there

2650
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:34,630
weren't a legal cannabis market you know

2651
01:53:32,019 --> 01:53:36,159
where I would be probably still be part

2652
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:38,650
of the boy I'd be crushing the black

2653
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:41,198
market just like I used to do yep now

2654
01:53:38,649 --> 01:53:44,109
that I've got a legitimate job I pay a

2655
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:44,899
lot of damn taxes I have a time clock

2656
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:47,329
now

2657
01:53:44,899 --> 01:53:49,670
and doing everything legit I've got got

2658
01:53:47,329 --> 01:53:52,729
manifests and invoices for every gram a

2659
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:55,429
product I produce now it was I watched

2660
01:53:52,729 --> 01:53:56,899
it happen I I spent a lot of time kind

2661
01:53:55,429 --> 01:54:01,609
of in the gray world working for

2662
01:53:56,899 --> 01:54:03,738
caregivers and one by one the dried up

2663
01:54:01,609 --> 01:54:05,839
because it was too much of a hassle now

2664
01:54:03,738 --> 01:54:07,639
there's not enough profit in in Colorado

2665
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,920
because most of that's going to leave

2666
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:15,140
market now Mike and I got to watch the

2667
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:16,670
whole thing shift the street to the

2668
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:18,650
caregiver model to the kind of a

2669
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:21,199

remember you could bake potatoes on the

2692
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:28,640
floor that [ __ ] we probably tried the

2693
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,010
learning days were fun yeah a lot of a

2694
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:33,079
lot of years of experience a lot of

2695
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:34,969
battles that were fought I mean years

2696
01:55:33,079 --> 01:55:38,229
before the show started going to making

2697

01:55:42,289 --> 01:55:46,130
still listening like yeah I had to fail

2700
01:55:44,779 --> 01:55:48,259
a thousand times to learn the hundred

2701
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:49,760
things that I learned I fail so many

2702
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,070
times I had to sit through hundreds

2703
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,900
ounces hours of council meetings 100

2704

watching the process happen yeah

2708
01:56:00,789 --> 01:56:09,710
watching fiction on cultivation of a

2709
01:56:07,399 --> 01:56:12,349
large farm once supported that learned a

2710
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:14,930
lot I mean just going through and

2711
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:18,620
watching it took up I mean hundreds of

2712
01:56:14,930 --> 01:56:20,539
hours it just so that now that all of

2713
01:56:18,619 --> 01:56:23,779
this is going down we can be active in

2714

area and they'll be fighting it because

2732
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:07,190
it's not enough in their eyes and if you

2733
01:57:05,329 --> 01:57:09,590
look at Colorado's rules and how it all

2734
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:13,579
hatched out like it's not enough in our

2735
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:15,140
eyes we didn't get clubs clubs are a big

2736
01:57:13,579 --> 01:57:16,970
issue but they're not even close to the

2737
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:19,700
only issue we I mean it's it's not

2738
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:21,289
enough yet it's just not but the reality

2739
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:24,199
of the situation is it's the best

2740
01:57:21,289 --> 01:57:27,590
scenario anyone's got on the planet by

2741
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:29,869
miles um there are a couple of states

2742
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:32,869
coming up behind us that might end up in

2743
01:57:29,869 --> 01:57:36,170
similar positions cannabis wise but is a

2744
01:57:32,869 --> 01:57:38,170
consumer is a patient as a member of the

2745
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:42,130
community like I can't see it getting

2746
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:44,600
much better than this right now

2747
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:47,329
not for us the only thing they can

2748
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:49,430
really improve for us it's pricing and

2749
01:57:47,329 --> 01:57:52,359
that comes in time we watch that happen

2750
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:55,369
with the medical market just takes time

2751
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:57,529
as more states legalize as the tourism

2752
01:57:55,369 --> 01:58:00,050
industry dips down a little bit is more

2753
01:57:57,529 --> 01:58:00,800
shops open this competition gets better

2754
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:03,890
is

2755
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,630
people become more talented there's a

2756
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:08,420
lot of brother-in-law's too got hired to

2757
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:10,989
grow a lot of warehouse weed I mean it

2758
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:14,149
didn't come out so hot for some of them

2759
01:58:10,989 --> 01:58:17,409
tend to be a problem I want to predict

2760
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:20,239
the cannabis shortage this summer it

2761
01:58:17,409 --> 01:58:23,899
it's been happening the state estimates

2762
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:25,429
were a ton or more under consumption for

2763
01:58:23,899 --> 01:58:27,439
our production right now so we're not

2764
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:30,920
even close to meeting demand can I bust

2765
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:33,649
out a humble brag I run at 80 we have 85

2766
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:37,100
oh I heard these no 85 lights in the

2767
01:58:33,649 --> 01:58:40,069
flowering room and I pulled 200 and I

2768
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:52,700
think 217 pounds is what I think I

2769
01:58:40,069 --> 01:58:54,079
remember reading remember 37 wood that

2770
01:58:52,699 --> 01:58:55,909
might just be a number I made my head

2771
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:59,449
sounds close so somewhere around there

2772
01:58:55,909 --> 01:59:01,340
yeah yeah I could go look but um it's

2773
01:58:59,449 --> 01:59:03,829
I'm high [ __ ] so that number has gone in

2774
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:06,170
my head but yet between 215 and 230

2775
01:59:03,829 --> 01:59:09,640
something pounds of usable cannabis

2776
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:12,050
underneath 85 lights we pulled about 2.2

2777
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:13,730
pounds per light is what I think we math

2778
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:17,690
that out maybe 2.5 or something like

2779
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:19,399
that is what I did the math on so yeah

2780
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:21,259
I'll do what I can to produce those

2781
01:59:19,399 --> 01:59:22,819
tonnage --is of cannabis that we need

2782
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:26,140
for the summer you guys but I can't

2783
01:59:22,819 --> 01:59:26,139
promise you that you'll all be out there

2784
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:32,149
something pounds from 85 lights that

2785
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:33,950
should be inspiring like just look at

2786
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:35,869
the table for a second and then think

2787
01:59:33,949 --> 01:59:38,389
back to ten years ago cuz that's where

2788
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:41,029
they are in Louisiana Texas New York

2789
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:43,460
I mean countless other states so there

2790
01:59:41,029 --> 01:59:45,259
we are 10 or 15 years ago I'm gonna give

2791
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:46,850
them five or six years I attend a lot of

2792
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:48,289
the dab thing is catching on the

2793
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:50,270
internet moves us more quickly and

2794
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:53,359
people travel a lot more and I'm gonna

2795
01:59:50,270 --> 01:59:56,650
blame a lot of things on the traveling

2796
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,670
of jam bands and the music scene when

2797
01:59:56,649 --> 02:00:00,229
widespread goes on tour they're gonna

2798
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:02,300
stop I think they're in Austin this week

2799
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:04,129
people that traveled from Colorado to

2800
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:06,079
Austin are introduced and I'm sure

2801
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:07,819
Austin's already got dabs and [ __ ] but

2802
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:10,100
they're introducing more people to

2803
02:00:07,819 --> 02:00:12,019
shatter right now after the widespread

2804
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:12,719
show right now some of that's made it

2805
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:15,300
out but

2806
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:19,260
law wise what happens if you get caught

2807
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:21,000
with it like in Ohio or a number of

2808
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,810
those Middle States that nobody thinks

2809
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,859
about a lot

2810
02:00:21,810 --> 02:00:29,190
I'm sorry Ohio but there's there's a lot

2811
02:00:25,859 --> 02:00:31,500
of states we're having cannabis is a

2812
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:32,909
major offense it doesn't matter if

2813
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,829
you're sick it doesn't matter if you

2814
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:36,840
have cancer it doesn't matter if you've

2815
02:00:34,829 --> 02:00:38,909
got Crohn's disease they'll take your

2816
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:41,760
kids they'll take your house shout-out

2817
02:00:38,909 --> 02:00:43,800
to my crew from Ohio listen but I got a

2818
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:46,409
crew that's from Ohio that listen so

2819
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,719
shout out to all them kids look ooh what

2820
02:00:46,409 --> 02:00:50,670
up brother look when I was in Louisiana

2821
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:52,050
a year ago I watched somebody get like

2822
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:52,739
grabbed and thrown to the ground for

2823
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:54,659
smoking a joint

2824
02:00:52,738 --> 02:00:58,189
yeah handcuffed and thrown the back of a

2825
02:00:54,659 --> 02:01:01,319
squad car like in Party City

2826
02:00:58,189 --> 02:01:03,659
it's no joke a lot of places in the laws

2827
02:01:01,319 --> 02:01:06,329
move slow Louisiana just changed their

2828
02:01:03,659 --> 02:01:07,849
laws though and it's interesting they

2829
02:01:06,329 --> 02:01:09,960
seem to be on the road to legalization

2830
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:14,310
very very slowly

2831
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:15,899
well they the current regs are up to two

2832
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:19,230
and a half pounds is a misdemeanor

2833
02:01:15,899 --> 02:01:20,549
holder possession and to transfer of up

2834
02:01:19,229 --> 02:01:23,189
to an ounce to another adult as a

2835
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:24,960
misdemeanor um they've got one of the

2836
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:27,809
worst three strikes laws in the country

2837
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,279
though but you could pretty much walk

2838
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:35,100
out of their Jail from what I've seen on

2839
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:37,050
YouTube leave if you feel like yeah it's

2840
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:39,570
it's not something you want to play with

2841
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:42,360
them a lot of places in the laws slow to

2842
02:01:39,569 --> 02:01:43,920
change sorry the coffin to the

2843

2985
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:15,960
attached and a hash producing license

2986
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:18,270
it's nice hash or like water hash co2

2987
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,250
co2 very cool I don't own the company

2988
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:22,770
that's not the choice I would have made

2989
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:23,970
but by its product they're not cutting

2990
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:24,450
any corners with that I could tell you

2991
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:26,520
that much

2992
02:14:24,449 --> 02:14:30,000
he tried any of the distillate that's

2993
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,530
made from co2 no I really love that I've

2994
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,159
heard about it and I did not know that

2995
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:37,170
was made from co2 or this here this is

2996
02:14:35,159 --> 02:14:38,710
sphere X I'm about to drop it I've got

2997
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:40,060
two containers stacked up because it's

2998
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:44,109
to get that bottom bit out so I just

2999
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:46,330
turned this did it for me in July that's

3000
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:48,039
some spear axe it's made from co2 oil

3001
02:14:46,329 --> 02:14:50,109
and then they turn it these they use a

3002
02:14:48,039 --> 02:14:51,969
fractal distillation process as far as I

3003
02:14:50,109 --> 02:14:53,979
understand I don't know exactly what

3004
02:14:51,969 --> 02:14:56,020
that is but I know that the basics and

3005
02:14:53,979 --> 02:14:57,129
they pull out the goodies and that's

3006
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:58,330
what it looks like we'll take a dab of

3007
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:59,380
it here we can't do it right now it's

3008
02:14:58,329 --> 02:15:00,369
just too much of a pain in the ass it

3009
02:14:59,380 --> 02:15:02,199
will do it after the show I'll leave it

3010
02:15:00,369 --> 02:15:04,840
here so we see it yeah that's made from

3011
02:15:02,199 --> 02:15:06,909
co2 oil together some serious Terp so

3012
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:08,949
it's got some serious Terps on it this

3013
02:15:06,909 --> 02:15:11,559
one open so now you're reaching for the

3014
02:15:08,949 --> 02:15:13,809
clear I like the clear honestly I like

3015
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:15,910
the sphere X better okay yeah that's

3016
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:18,039
clear from California it's the super

3017
02:15:15,909 --> 02:15:19,960
Lemon Haze this is sphere x OG Kush and

3018
02:15:18,039 --> 02:15:23,260
I liked the Terps on this one I prefer

3019
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:24,699
the sphere X my friends my homies they

3020
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:27,909
listen to the show I'm honest about the

3021
02:15:24,699 --> 02:15:30,539
things I smoke and review it's almost

3022
02:15:27,909 --> 02:15:34,359
overwhelming right yeah literally

3023
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:39,430
Wow it's just it's almost Tudor P well

3024
02:15:34,359 --> 02:15:41,469
yeah yeah I can see that I'll take a big

3025
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:43,420
dab of something else and dip it into

3026
02:15:41,469 --> 02:15:45,100
that a little bit so that it's not so

3027
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:47,440
overwhelming yeah this one out the

3028
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:49,239
sphere X I could dab a gram of it by

3029
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:53,529
itself and knock off my throat doesn't

3030
02:15:49,238 --> 02:15:56,409
burn guys it's fear X you just got some

3031
02:15:53,529 --> 02:15:57,819
free advertising from this hey that

3032
02:15:56,409 --> 02:15:59,439
happens when you make a good product it

3033
02:15:57,819 --> 02:16:03,759
does make a good product Rasta Jeff will

3034
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:05,259
give you a shout out man everything's

3035
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:09,190
going good for you you got the new the

3036
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:11,350
business run in outdoor weed hopefully

3037
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:13,179
people have access to some clones or

3038
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:16,450
some seeds cuz now it's time to get

3039
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:18,280
those going yeah especially seeds yeah

3040
02:16:16,449 --> 02:16:20,380
you might be a little behind as you're

3041
02:16:18,279 --> 02:16:22,929
grown from seed you might be by now yes

3042
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:25,210
so well I guess the first question when

3043
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:30,340
should we put our plants outdoors in

3044
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:32,879
Colorado second week of May is that kind

3045
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:36,639
of that's like the earliest I'd do it

3046
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:38,709
I've put them out you know first to June

3047
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:40,209
and they still yielded just as good as

3048
02:16:38,709 --> 02:16:41,678
the ones that went out the second week

3049
02:16:40,209 --> 02:16:43,629
of May no they get a little extra

3050
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:45,819
attention to catch them up but yeah so

3051
02:16:43,629 --> 02:16:48,069
okay so yeah about a two week window

3052
02:16:45,819 --> 02:16:49,599
that's prime to put them out yeah by the

3053
02:16:48,069 --> 02:16:49,949
first weekend of June though if you

3054
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:52,170
haven't

3055
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:53,940
by then caramel excuse me a bourbon

3056
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:54,479
carry him out that weekend get him

3057
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:56,819
started

3058
02:16:54,479 --> 02:16:59,010
get him outdoors do you know offhand

3059
02:16:56,819 --> 02:17:01,799
when we're gonna start the flowering

3060
02:16:59,010 --> 02:17:03,630
season typically kind of varies from

3061
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:05,429
strangest drained but typically it's

3062
02:17:03,629 --> 02:17:06,779
around the end of July beginning got

3063
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:09,600
obvious all right

3064
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:12,000
that's here Colorado I believe that does

3065
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:13,290
change a little regionally right that's

3066
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,030
gonna be a little bit different the

3067
02:17:13,290 --> 02:17:16,740
dates when you put stuff outside the

3068
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:18,480
time frames are gonna be a little bit

3069
02:17:16,739 --> 02:17:21,199
different varying from coast to coast

3070
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:23,309
California you could put them out today

3071
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:25,020
probably be okay I have friends on

3072
02:17:23,309 --> 02:17:27,619
Instagram that they're already out today

3073
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:29,610
they've been out for weeks honestly yeah

3074
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:39,329
Oregon in Northern California there's

3075
02:17:29,610 --> 02:17:41,640
some oil out there though all right so

3076
02:17:39,329 --> 02:17:43,739
get them out there the first week of

3077
02:17:41,639 --> 02:17:45,299
June at the latest get them out there

3078
02:17:43,739 --> 02:17:46,500
get them ready hopefully you've got some

3079
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,879
clothes you've got some seeds they're

3080
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:49,709
going you've had them sexed already you

3081
02:17:47,879 --> 02:17:51,750
know if they're boys or girls yeah get

3082
02:17:49,709 --> 02:17:53,429
some plants healthy I don't get him too

3083
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:55,350
big because they're gonna grow really

3084
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:56,880
quickly outdoors last year a lot of

3085
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:58,020
people weren't prepared for the size of

3086
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:00,899
plants that they were growing and that

3087
02:17:58,020 --> 02:18:06,360
[ __ ] got way to camouflage got away from

3088
02:18:00,899 --> 02:18:07,468
them that's a good thing yeah so be

3089
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:10,079
prepared for that your plants are gonna

3090
02:18:07,468 --> 02:18:12,089
get really large outdoors make sure

3091
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:13,950
they're not root bound either that's

3092
02:18:12,090 --> 02:18:15,930
really important when you take them

3093
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:18,030
outside yeah when you put them in the

3094
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:20,219
ground I've just I've noticed through my

3095
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:22,290
years of experience rootbound plants

3096
02:18:20,218 --> 02:18:25,468
sometimes they go into shock going

3097
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:27,060
outside sometimes they go into shock in

3098
02:18:25,468 --> 02:18:30,209
a way that they want to start flowering

3099
02:18:27,059 --> 02:18:33,000
right away yeah okay and that's no good

3100
02:18:30,209 --> 02:18:35,759
yeah so make sure they're not rebound

3101
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,799
and that's you know if you have if the

3102
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,750
weather is holding or like you have a

3103
02:18:37,799 --> 02:18:42,809
greenhouse or some you can put out

3104
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:44,639
earlier than the second week of May but

3105
02:18:42,809 --> 02:18:46,170
also right now we're around 12 hours of

3106
02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:51,599
light here in the

3107
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:53,460
first week in April so if you put plants

3108
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:55,950
outside there is a chance that can go

3109
02:18:53,459 --> 02:18:57,659
into bloom and you don't want that to

3110
02:18:55,950 --> 02:19:04,500
happen isn't gonna revenge aren't they

3111
02:18:57,659 --> 02:19:07,500
yeah yeah we're gonna flower that bad

3112
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:08,549
structure and limbs break off and it's

3113
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:10,620
just no good

3114
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:12,149
all right so kind of be don't let them

3115
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:14,700
get root bound and that leads me into my

3116
02:19:12,149 --> 02:19:16,558
next question perfectly I was gonna ask

3117
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:18,389
you if we should plant into the dirt

3118
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:22,199
outside or if we should take them

3119
02:19:18,388 --> 02:19:25,170
outside in pots my I mean my preferred

3120
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:27,349
method being kind of a crunchy hippie I

3121
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:30,599
like to plant straight in the ground

3122
02:19:27,349 --> 02:19:33,569
it's it's less work I feel like and the

3123
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:35,670
plants just are healthier but you know

3124
02:19:33,569 --> 02:19:40,260
doing it in containers who is very very

3125
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:42,090
possible - last year I did plants in 150

3126
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:44,340
gallon smart pots for the first time and

3127
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:48,450
I was really stoked with those healthier

3128
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:50,399
your stocks gigantic your arms the the

3129
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:52,800
first and second round of class that got

3130
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:56,850
put in there got stolen by some [ __ ]

3131
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:59,728
[ __ ] I haven't talked much about it

3132
02:19:56,850 --> 02:20:01,290
but I had a horrible summer we talked

3133
02:19:59,728 --> 02:20:03,989
about some people getting ripped off you

3134
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:05,910
were one of those who ever took Jesse's

3135
02:20:03,989 --> 02:20:08,399
plant so they didn't get as big as name

3136
02:20:05,909 --> 02:20:11,159
is you know if the first ones I put out

3137
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:12,478
there what it got left there just stocks

3138
02:20:11,159 --> 02:20:15,420
probably would have been as big around

3139
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:19,349
as a 2-liter bottle they ended up about

3140
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:23,540
as big around as one of these 20 ounce

3141
02:20:19,350 --> 02:20:26,579
of water bottles okay wow that was with

3142
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:29,970
about four and a half weeks in bed they

3143
02:20:26,579 --> 02:20:30,959
were gonna be beast yeah the the first

3144
02:20:29,969 --> 02:20:33,090
ones that got taken

3145
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:35,969
they were my strange government mule i

3146
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:37,020
unders you want to tell us about

3147
02:20:35,969 --> 02:20:39,869
government mule I'll give you an

3148
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:41,729
opportunity to do that sure it's uh made

3149
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:45,570
by Mira

3150
02:20:41,728 --> 02:20:47,429
I think mara chimera is a company that's

3151
02:20:45,569 --> 02:20:49,409
not really in existence anymore he's

3152
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:51,090
still around though yeah yeah he just

3153
02:20:49,409 --> 02:20:53,850
doesn't make seeds anymore but it's a

3154
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:55,049
deep chunk Tom Hill's deep trunk crossed

3155
02:20:53,850 --> 02:20:58,590
with

3156
02:20:55,049 --> 02:21:00,509
g13 okay it's a you were growing the

3157
02:20:58,590 --> 02:21:03,600
[ __ ] out of that yeah the pheno I have

3158
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:06,449
is like pure indica it's real short and

3159
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:08,960
stocky in this plant that was in the

3160
02:21:06,449 --> 02:21:11,939
hundred fifty gallon smart pot last year

3161
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:13,639
within maybe six weeks to being outside

3162
02:21:11,939 --> 02:21:15,898
or no I didn't make it that long

3163
02:21:13,639 --> 02:21:18,238
probably about four weeks with being

3164
02:21:15,898 --> 02:21:21,148
outside it was seriously eight foot tall

3165
02:21:18,238 --> 02:21:25,078
six foot around six foot you know it was

3166
02:21:21,148 --> 02:21:30,448
just beast and that's not a strain that

3167
02:21:25,078 --> 02:21:32,279
really beasts like that so alright so

3168
02:21:30,449 --> 02:21:33,869
that leads me perfectly you keep helping

3169
02:21:32,279 --> 02:21:36,960
me out your segwaying into my next

3170
02:21:33,869 --> 02:21:39,569
questions on accident here if we're

3171
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,709
gonna put our plants into the ground do

3172
02:21:39,568 --> 02:21:42,000
we just want to throw them into the dirt

3173
02:21:40,709 --> 02:21:43,559
that's in the backyard or do we want to

3174
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,789
dig a hole and put some good dirt in

3175
02:21:43,559 --> 02:21:46,439
there are some good soil that we buy

3176
02:21:44,789 --> 02:21:49,500
from the store we just want to use the

3177
02:21:46,439 --> 02:21:52,470
backyard soil I mean if that's all you

3178
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:55,500
have you can use it I wouldn't know

3179
02:21:52,469 --> 02:21:57,719
right especially here in southern

3180
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:59,309
Colorado the native soil it's pretty

3181
02:21:57,719 --> 02:22:01,260
hard it's pretty dusty and kind of clay

3182
02:21:59,309 --> 02:22:02,728
like yeah that's been killed off pretty

3183
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:06,539
good especially you like in residential

3184
02:22:02,728 --> 02:22:10,618
areas and stuff it doesn't hold water

3185
02:22:06,539 --> 02:22:12,239
well when it's dusty like that the

3186
02:22:10,619 --> 02:22:14,460
nutrients that are in it that could

3187
02:22:12,238 --> 02:22:15,750
because of geo based soil there's a [ __ ]

3188
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:18,599
ton of nutrients in it but it's not

3189
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:20,760
accept accessible to the plant because

3190
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:22,859
of the structure of the soil so you're

3191
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:25,318
growing you basically end up growing in

3192
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:30,090
a pretty super salty environment yeah

3193
02:22:25,318 --> 02:22:31,948
yeah literally so at the very minimum to

3194
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:34,469
have you know pretty good results I'd

3195
02:22:31,949 --> 02:22:37,050
recommend but cutting your native soil

3196
02:22:34,469 --> 02:22:40,738
with like one part coco coiour or one

3197
02:22:37,049 --> 02:22:44,250
part peat moss and then one part native

3198
02:22:40,738 --> 02:22:49,078
soil and then one part worm castings are

3199
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:51,180
compost okay no and by default that that

3200
02:22:49,078 --> 02:22:53,279
soil recipe pretty much works everywhere

3201
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:57,720
and you'll end up with some really great

3202
02:22:53,279 --> 02:22:59,460
soil so you know that'd be your base so

3203
02:22:57,719 --> 02:23:01,618
then you can still add extra amendments

3204
02:22:59,459 --> 02:23:03,529
to that also if you if you wish you can

3205
02:23:01,619 --> 02:23:05,690
afford it and if you want to yeah

3206
02:23:03,530 --> 02:23:08,450
okay that's like farmer recipe that's

3207
02:23:05,690 --> 02:23:11,300
produce gets girl on that recipe like in

3208
02:23:08,450 --> 02:23:14,181
the raised permaculture beds okay that's

3209
02:23:11,299 --> 02:23:17,180
that's it so alright yeah so can we

3210
02:23:14,181 --> 02:23:18,739
throw that same recipe into those 150

3211
02:23:17,181 --> 02:23:20,390
gallon smart pots that's it that's a

3212
02:23:18,739 --> 02:23:22,940
actually exactly what I did I added a

3213
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:24,770
little more aeration to it and maybe

3214
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:27,471
went a little bit heavier on the peat

3215
02:23:24,771 --> 02:23:30,200
moss okay yeah that's exactly what I did

3216
02:23:27,470 --> 02:23:31,819
so yeah it worked out great and stocks

3217
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:33,860
the size of football of two liter

3218
02:23:31,819 --> 02:23:35,810
gallons that's huge bro that is huge

3219
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:41,360
good job I wish you had pictures to show

3220
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:42,860
me all right I'm gonna throw out a

3221
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:44,271
little bit of a soil mix that I wrote

3222
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:45,920
down I would buy if I were gonna use

3223
02:23:44,271 --> 02:23:47,450
hundred fifty gallon smart pots outside

3224
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:54,409
that's got to be a huge pot house that

3225
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:58,011
about six feet around yeah 24 28 inches

3226
02:23:54,409 --> 02:23:58,459
ish yes yes yeah that's that's a [ __ ]

3227
02:23:58,011 --> 02:24:03,950
cool

3228
02:23:58,459 --> 02:24:06,859
yeah I would put I would buy some bagged

3229
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:08,450
soil this mix I'm not too picky about

3230
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:10,250
that whatever the store has I like the

3231
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:12,200
roots organic I like to purr

3232
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:15,521
it's pretty much all the same [ __ ] it's

3233
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:15,521
a little bit different it's all the same

3234
02:24:16,299 --> 02:24:20,869
roots has more aeration in it like your

3235
02:24:18,979 --> 02:24:23,029
Fox farm products I always feel like

3236
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:28,660
they need a little perlite or something

3237
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:28,659
at it right because there's all the time

3238
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:33,049
it doesn't matter what you use I would

3239
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:34,610
definitely put worm castings in there I

3240
02:24:33,049 --> 02:24:36,109
like the coco coir like Jessie said I

3241
02:24:34,610 --> 02:24:38,090
think it gives the plants a little bit

3242
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:39,500
of adds moisture to the plants life

3243
02:24:38,090 --> 02:24:41,630
their vascular systems a little more

3244
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:43,640
healthy they just seem more hydrated

3245
02:24:41,629 --> 02:24:47,060
with the coco in there get more flavor

3246
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:48,819
coco most definitely it well it holds

3247
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:50,899
water differently than peat moss toes

3248
02:24:48,819 --> 02:24:52,279
you're like doubling down right there

3249
02:24:50,899 --> 02:24:54,079
you can use a little more nutrient you

3250
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:56,061
need a little more nutrient that's

3251
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:58,370
always I like to put perlite in there

3252
02:24:56,060 --> 02:25:00,470
just to keep it airy and fluffy and then

3253
02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:02,090
it helps you not over water especially

3254
02:25:00,470 --> 02:25:03,829
in outdoor situations you might get a

3255
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:05,720
rainy ass night that provides that save

3256
02:25:03,829 --> 02:25:07,011
your life for sure the peat moss like

3257
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:07,988
your ATAR the peat like you're saying

3258
02:25:07,011 --> 02:25:10,270
and

3259
02:25:07,988 --> 02:25:11,798
for pest prevention I we learned this

3260
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:13,479
from our good friend Sean shoutout to

3261
02:25:11,799 --> 02:25:15,549
King Cola if you're listening I like to

3262
02:25:13,478 --> 02:25:17,349
mix in the Quran Jamil and neem cakes if

3263
02:25:15,549 --> 02:25:19,600
we're going outdoors just to keep those

3264
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:22,270
bugs away yeah that's that's part of my

3265
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:23,799
personal I mean yeah you came real close

3266
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:27,970
to my personal recipe would you put some

3267
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:29,439
oyster shell in there from you guys I

3268
02:25:27,969 --> 02:25:30,998
don't do it myself but that's why I

3269
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:34,720
bring you guys here's a trick on the

3270
02:25:30,998 --> 02:25:37,449
oyster shell add co2 hydro store guy

3271
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:41,019
given away okay go to the feed store and

3272
02:25:37,449 --> 02:25:42,970
get moisture shell for chickens it's

3273
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:45,549
been collected off the beach it's not

3274
02:25:42,969 --> 02:25:47,858
ground-up its whole oyster shell breaks

3275
02:25:45,549 --> 02:25:50,049
down it takes it more time to break down

3276
02:25:47,859 --> 02:25:51,640
so put that in as a bit of a

3277
02:25:50,049 --> 02:25:54,279
time-release and then get the powdered

3278
02:25:51,639 --> 02:25:56,948
powderized oyster shell from your local

3279
02:25:54,279 --> 02:25:59,319
hydro store and you got two different

3280
02:25:56,949 --> 02:25:59,680
races available times yeah that's

3281
02:25:59,318 --> 02:26:00,998
awesome

3282
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:02,799
it helps you get all the way through the

3283
02:26:00,998 --> 02:26:04,930
season I like that you're a hydro store

3284
02:26:02,799 --> 02:26:08,879
guy that doesn't just make a shop at the

3285
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:08,879
hydro store your own feed store stuff

3286
02:26:08,908 --> 02:26:14,259
right one thing I want to mention you

3287
02:26:12,459 --> 02:26:15,579
can use bottled nutrients in your

3288
02:26:14,259 --> 02:26:17,498
outdoor grow if you're just gonna throw

3289
02:26:15,578 --> 02:26:19,238
the plants into some soil containers or

3290
02:26:17,498 --> 02:26:20,770
dig a hole in your backyard you can go

3291
02:26:19,238 --> 02:26:22,208
to the store you can buy some botanic

3292
02:26:20,770 --> 02:26:23,439
air you can buy some nectar of the Gods

3293
02:26:22,209 --> 02:26:25,329
you can buy whatever brand they've got

3294
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:27,578
they're a and B they're bloom feed

3295
02:26:25,328 --> 02:26:29,439
solution other bloom boosters you can

3296
02:26:27,578 --> 02:26:30,969
mix that up you're throwing it into some

3297
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:33,068
outdoor soil you can actually mix it up

3298
02:26:30,969 --> 02:26:35,408
kind of heavy you can feed it pretty

3299
02:26:33,068 --> 02:26:37,778
damn strong with that stuff outdoors you

3300
02:26:35,408 --> 02:26:39,488
can do that if you're not able to maybe

3301
02:26:37,779 --> 02:26:40,629
somebody's not able-body we're pretty

3302
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:42,038
healthy dudes we could do things

3303
02:26:40,629 --> 02:26:43,930
somebody doesn't have the physical

3304
02:26:42,039 --> 02:26:45,579
capabilities they could throw a few pots

3305
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:46,838
in the backyard and mix up some

3306
02:26:45,578 --> 02:26:48,158
nutrients and have somebody help them do

3307
02:26:46,838 --> 02:26:49,779
that way instead of having to mix up a

3308
02:26:48,158 --> 02:26:52,059
big batch of dirt and plant these you

3309
02:26:49,779 --> 02:26:55,029
can't do that you guys for sure we would

3310
02:26:52,059 --> 02:26:56,648
just as a ganja farmer myself an indoor

3311
02:26:55,029 --> 02:26:59,078
ganja farmer and Jesse and outdoor farm

3312
02:26:56,648 --> 02:27:00,818
boy I think we'd rather lead people into

3313
02:26:59,078 --> 02:27:02,439
this way of mixing up some soil outdoors

3314
02:27:00,818 --> 02:27:04,238
and letting nature kind of do its thing

3315
02:27:02,439 --> 02:27:07,059
it takes a lot of the guesswork out of

3316
02:27:04,238 --> 02:27:09,068
it this will prove this will promote

3317
02:27:07,059 --> 02:27:11,708
pest prevention and a healthy

3318
02:27:09,068 --> 02:27:14,038
environment oh yeah using those bottled

3319
02:27:11,709 --> 02:27:16,180
nutrients isn't gonna contribute to

3320
02:27:14,039 --> 02:27:18,939
plant health it's only gonna contribute

3321
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:20,860
to big buds yeah and the soil recipe so

3322
02:27:18,939 --> 02:27:23,680
we're talking about here they

3323
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:25,180
he'll put the healing of the earth they

3324
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:27,850
contribute back to that they make the

3325
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:29,470
soil better so when you leave there that

3326
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:33,729
that piece of ground is better than it

3327
02:27:29,469 --> 02:27:35,679
was before and that's one you know you I

3328
02:27:33,729 --> 02:27:37,719
suppose you can do that with bottle

3329
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:39,550
nutrients to just watch out for salt

3330
02:27:37,719 --> 02:27:42,099
build ups and stuff like that so right

3331
02:27:39,549 --> 02:27:44,979
that's not as friendly if you do grow

3332
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:47,890
outside do it on your land don't do it

3333
02:27:44,979 --> 02:27:49,989
in some National Forest don't be an

3334
02:27:47,889 --> 02:27:52,449
idiot like that and clean your [ __ ] up

3335
02:27:49,989 --> 02:27:57,909
like take your bottles inside don't make

3336
02:27:52,450 --> 02:28:00,040
don't ya like when you found it pick up

3337
02:27:57,909 --> 02:28:02,021
some trash I don't for pieces I think I

3338
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:05,680
have told the story on some of the older

3339
02:28:02,021 --> 02:28:07,680
episodes or the earlier ones but a few

3340
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:09,850
years ago there was a gigantic cartel

3341
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:13,030
bust here in the mountains real near

3342
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:14,710
here and I have family land that

3343
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:18,909
neighbors the land where they got busted

3344
02:28:14,709 --> 02:28:20,349
on so we hiked in you know after the

3345
02:28:18,909 --> 02:28:22,600
cops and you know just to check it out

3346
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:25,420
look around and the amount of trash up

3347
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:28,239
there was just appalling terrible that I

3348
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:30,549
grew up on that mountain and you know

3349
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:32,680
it's kind of almost brings a tear to

3350
02:28:30,549 --> 02:28:36,459
your eye to see that see that up there

3351
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:40,329
and is it accessible to folks like us no

3352
02:28:36,459 --> 02:28:41,529
no you'd be trespassing excuse me from

3353
02:28:40,329 --> 02:28:44,950
coughing what if we went to clean it

3354
02:28:41,530 --> 02:28:45,460
that's not really trespass I don't think

3355
02:28:44,950 --> 02:28:47,521
anyone

3356
02:28:45,459 --> 02:28:50,560
I don't think Bob would say anything so

3357
02:28:47,521 --> 02:28:52,930
that is I was gonna say yeah what was

3358
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:54,489
that four years ago that happened we're

3359
02:28:52,930 --> 02:28:56,530
still hauling trash out of there and

3360
02:28:54,489 --> 02:28:59,530
that's we make it it is a pretty good

3361
02:28:56,530 --> 02:29:02,620
hike from the road or from where my

3362
02:28:59,530 --> 02:29:03,850
cabin is but we make a few trips up

3363
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:06,880
there year and Houston trash Mountain

3364
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:11,620
cones that's yeah it's ridiculous how

3365
02:29:06,879 --> 02:29:13,750
much was up there so it's just also it's

3366
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:15,579
ridiculous how much the cops and the DA

3367
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:17,560
left up there because you could tell the

3368
02:29:15,579 --> 02:29:19,090
trash from the cartel growers and you

3369
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:21,279
can tell the trash from the cops and

3370
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:23,049
they just left [ __ ] up there the Dunkin

3371
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:25,500
Donuts was from the cops and the beans

3372
02:29:23,049 --> 02:29:28,170
and rice was from the cartel yep

3373
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:30,989
real straight right free you told me in

3374
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:32,069
my one of my friends dad's was a police

3375
02:29:30,989 --> 02:29:33,270
officer I don't know how much I'm

3376
02:29:32,069 --> 02:29:34,829
supposed to talk about that he's not a

3377
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:36,989
cop anymore so they can't probably do

3378
02:29:34,829 --> 02:29:38,940
[ __ ] but he was retiring at the time and

3379
02:29:36,989 --> 02:29:41,069
they called him and had him go stand

3380
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:42,750
there and watch like once they raided

3381
02:29:41,069 --> 02:29:44,309
everybody ran but they needed the teams

3382
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:46,590
to get up there like the DEA and [ __ ]

3383
02:29:44,309 --> 02:29:48,600
wanted to go and investigate so he stood

3384
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:50,159
there and watched just made sure that

3385
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:51,780
nobody went in that area but he said

3386
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:53,520
that he walked around and they had

3387
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:55,590
little camp set up like stoves with

3388
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:57,270
beans and rice and all the all the food

3389
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:59,159
was from Mexico it was all Mexican

3390
02:29:57,270 --> 02:30:01,020
packaging and straight up making Mexican

3391
02:29:59,159 --> 02:30:03,420
dinner up there every night even the

3392
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:06,239
miracle can grow containers that I have

3393
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:07,379
cleaned up off their they have Mexican

3394
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:08,100
writing on them there's no English no

3395
02:30:07,379 --> 02:30:10,769
none whatsoever

3396
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:13,838
you're like segwaying into the things

3397
02:30:10,770 --> 02:30:13,838
[Music]

3398
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:20,960
would you add anything to the soil mix

3399
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,959
before we move on but you do use azomite

3400
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:27,120
lessons I like doing minerals so I do

3401
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:30,180
basalt this is real similar to the

3402
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:40,140
Clackamas coupe recipe from the forums

3403
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:41,639
build soil basalt gypsum these are all

3404
02:30:40,139 --> 02:30:44,010
things you can find at your local garden

3405
02:30:41,639 --> 02:30:46,939
stores especially like gypsum dolomite

3406
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:49,979
lime those are all pretty easy to find

3407
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:51,810
then I used azomite those four

3408
02:30:49,979 --> 02:30:53,639
combinations of minerals you got pretty

3409
02:30:51,809 --> 02:30:55,289
much every single trace mineral in the

3410
02:30:53,639 --> 02:30:56,670
world covered right there that's gonna

3411
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:58,370
make your plants Turkey it's gonna make

3412
02:30:56,670 --> 02:31:02,909
it healthy you're gonna smell real well

3413
02:30:58,370 --> 02:31:05,070
and then oyster show shrimp mill fish

3414
02:31:02,909 --> 02:31:07,409
mill something like that some kind of I

3415
02:31:05,069 --> 02:31:08,699
like aqua products I stay away from bone

3416
02:31:07,409 --> 02:31:10,530
meal blood meal like slaughterhouse

3417
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:11,610
products I would use kelp meal if they

3418
02:31:10,530 --> 02:31:13,560
were up to me so I'm gonna write down

3419
02:31:11,610 --> 02:31:15,690
kelp meal for my style just not sure

3420
02:31:13,559 --> 02:31:17,930
what I offer I used to yeah tons of coke

3421
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:17,930
mill

3422
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:24,659
alfalfa meal I'll get for NEMA nitrogen

3423
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:27,510
yeah and alfalfa breaks down really

3424
02:31:24,658 --> 02:31:30,359
quick so um that can give you some of

3425
02:31:27,510 --> 02:31:33,510
that real early season you know boost to

3426
02:31:30,359 --> 02:31:36,119
get them exploded to you know pop bottle

3427
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:37,978
size stops for weeks it's gonna take up

3428
02:31:36,119 --> 02:31:40,050
90% of their nitrogen during the

3429
02:31:37,978 --> 02:31:42,719
vegetative phase of their lives yep

3430
02:31:40,049 --> 02:31:44,519
yeah yeah actually you don't want to

3431
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:45,868
over spike that that's why I'll falfa

3432
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:48,238
mills good because it breaks down so

3433
02:31:45,869 --> 02:31:49,560
quick you in the middle of flowering

3434
02:31:48,238 --> 02:31:50,698
towards the end of flowering you don't

3435
02:31:49,559 --> 02:31:53,250
want him to find a source of nitrogen

3436
02:31:50,699 --> 02:31:54,720
that can have some [ __ ] up ya know make

3437
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:57,478
them taste funky and it'll slow down the

3438
02:31:54,719 --> 02:32:01,078
flowering phase yeah it'll start to

3439
02:31:57,478 --> 02:32:03,840
finger little fingers foxtails alright

3440
02:32:01,078 --> 02:32:04,949
so you said a minute ago you cleaned up

3441
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:07,590
a bunch of [ __ ] miracle-gro

3442
02:32:04,949 --> 02:32:08,790
containers from the cartel grow site you

3443
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:10,170
guys if you want to google the cartel

3444
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:11,489
grow site i'm sure you could find it it

3445
02:32:10,170 --> 02:32:15,270
was the cartel girl found in the San

3446
02:32:11,488 --> 02:32:17,309
Isabel National Forest area 165 I was

3447
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:19,560
about probably four or five years ago I

3448
02:32:17,309 --> 02:32:21,750
was well well covered by the news around

3449
02:32:19,559 --> 02:32:23,158
here so they threw out a bunch of

3450
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:24,299
miracle-gro containers which tells me

3451
02:32:23,158 --> 02:32:27,000
that they probably weren't growing super

3452
02:32:24,299 --> 02:32:28,500
quality product no no let's talk for a

3453
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,590
minute about why we should never use

3454
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:33,809
Miracle Grow or any Scots type of

3455
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:35,969
product first of all Miracle Grow is

3456
02:32:33,809 --> 02:32:39,959
made by Scots which is owned by Monsanto

3457
02:32:35,969 --> 02:32:41,818
which is trying to force the entire

3458
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:44,429
world to be force-fed seeds that are

3459
02:32:41,818 --> 02:32:46,350
made by them which are all GMO produced

3460
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:48,779
to be able to be sprayed by their

3461
02:32:46,350 --> 02:32:51,328
products that are made by them they're

3462
02:32:48,779 --> 02:32:53,850
ruining a whole bunch of things and not

3463
02:32:51,328 --> 02:32:55,799
healthy I'm just [ __ ] circle right now

3464
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:57,960
player killing the bees they're they're

3465
02:32:55,799 --> 02:32:58,889
real it's all about money for science

3466
02:32:57,959 --> 02:33:00,959
issue and they're pretty much

3467
02:32:58,889 --> 02:33:03,510
single-handedly responsible for the to

3468
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:05,759
be die-off right now so we do not want

3469
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:07,109
to support anything with Monsanto in the

3470
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:09,300
first place is why we don't want to use

3471
02:33:07,109 --> 02:33:10,020
any type of Miracle Grow or Scotts

3472
02:33:09,299 --> 02:33:12,209
products

3473
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:15,149
yeah if you're gonna buy stuff like that

3474
02:33:12,209 --> 02:33:17,578
go to go to a hydroponics store go to

3475
02:33:15,148 --> 02:33:20,398
your local grocer or get a decent grow

3476
02:33:17,578 --> 02:33:23,939
soil don't go get like a turf builder at

3477
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:25,500
Home Depot or a lot of people hate on

3478
02:33:23,939 --> 02:33:27,658
the Fox water brand I think that's

3479
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:30,000
actually available at some of the larger

3480
02:33:27,658 --> 02:33:30,920
hardware stores like ace may have Sox

3481
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,329
farm

3482
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:34,579
farm isn't amazing but it's definitely

3483
02:33:32,329 --> 02:33:36,620
not bad yeah it's if you're gonna buy

3484
02:33:34,579 --> 02:33:38,959
something at Ace or Home Depot or Lowe's

3485
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:41,450
getfox farm don't get the Scots brand

3486
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:42,919
stuff yeah Pro mix is available in

3487
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:45,200
Fussell's places pro mix is a good

3488
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:48,040
product hot sunshine for pro mix yeah

3489
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:49,210
the sunshine different companies okay

3490
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:53,180
[Music]

3491
02:33:49,209 --> 02:34:01,279
it's the pretty much different for fire

3492
02:33:53,180 --> 02:34:03,260
Terry blends of micro so if you're doing

3493
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:06,560
some outdoor Pro mix oh yeah go get that

3494
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:07,579
that's not bad at all give me [ __ ]

3495
02:34:06,559 --> 02:34:09,670
golden out there

3496
02:34:07,579 --> 02:34:11,840
but let's talk about why not to use it

3497
02:34:09,670 --> 02:34:14,569
first of all the obvious reasons the

3498
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:17,239
there Monsanto products but they're way

3499
02:34:14,569 --> 02:34:20,000
over loaded with the wrong NPK ratios

3500
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:22,639
woah ton of nitrogen tons of nitrogen

3501
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,228
way too much and that soil is loaded

3502
02:34:22,639 --> 02:34:25,549
with these little they used to be green

3503
02:34:24,228 --> 02:34:28,039
when I was a kid these little green

3504
02:34:25,549 --> 02:34:31,188
speckles yeah and those are time-release

3505
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:33,020
nitrogen and basically there are little

3506
02:34:31,189 --> 02:34:34,399
time-released vitamins for the plant

3507
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:37,010
so what sucks about that is you don't

3508
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:38,478
have very good control of what you're

3509
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:40,219
feeding your planet however often you

3510
02:34:38,478 --> 02:34:42,260
water those are gonna dissolve and your

3511
02:34:40,219 --> 02:34:44,209
plants gonna get that nutrient you don't

3512
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:47,689
want nutrients go into your plant every

3513
02:34:44,209 --> 02:34:48,649
single time you water your build up

3514
02:34:47,689 --> 02:34:50,239
you're gonna start getting crinkled

3515
02:34:48,649 --> 02:34:51,228
leaves you're gonna see burnt tipsy buds

3516
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:53,360
aren't gonna taste funny

3517
02:34:51,228 --> 02:34:55,609
so don't use that type of stuff don't

3518
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:56,930
use any of that miracle girl feeding go

3519
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:59,390
to a real gross store

3520
02:34:56,930 --> 02:35:01,670
I recommend botanic air nectar of the

3521
02:34:59,389 --> 02:35:03,469
Gods I've seen great results from nectar

3522
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:04,670
of the Gods relation it's my buddy Steve

3523
02:35:03,469 --> 02:35:06,529
Daffy no I don't know if you listen to

3524
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:07,850
the podcast bro but you grow with nectar

3525
02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:10,729
of the Gods and the stuff you grow

3526
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:13,700
tastes really good so a nectar the Gods

3527
02:35:10,728 --> 02:35:16,369
is good botanic air is good I've used

3528
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:18,320
advanced nutrients and I had okay

3529
02:35:16,370 --> 02:35:19,880
results but I was more happy with

3530
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:23,059
botanic air by a long shot

3531
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:24,759
I did not like psycho at all the psycho

3532
02:35:23,059 --> 02:35:26,809
brand I do not approve I did not like it

3533
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:28,040
there are a lot of brands available to

3534
02:35:26,809 --> 02:35:28,939
store what's super hot right now I

3535
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:30,140
haven't been paying too much attention

3536
02:35:28,939 --> 02:35:32,909
to the new stuff

3537
02:35:30,139 --> 02:35:35,108
nectar we push

3538
02:35:32,909 --> 02:35:38,260
nectars coming up it takes a while to

3539
02:35:35,109 --> 02:35:40,420
get people switched over to align you

3540
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:42,909
know from my perspective for retail

3541
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:45,010
setting oh yeah but botanic air and

3542
02:35:42,909 --> 02:35:46,689
general hydroponics are which is

3543
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:48,100
definitely reliable general hydroponics

3544
02:35:46,689 --> 02:35:52,359
general organics

3545
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:55,420
um and then mills and some good [ __ ]

3546
02:35:52,359 --> 02:35:57,850
with mills I learned some last week some

3547
02:35:55,420 --> 02:36:00,029
things about mills that even this

3548
02:35:57,850 --> 02:36:02,529
organic growers gonna give him a shot

3549
02:36:00,029 --> 02:36:04,750
some endure suspense was killing it with

3550
02:36:02,529 --> 02:36:09,720
the mills he was crushing it dispense

3551
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:12,430
with the mills but yet bio business

3552
02:36:09,719 --> 02:36:13,688
especially for like outdoor canna is a

3553
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:16,779
great line if you want to spend some

3554
02:36:13,689 --> 02:36:17,170
money yeah yeah yeah they're well well

3555
02:36:16,779 --> 02:36:26,649
made

3556
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:27,728
jungle juice yeah juice I really

3557
02:36:26,648 --> 02:36:34,930
recommend if you can use bottled

3558
02:36:27,728 --> 02:36:36,670
nutrients I like to add humble honey go

3559
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:38,710
to the hydro store get yourself bottled

3560
02:36:36,670 --> 02:36:41,049
nutrients if you if you confuse don't

3561
02:36:38,709 --> 02:36:43,299
buy that stuff at the hardware store

3562
02:36:41,049 --> 02:36:44,438
don't buy try not to buy your soil and

3563
02:36:43,299 --> 02:36:46,028
stuff at the hardware store they're a

3564
02:36:44,439 --> 02:36:48,609
grow store somewhere if you live

3565
02:36:46,029 --> 02:36:56,859
somewhere honestly if you live somewhere

3566
02:36:48,609 --> 02:36:57,399
where that shit's inaccessible we can't

3567
02:36:56,859 --> 02:36:58,870
condone it

3568
02:36:57,398 --> 02:37:00,488
we can't encourage it so you're only

3569
02:36:58,870 --> 02:37:02,950
listening to this for entertainment

3570
02:37:00,488 --> 02:37:06,639
purposes where you do it's illegal but

3571
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:09,040
also it's not immoral so and you're

3572
02:37:06,639 --> 02:37:15,939
probably a grown-ass adults oh yeah yeah

3573
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:18,819
oh you better be hopefully you're an

3574
02:37:15,939 --> 02:37:23,950
adult all right we've got kind of rant

3575
02:37:18,818 --> 02:37:25,568
either so also last year in our area we

3576
02:37:23,950 --> 02:37:27,579
live in Pueblo Colorado this is kind of

3577
02:37:25,568 --> 02:37:28,959
it's not the valley but we are kind of

3578
02:37:27,579 --> 02:37:34,270
in a valley we're surrounded by

3579
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:35,858
mountains on every side the other day we

3580
02:37:34,270 --> 02:37:37,569
were in the Dust Bowl brother there's so

3581
02:37:35,859 --> 02:37:38,950
much wind and three just blowing I

3582
02:37:37,568 --> 02:37:41,630
thought my car was getting sandblasted

3583
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:46,131
yeah was miserable Animus cool

3584
02:37:41,630 --> 02:37:47,840
- it was weird sunshiny yeah so we're in

3585
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:50,421
this weird bowl and we get really

3586
02:37:47,841 --> 02:37:52,970
strange weather changes and drastic

3587
02:37:50,421 --> 02:37:54,800
weather changes it'll be today I used my

3588
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:57,770
heater and my air conditioner both in my

3589
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:59,989
car yeah me too yeah right now it's a

3590
02:37:57,771 --> 02:38:01,881
seven forty nine in the evening and I've

3591
02:37:59,989 --> 02:38:03,140
got the front door open and two windows

3592
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:10,640
open I thought I just heard the front

3593
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:13,251
door so yeah it's the weather changes a

3594
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:15,109
lot here my point is this caused a lot

3595
02:38:13,251 --> 02:38:17,390
of folks to get powdery mildew last year

3596
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:19,069
a lot of folks that grew outdoors their

3597
02:38:17,390 --> 02:38:20,751
plants were riddled with powdery mildew

3598
02:38:19,069 --> 02:38:22,520
so what I'm getting at is you've been

3599
02:38:20,751 --> 02:38:23,989
growing outdoors for a lot of years now

3600
02:38:22,521 --> 02:38:26,421
your dad's been growing outdoors for a

3601
02:38:23,989 --> 02:38:27,739
hundred years shut up to the old man

3602
02:38:26,421 --> 02:38:30,351
what's up rather good day good to hear

3603
02:38:27,739 --> 02:38:33,140
from you hope you're doing well how do

3604
02:38:30,351 --> 02:38:37,069
you guys go about preventing and taking

3605
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:41,751
care of powdery mildew outdoors you know

3606
02:38:37,069 --> 02:38:45,020
prevention planning the areas you know

3607
02:38:41,751 --> 02:38:47,120
we have plenty of circulation around our

3608
02:38:45,021 --> 02:38:48,801
plants we don't cram them together we

3609
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:51,921
clean the we Hollow amount in the

3610
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:55,909
Middle's we clean shape the lakes up all

3611
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:59,690
that you know all I go so far though you

3612
02:38:55,909 --> 02:39:01,521
know there's a few products a zmax I

3613
02:38:59,690 --> 02:39:03,831
mean I can't really recommend spraying

3614
02:39:01,521 --> 02:39:08,511
anything out of Bud but if you have to

3615
02:39:03,831 --> 02:39:12,460
you have to haze max green cleaner just

3616
02:39:08,511 --> 02:39:15,261
good ol h2 or H hydrogen peroxide h2o2

3617
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:18,350
3630 percent hydrogen peroxide diluted

3618
02:39:15,261 --> 02:39:20,810
at about 20 to 30 miles per gallon will

3619
02:39:18,351 --> 02:39:25,280
help keep it away but it will not stop

3620
02:39:20,810 --> 02:39:26,569
it more organically T's would help like

3621
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,950
you could even brew it to you it's like

3622
02:39:26,569 --> 02:39:29,630
me I think Shawn would tell you to

3623
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:32,020
brother nice no post about some karanji

3624
02:39:29,630 --> 02:39:34,090
and there to see your

3625
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:37,090
I think you're gonna want to fungus

3626
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:38,649
Dominator to the battle OPM yes that

3627
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:42,670
will disrupt the pH on the surface of

3628
02:39:38,649 --> 02:39:44,770
the leaves yeah and then like there's

3629
02:39:42,670 --> 02:39:47,969
some some plant teas you can make I've

3630
02:39:44,770 --> 02:39:52,840
been experimenting with Shannon mill

3631
02:39:47,969 --> 02:39:55,059
which is it's a natural herb you find it

3632
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:59,200
in a lot of like tea blends for like

3633
02:39:55,059 --> 02:40:00,279
drinking like hot tea it's considered a

3634
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:04,659
weed in most of the world

3635
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:06,370
it grows naturally here in Colorado so

3636
02:40:04,659 --> 02:40:08,170
I'll be able to while crafted in the

3637
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:11,140
fall I've just been buying it from the

3638
02:40:08,170 --> 02:40:13,870
health food store right now but it's a

3639
02:40:11,139 --> 02:40:27,819
natural antal antifungal and

3640
02:40:13,870 --> 02:40:29,530
antimicrobial yeah so I believe it makes

3641
02:40:27,819 --> 02:40:32,469
it tea that has a higher pH was another

3642
02:40:29,530 --> 02:40:36,010
thing I heard but with those you know

3643
02:40:32,469 --> 02:40:39,959
two properties it battles p.m. pretty

3644
02:40:36,010 --> 02:40:42,579
good it looks like so and then also

3645
02:40:39,959 --> 02:40:45,399
added benefit of it is it's high in P

3646
02:40:42,579 --> 02:40:46,780
and K so that's just another you're

3647
02:40:45,399 --> 02:40:48,909
going to help increase trichomes

3648
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:51,700
yeah that's I'm actually right now my

3649
02:40:48,909 --> 02:40:56,770
current run I gave half my yellow G

3650
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:59,200
plants a teammate of this on week five

3651
02:40:56,770 --> 02:41:04,090
right now I think I gave half of them a

3652
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:05,950
tea made of that and then I gave up the

3653
02:41:04,090 --> 02:41:08,350
other half for that feeding they just

3654
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:09,640
got water so I'm kind of kicking back

3655
02:41:08,350 --> 02:41:11,110
seeing let's say I'm gonna wait and see

3656
02:41:09,639 --> 02:41:14,859
what does what that's always a good

3657
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:18,850
thing to do how do you feel about is it

3658
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:21,370
oh so twenty-eight seems like I'm really

3659
02:41:18,850 --> 02:41:23,950
great yeah yeah the numbers mixed up

3660
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:27,670
there's so many others potassium silicon

3661
02:41:23,950 --> 02:41:30,970
I think yes yes a lot of growers are

3662
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:34,510
really respect or preaching it I haven't

3663
02:41:30,969 --> 02:41:36,670
used it personally yet so but it's a

3664
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:39,059
different kind of silica so and if you

3665
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:42,100
mix it in with almost any of your

3666
02:41:39,059 --> 02:41:43,959
store-bought foliar feeds it really

3667
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:44,569
increases the effectiveness of both

3668
02:41:43,959 --> 02:41:49,100
products

3669
02:41:44,569 --> 02:41:51,289
I can see that sometimes we I have used

3670
02:41:49,101 --> 02:41:52,971
it in conjunction with my integrated

3671
02:41:51,290 --> 02:41:54,860
pest management system and my plants

3672
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:56,930
will love it it kind of helps the

3673
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:58,250
whatever you're putting on the plants it

3674
02:41:56,931 --> 02:41:59,780
helps it stick a little better I think

3675
02:41:58,250 --> 02:42:02,780
too it works like a sticker spreader a

3676
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:04,221
little sweet it's got the consistency of

3677
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:15,079
dish so almost when you open up the

3678
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:17,899
bottle synthetics make some products

3679
02:42:15,079 --> 02:42:19,459
that I would drink if you serve me a cup

3680
02:42:17,899 --> 02:42:30,170
of like if I went to the monta Factor

3681
02:42:19,459 --> 02:42:32,729
and they handed me that what is nectar

3682
02:42:30,170 --> 02:42:36,340
for the god smells kind of good to

3683
02:42:32,729 --> 02:42:38,689

02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:40,310
another brand but I got some samples of

3685
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:47,540
but there's a bunch of molasses in one

3686
02:42:40,310 --> 02:42:49,579
of them together yummy flavor speaking

3687
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:51,590
of that full power you actually can

3688
02:42:49,579 --> 02:42:54,079
drink and it's actually good for you

3689
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:56,229
that's funny yeah it's a it's a humic

3690
02:42:54,079 --> 02:42:59,360
and fulvic they have to label it as

3691
02:42:56,229 --> 02:43:00,739
humic acid but it's actually fulvic acid

3692
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:04,700
alright that has something to do with

3693
02:43:00,739 --> 02:43:06,649
labeling laws but yeah this there's no

3694
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:09,500
warning on it there's no real MSDS for

3695
02:43:06,649 --> 02:43:10,940
it so as I've heard Jeremy from Bill

3696
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:12,739
destroy will talk about drinking it too

3697
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:15,860
that's what kind of got me to research

3698
02:43:12,739 --> 02:43:18,050
it was like this guy's nuts nuts but

3699
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:20,030
he's got a lot of great ideas yeah I

3700
02:43:18,050 --> 02:43:21,500
mean I'm pretty you know he seems like a

3701
02:43:20,030 --> 02:43:24,021
guy concerned about what's going into

3702
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:27,021
his body so most of the Dragonfly earth

3703
02:43:24,021 --> 02:43:30,261
medicine products are guaranteed mostly

3704
02:43:27,021 --> 02:43:31,159
just alfalfa and one such good stuff if

3705
02:43:30,261 --> 02:43:33,590
you need Brutes

3706
02:43:31,159 --> 02:43:34,851
use that lush roots just take your

3707
02:43:33,590 --> 02:43:36,620
little baby clones where the roots are

3708
02:43:34,851 --> 02:43:38,150
showing and just roll the clones in that

3709
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:42,280
lush roots and then put them in the soil

3710
02:43:38,149 --> 02:43:42,279
and don't just go be rootbound day

3711
02:43:42,290 --> 02:43:47,860
fazt flowers is a good one too okay I've

3712
02:43:45,079 --> 02:43:50,809
run too big of a crop for the price of

3713
02:43:47,860 --> 02:43:54,890
definitely that's for a boutique grower

3714
02:43:50,809 --> 02:43:57,079
for sure for something insect frass is

3715
02:43:54,889 --> 02:43:58,639
amazing but we could never use it at

3716
02:43:57,079 --> 02:44:01,100
either one of our works because it's

3717
02:43:58,639 --> 02:44:03,859
different it's the price it would take

3718
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:06,530
to make you know 300 gallons once a week

3719
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:08,210
of this ridiculous

3720
02:44:06,530 --> 02:44:10,370
I can only give a shout-out to a product

3721
02:44:08,209 --> 02:44:12,979
but I'm not sure yeah let's go for it

3722
02:44:10,370 --> 02:44:15,160
big-time exterminator it seems to be

3723
02:44:12,979 --> 02:44:15,159
working

3724
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:18,950
exterminators comes in a black bottle

3725
02:44:17,629 --> 02:44:21,679
with a skull on it this is big-time

3726
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:24,050
exterminator on it it's pretty red it's

3727
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:26,420
mostly organic and it's approved by the

3728
02:44:24,049 --> 02:44:29,270
meed rules which is very important very

3729
02:44:26,420 --> 02:44:31,489
important and I feel like I've been

3730
02:44:29,271 --> 02:44:33,470
adapting I run a personal home drove a

3731
02:44:31,489 --> 02:44:35,209
caregiver grove for my patients which is

3732
02:44:33,469 --> 02:44:36,829
all legal and legit and I can do

3733
02:44:35,209 --> 02:44:39,259
whatever I want there's no nobody looks

3734
02:44:36,829 --> 02:44:44,959
at it but I adapted the same Emmy DeRose

3735
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:47,300
to my personal grow there's no need for

3736
02:44:44,959 --> 02:44:49,729
me to and it keeps me learning here also

3737
02:44:47,299 --> 02:44:50,270
yeah it keeps me prepared for both

3738
02:44:49,729 --> 02:44:55,659
places

3739
02:44:50,271 --> 02:44:58,700
my wife Bernadette my life my life she's

3740
02:44:55,659 --> 02:45:00,049
been studying that list very good and

3741
02:44:58,700 --> 02:45:02,420
getting to know pesticides I'm actually

3742
02:45:00,049 --> 02:45:04,670
really proud of her job shout out to

3743
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:06,979
burn she has had growers from some of

3744
02:45:04,670 --> 02:45:08,809
our clients calling her and asking her

3745
02:45:06,979 --> 02:45:10,430
about stuff and what they can use in

3746
02:45:08,809 --> 02:45:12,409
what they can't use cuz she knows more

3747
02:45:10,430 --> 02:45:16,040
about it than the head grower for these

3748
02:45:12,409 --> 02:45:18,319
gigantic grows so the email out lists to

3749
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:25,370
everybody at metric oh yeah I get a list

3750
02:45:18,319 --> 02:45:27,469
of all the new pesticide yeah she's

3751
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:30,010
actually she tried calling the Med to

3752
02:45:27,469 --> 02:45:33,139
talk to him about it one day and a

3753
02:45:30,010 --> 02:45:36,319
certain lady with her name starts with

3754
02:45:33,139 --> 02:45:39,409
an M called her back and was not cool at

3755
02:45:36,319 --> 02:45:41,270
all but then we called the department

3756
02:45:39,409 --> 02:45:42,680
agriculture and she ended up spending

3757
02:45:41,271 --> 02:45:44,480
about an hour on the phone with a lady

3758
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:46,790
those days are super cool the Department

3759
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:48,649
of Ag is really good I hope they're the

3760
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:50,810
people that actually regulate us one day

3761
02:45:48,649 --> 02:45:52,279
that's one of my hopes and dreams

3762
02:45:50,809 --> 02:45:53,840
Gary had some great points on the show

3763
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:54,199
that we recorded last night that hasn't

3764
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:55,728
been

3765
02:45:54,199 --> 02:45:56,959
least yet of everybody that listens to

3766
02:45:55,728 --> 02:45:58,038
the show is hurted by now but and you'll

3767
02:45:56,959 --> 02:45:59,149
hear it but there are some great things

3768
02:45:58,039 --> 02:46:00,890
that kind of go along with that

3769
02:45:59,148 --> 02:46:05,118
statement it'll be entertaining

3770
02:46:00,889 --> 02:46:08,889
so powdery mildew we getting rid of that

3771
02:46:05,119 --> 02:46:11,930
remind me again mix it up some spray yes

3772
02:46:08,889 --> 02:46:13,368
tea all over the plants yeah it'll

3773
02:46:11,930 --> 02:46:15,109
disrupt the pH okay I want to make sure

3774
02:46:13,369 --> 02:46:16,640
that we covered that one I bet adding

3775
02:46:15,109 --> 02:46:19,009
some silica to that tea to help raise

3776
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:21,738
the pH even more probably be real kill

3777
02:46:19,009 --> 02:46:24,619
time exterminator with some 28 in there

3778
02:46:21,738 --> 02:46:28,218
yeah really really effective on p.m. is

3779
02:46:24,619 --> 02:46:29,748
what I would a big time exterminator we

3780
02:46:28,218 --> 02:46:38,628
have it at the store but I've never used

3781
02:46:29,748 --> 02:46:40,988
really yeah big-time big-time

3782
02:46:38,629 --> 02:46:43,159
roots big-time inoculate yeah that's

3783
02:46:40,988 --> 02:46:44,600
there you should see the store they just

3784
02:46:43,158 --> 02:46:45,949
a good shout out those are good products

3785
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:47,509
I like the big time there's one with

3786
02:46:45,949 --> 02:46:50,390
coconut oil and some other things in it

3787
02:46:47,509 --> 02:46:52,520
I really approve of that one alright so

3788
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:54,378
if you guys do here's another side note

3789
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:56,689
if you do have buds that have powdery

3790
02:46:54,379 --> 02:46:57,439
mildew on them I know it sounds like the

3791
02:46:56,689 --> 02:47:00,259
easy way out

3792
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:02,359
do not blast them and turn them into BHO

3793
02:47:00,259 --> 02:47:04,369
please no please don't do that don't

3794
02:47:02,359 --> 02:47:05,479
press them and turn them into rosin we

3795
02:47:04,369 --> 02:47:17,328
don't want to taste your burnt popcorn

3796
02:47:05,478 --> 02:47:19,218
and powdery mildew everybody learned how

3797
02:47:17,328 --> 02:47:26,718
to make BHO nobody gets powdery mildew

3798
02:47:19,218 --> 02:47:29,179
any more we got no we have a whole bunch

3799
02:47:26,718 --> 02:47:30,618
of shatter that's what you see now and I

3800
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:33,799
know a few people they think it's safe

3801
02:47:30,619 --> 02:47:35,899
yeah I can okay

3802
02:47:33,799 --> 02:47:37,879
here's I'm not a scientist I'm not a

3803
02:47:35,898 --> 02:47:39,378
chemistry student I'm not this is I'm

3804
02:47:37,879 --> 02:47:41,689
not qualified to give this speech but

3805
02:47:39,379 --> 02:47:43,939
this is what I understand about the idea

3806
02:47:41,689 --> 02:47:47,689
of blasting powdery mildew covered buds

3807
02:47:43,939 --> 02:47:49,699
ah some folks say that the PM will not

3808
02:47:47,689 --> 02:47:51,229
get through the screen good enough if it

3809
02:47:49,699 --> 02:47:52,369
doesn't maybe it won't maybe it'll stay

3810
02:47:51,228 --> 02:47:53,809
in the tube maybe it's right there

3811
02:47:52,369 --> 02:47:55,100
pressed up against the screen just like

3812
02:47:53,809 --> 02:47:56,269
your coffee and it's not getting through

3813
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:58,189
and all your coffee is coming through

3814
02:47:56,270 --> 02:48:00,498
but what is coming through

3815
02:47:58,189 --> 02:48:02,539
maybe not the spores and not the mildew

3816
02:48:00,498 --> 02:48:04,158
but there are mycotoxins inside of those

3817
02:48:02,539 --> 02:48:05,838
spores that have been extracted just

3818
02:48:04,158 --> 02:48:06,959
like your cannabinoids and your terpenes

3819
02:48:05,838 --> 02:48:08,520
they've been washed

3820
02:48:06,959 --> 02:48:11,159
so you're getting the mycotoxins which

3821
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:13,739
are going to affect you in the long run

3822
02:48:11,159 --> 02:48:15,659
if you if you inhale the spores

3823
02:48:13,739 --> 02:48:16,860
you'll get that sooner you'll get an

3824
02:48:15,659 --> 02:48:19,289
infection in your lungs who get an

3825
02:48:16,860 --> 02:48:20,940
irritation the mycotoxins are gonna take

3826
02:48:19,290 --> 02:48:22,080
a little while to and infect your body

3827
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:23,310
and it's gonna be different gonna have

3828
02:48:22,079 --> 02:48:24,899
fungus inside your body you know

3829
02:48:23,309 --> 02:48:25,859
mycotoxins running around inside your

3830
02:48:24,899 --> 02:48:28,409
lungs now they're gonna get in your

3831
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:30,300
bloodstream I'm not a doctor I don't

3832
02:48:28,409 --> 02:48:32,670
know enough about that but I do know

3833
02:48:30,299 --> 02:48:34,228
that it's not a good idea because you're

3834
02:48:32,670 --> 02:48:36,420
just washing the mycotoxins off the

3835
02:48:34,228 --> 02:48:37,829
mildew into your hash and then people

3836
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:39,420
are gonna make edibles out of that hash

3837
02:48:37,829 --> 02:48:41,370
some times and they're gonna consume

3838
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:42,629
that [ __ ] and they're gonna smoke it

3839
02:48:41,370 --> 02:48:44,040
this is supposed to be something that

3840
02:48:42,629 --> 02:48:46,589
improves the quality of people's lives

3841
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:48,750
not makes us thicker not [ __ ] us up so

3842
02:48:46,590 --> 02:48:49,969
please do not blast your powdery mildew

3843
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:53,610
buds the only thing that I recommend

3844
02:48:49,969 --> 02:48:55,379
I've never done this shoutout to Shawn

3845
02:48:53,610 --> 02:48:56,520
and Jordan that's all their I don't know

3846
02:48:55,379 --> 02:48:58,228
what else to call them Shawn and Jordan

3847
02:48:56,520 --> 02:49:03,329
some friends of mine they say that you

3848
02:48:58,228 --> 02:49:05,489
can take the 30% hydrogen peroxide and

3849
02:49:03,329 --> 02:49:07,379
put it in distilled water and you can

3850
02:49:05,489 --> 02:49:11,219
mix that up and they say you can dunk

3851
02:49:07,379 --> 02:49:12,750
your p.m. covered buds or PM dosed buds

3852
02:49:11,219 --> 02:49:14,789
in that and then hang them up and they

3853
02:49:12,750 --> 02:49:21,209
will dry and that will cure your powdery

3854
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:22,620
mildew problem if anybody has done that

3855
02:49:21,209 --> 02:49:24,119
email me it's grow from your heart at

3856
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:26,130
hotmail.com I'd love to hear what your

3857
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:29,340
experience about with that on that

3858
02:49:26,129 --> 02:49:31,349
subject I've heard that you can wash

3859
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:33,510
your buds in the exact same way like

3860
02:49:31,350 --> 02:49:36,059
your outdoor boats to wash the dirts and

3861
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:38,280
stuff off of them yeah doing that exact

3862
02:49:36,059 --> 02:49:42,000
same thing but without the hydrogen

3863
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:44,159
peroxide okay done that let Jeff know

3864
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,569
about that too because I'd like to hear

3865
02:49:44,159 --> 02:49:47,789
I had a friend named Donovan who was

3866
02:49:45,569 --> 02:49:49,529
known as DJ tanki Online back in the day

3867
02:49:47,790 --> 02:49:51,930
he I don't know if I supposed to say his

3868
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:54,600
real name in his Don line doesn't exist

3869
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:56,190
anymore so we're cool he used to say

3870
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:57,960
that he would rinse his buds off just

3871
02:49:56,190 --> 02:49:59,250
like a week before harvest he'd just go

3872
02:49:57,959 --> 02:50:00,599
in there and rinse him off at the spray

3873
02:49:59,250 --> 02:50:02,610
bottle and hose him down just to get all

3874
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:05,010
the dust off of him huh which is a good

3875
02:50:02,610 --> 02:50:06,690
idea because in my opinion all that dust

3876
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:08,399
that you kick up during the grossie's

3877
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:10,500
and all that it's been windy as [ __ ] out

3878
02:50:08,399 --> 02:50:12,149
oh yeah people got plants out if it's

3879
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:13,530
this windy in the middle of the

3880
02:50:12,149 --> 02:50:15,270
flowering season people are gonna have

3881
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:15,950
buds that are just covered in dirt on

3882
02:50:15,270 --> 02:50:18,649
one side

3883
02:50:15,950 --> 02:50:20,210
yeah that's going into your hash yeah

3884
02:50:18,649 --> 02:50:26,930
then you're just gonna blast that right

3885
02:50:20,209 --> 02:50:30,039
into the pot of gold right there yeah is

3886
02:50:26,930 --> 02:50:30,040
a good idea in this region

3887
02:50:30,469 --> 02:50:36,109
it sounds lazy but in my personal grow

3888
02:50:32,750 --> 02:50:37,700
room I quit sweeping around week six the

3889
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:39,829
buds are getting sticky everything's

3890
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:42,950
real sticky and I don't want to stir up

3891
02:50:39,829 --> 02:50:45,110
any dust or dirt off of the floor into

3892
02:50:42,950 --> 02:50:50,050
those buds so I will let it get kind of

3893
02:50:45,110 --> 02:50:52,460
funky from about snacks or anything but

3894
02:50:50,049 --> 02:50:54,500
you spill soil when you kick pots

3895
02:50:52,459 --> 02:50:56,329
occasionally and [ __ ] happens

3896
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:58,639
but I won't sweep sometimes from like

3897
02:50:56,329 --> 02:51:00,350
weeks six or seven until after harvest

3898
02:50:58,639 --> 02:51:01,760
or at the end of harvest oh I'll cut off

3899
02:51:00,350 --> 02:51:05,600
all the leaves pre harvest and then

3900
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:07,010
sweep up and cut down the plants

3901
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:09,590
pre-harvest cut down the plants and then

3902
02:51:07,010 --> 02:51:13,180
sweep up and clean up I start fresh the

3903
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:13,180
whole room with hydrogen peroxide water

3904
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:18,110
clean it up redo the flooring fix all

3905
02:51:16,219 --> 02:51:19,699
the ducting that should be a whole

3906
02:51:18,110 --> 02:51:21,110
episode what to do between grows we

3907
02:51:19,700 --> 02:51:26,180
could probably talk for six weeks about

3908
02:51:21,110 --> 02:51:28,159
that oh yeah untouched subject a lot so

3909
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:29,630
yeah so we've been doing for about 40

3910
02:51:28,159 --> 02:51:31,879
minutes dude I think we gave the folks a

3911
02:51:29,629 --> 02:51:33,709
decent start all we did was tell them

3912
02:51:31,879 --> 02:51:35,209
how to mix up some soil so dig some big

3913
02:51:33,709 --> 02:51:36,500
holes and put all that stuff inside of

3914
02:51:35,209 --> 02:51:40,399
it and then put your little baby plants

3915
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:42,500
in there I'm about May 15th to June 5th

3916
02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:44,420
ish yeah and then keep an eye on them

3917
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:47,780
keep them watered decently just real

3918
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:50,149
quick do your soil at least two weeks

3919
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:53,110
before I cover the top of the holes

3920
02:51:50,149 --> 02:51:57,559
plastic that helps accelerate the

3921
02:51:53,110 --> 02:51:59,750
composting process of the of the Rodman

3922
02:51:57,559 --> 02:52:05,090
mints being broken down and being plant

3923
02:51:59,750 --> 02:52:06,350
available earthworms are great yeah

3924
02:52:05,090 --> 02:52:07,850
throw some worms and then if you can't

3925
02:52:06,350 --> 02:52:10,670
mulching is awesome

3926
02:52:07,850 --> 02:52:12,710
Oh your hole size do you know it kind of

3927
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:15,219
depends on you know the size of your

3928
02:52:12,709 --> 02:52:19,549
plant and and how big it can get but a

3929
02:52:15,219 --> 02:52:21,109
at least 3x3 hole and you only need to

3930
02:52:19,549 --> 02:52:23,899
go with cannabis you only need to go

3931
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:24,819
down about 18 inches there's no need to

3932
02:52:23,899 --> 02:52:26,828
try to

3933
02:52:24,818 --> 02:52:29,469
[ __ ] six-foot hole full of highly

3934
02:52:26,828 --> 02:52:31,270
enriched soil um I think it's expensive

3935
02:52:29,469 --> 02:52:33,698
quickly yeah it's just a lot of work and

3936
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:37,569
it gets really expensive yeah go get you
