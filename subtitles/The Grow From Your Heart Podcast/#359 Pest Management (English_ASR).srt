them at dank seed dot store I like to

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,439
start the podcast off by letting you

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,480
know what I'm smoking today I'm taking

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,599
dabs of bubble Jack full-spectrum

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,579
extract from Fuego extracts I really

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,420
love the flavor and aroma of this

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,969
concentrate

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,039
it smells like Jack Herer and bubblegum

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,230
and when you dab it it leaves a sweet

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,600
soft bubblegum flavor on your mouth that

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,849
just lingers for a long time and the

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,010
high goes straight to the head I really

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,600
like this concentrate one thing I am

21
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,909
going to complain about is the packaging

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,189
these little plastic jars get stuck the

23
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,259
Fuego jars get stuck every time I buy

24
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,659
them it is a pain in the ass then

25
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,238
they're putting the jar inside of a

26
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,819
black bag with a drawstring kind of like

27
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,769
a little tiny Crown Royal bag the jar

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,618
has stickers on it to indicate the brand

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,510
and the strain the little black bag has

30
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,670
a bunch of fibers that come off of it so

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,430
now I've got a jar that looks like it's

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,409
got long black hairs hanging off of it I

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,030
don't like that at all it's unappealing

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,368
there's no need for that bag it's a

35
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,019
waste of material it's another step in

36
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,209
the packaging process and it is

37
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,429
completely useless then after they've

38
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,469
put the jar in that bag they place that

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,150
bag inside of another box which slides

40
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,188
into another box which is all

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,170
beautifully decorated and well labeled

42
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,758
it is a lot of packaging I'm sure most

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,859
of that packaging is because of the

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,390
Colorado compliance laws but I would

45
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,769
like to see less packaging from the

46
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,320
concentrate companies I feel like I

47
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,640
throw away a lot of packaging alright

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,859
you guys so let me be completely clear

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,750
the concentrate is amazing the bubble

50
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,938
Jack full-spectrum extract tastes great

51
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,129
the high is perfect my only complaint is

52
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,019
with the packaging and that is not just

53
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,578
Flay go I just happened to be using

54
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,589
fuego products today when I'm talking

55
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,269
about this a lot of the companies are

56
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,579
using too much packaging and I

57
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,328
understand it's Colorado law we've got

58
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,099
to be compliant

59
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,048
I get it I just wish there was a way we

60
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,449
could do this more efficiently and more

61
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,979
environmentally friendly all right guys

62
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,378
let's move forward with the show this is

63
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,509
going to be another grow lesson this is

64
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,818
going to be the seventh lesson in a long

65
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:15,798
series of grow less

66
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:18,158
in this episode I want to talk about

67
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,239
planning your integrated pest management

68
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:21,979
everybody likes to think they will not

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,989
get bugs everybody likes to say that's

70
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,090
not gonna happen to me but guess what it

71
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:28,128
will and the only way you can prevent it

72
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,560
is by starting an integrated pest

73
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,969
management system while your planning or

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,039
grow while you're setting up your grow

75
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:35,959
and having it in place before you ever

76
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,419
introduce plants into your grow

77
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,430
environment now let's talk a little bit

78
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,229
about integrated pest management what is

79
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,329
the goal of our integrated pest

80
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,848
management system the ultimate goal is

81
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,670
to keep our garden free of pests and

82
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:51,979
bugs a good spot to start would be

83
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,289
knowing how to identify the bugs we are

84
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,238
looking for and the damage that they

85
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,090
will leave now what insects are we going

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,219
to find in our cannabis garden the most

87
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,400
common problem we are going to find is

88
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:07,280
spider mites spider mites are very small

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,139
you are very unlikely to see a spider

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,908
mite unless you flip over a leaf and

91
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,760
look at it and do some investigating

92
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:15,438
what you will see is spider mite damage

93
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,969
if you've got a leaf that looks like

94
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:19,189
somebody has just been taking a needle

95
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,658
and poking little dots in that leaf or

96
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,859
something's been sticking its fangs in

97
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,500
there and sucking the juice out of those

98
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,650
little spots that is spider mite damage

99
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,199
learn how to identify spider mite damage

100
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,060
if you see damage on a leaf pull that

101
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,190
leaf off flip it upside down and look at

102
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,930
the underside of the leaf along the main

103
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,759
vein of that leaf tucked right up

104
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,010
against that vein you will see spider

105
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,989
mites and spider my eggs those little

106
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,698
dots you see those are spider mite eggs

107
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,709
those little itty bitty dots that are

108
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,930
moving those are the spider mites they

109
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,969
are there it is time to treat for them

110
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,949
depending on what cycle of growth you

111
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:54,109
are in treating for spider mites can be

112
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,540
very easy it can also be kind of a pain

113
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,669
in the ass later in Flour if you learn

114
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,198
how to identify spider my damage and

115
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,510
learn how to identify spider mites

116
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,280
finding the problem early and correcting

117
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,298
it should not be a problem before it

118
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,579
gets out of hand

119
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,438
another pest that is very common in the

120
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,680
garden and very easy to identify because

121
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,568
of its damage is a thrip a lot like a

122
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,579
spider mite the thrips like to suck the

123
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:18,529
juice out of our plants after they do

124
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,658
this they leave a little trail of gooey

125
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,209
stuff called honeydew on the leaves if

126
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:25,218
you see a little trail of silvery shiny

127
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,000
shimmery stuff left on your lower leaves

128
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:28,949
you probably have

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,899
trips if we become familiar with what

130
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,969
thrift damage looks like we can identify

131
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,759
the problem sooner and that makes it

132
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,770
really easy to eradicate our problems so

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,289
my point is knowing what to look for

134
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,750
will be seriously advantageous when it

135
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,790
comes to treating for a pest problem

136
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,250
another common pest you're going to run

137
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,660
into is the white fly what does a white

138
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,670
fly look like it looks like a little

139
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,350
piece of ash just flying around just a

140
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,850
little white fly it'll start off with

141
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,830
two of them then the next day you'll see

142
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,410
200 of them then the next day you'll see

143
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,229
2,000 of them white flies multiply

144
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,810
rapidly but once you see them they are

145
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,020
easy to get rid of if you understand how

146
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,030
to combat them so the very first step of

147
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,849
an integrated pest management system is

148
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,849
learning to identify the damage caused

149
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,710
by common garden pests once we know how

150
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,050
to identify the problems then we can

151
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,089
identify the pest then we can decide on

152
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,210
the course of action to treat that

153
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:26,849
problem also it is very important to

154
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:28,859
treat for the correct pest some

155
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,379
pesticides will work on a broad spectrum

156
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,270
of pests but if you are using specific

157
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,668
pesticides or if you're using specific

158
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:38,490
predatory pests you do need to use the

159
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,918
correct method of attack in today's

160
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,930
market we can't afford to spend money on

161
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,509
a product that does not specifically

162
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,579
attack our problem and also we can't

163
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,589
spend time applying a product or

164
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,389
releasing predators that are not going

165
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,939
to get in there and eradicate our

166
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,789
problems so learn how to identify the

167
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,490
signs then identify the actual pests

168
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,650
then we can dial in an attack to

169
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,660
eradicate our problem now let's talk

170
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,029
about a few ways we can prepare our grow

171
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,910
and prevent pests from entering our new

172
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:10,529
garden cleanliness is a huge factor when

173
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,390
it comes to keeping bugs out of our

174
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,969
garden everything that goes in that

175
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,500
garden is taken in there by you you

176
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,700
travel in and out of there you take

177
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,339
things in and out it is your

178
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:23,099
responsibility to control what goes in

179
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,019
and out of that grow one way to prevent

180
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,350
contaminating your garden is to have a

181
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,149
dedicated garden clothes don't come from

182
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,160
a hike don't come from the gross store

183
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,750
don't come from work don't go from

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,169
wherever you are into your grow room

185
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,389
have specific garden clothes change your

186
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:40,039
clothes change your shoes change your

187
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,050
hat

188
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,120
don't take your daily clothing into your

189
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,920
grow room who knows what's on you

190
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,720
maybe you've been petting a dog maybe

191
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,199
the dog was outside leaning against the

192
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,540
tree

193
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,639
maybe that tree had a fits that dog came

194
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,600
in rubbed up against your leg you and

195
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,430
the dog spent a minute together

196
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,930
scratching on each other then you went

197
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,000
to the grow you just took those aphids

198
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,040
from the tree to the dog into your

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,810
garden tried to prevent that sort of

200
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,629
thing be very careful

201
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,790
I've got dreadlocks down to my knees I

202
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,459
wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat

203
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,830
before I go into any grow if you've got

204
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,019
dreadlocks or long hair I suggest you

205
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,759
put it in a hat of some sort maybe a

206
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,949
hairnet whatever it takes my hair would

207
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,990
not fit in a hairnet I wrap my dreads in

208
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,579
a big bun on top of my head I wrap that

209
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,500
in a piece of material that wraps real

210
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:26,449
tight then I slide a dreadlock hat over

211
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,279
that so I'm double wrapped nothing will

212
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,139
get in nothing will get out I won't

213
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,479
transfer any problems from grow to grow

214
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,219
or room-to-room so if you've got

215
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,930
dreadlocks or long hair I highly

216
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,670
recommend you keep it wrapped up maybe

217
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,290
in a hairnet or something similar maybe

218
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,240
add Red Hat just where it's contained in

219
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,100
there and not exposed that way you can

220
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,990
prevent moving spider mites around

221
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,310
through your hair and some of you guys

222
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,009
with the big beards you may want to

223
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,810
consider a beard net also not just to

224
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,909
prevent the bugs from getting into our

225
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,620
hair but also to prevent our hair from

226
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,230
sticking to the buds nobody wants to buy

227
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,790
a bud with a big hair in it so change

228
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,350
your clothes keep your hair tied up and

229
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,390
then let's get back to that dog I was

230
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,189
talking about I don't recommend having

231
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,689
pets in the grow room I see a lot of

232
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,339
pictures of people with their dog or

233
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,079
their cat in the grow room talking about

234
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,149
it's there their guard dog or their

235
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,189
mascot that's cool if you want to do

236
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:15,289
that but I don't recommend it like I

237
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,269
said earlier your dog or your cat goes

238
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,379
outside it rolls around in the dirt it

239
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:20,750
rolls around in the bushes

240
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:22,759
it just goes everywhere who knows what

241
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,740
it's getting into then you let it walk

242
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,060
right into the garden maybe it walked up

243
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,620
right up against a plant that was

244
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,160
covered in spider mites and you had no

245
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,379
idea

246
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,360
now that dog is in your garden rubbing

247
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:35,090
up against your plants guess what

248
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,860
free spider mites for everybody I don't

249
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,840
recommend having a pet in the grow if

250
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,659
you insist do your thing that is your

251
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,849
grow but in my opinion that is a huge

252
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,009
risk for bringing bugs into your garden

253
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,810
another thing I would recommend is that

254
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,000
if you've got an outdoor grow and an

255
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:52,069
indoor grow don't bring your tools from

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,049
that outdoor grow into your indoor grow

257
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,270
environment you may be bringing

258
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:57,769
and sometimes I know I sound like I

259
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,419
might just be paranoid but it's better

260
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,759
to be paranoid than to make stupid

261
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:03,289
mistakes now as long as you're changing

262
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,970
your clothes you're keeping your hair

263
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:06,259
clean you're keeping your shoes and your

264
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,820
equipment clean and you're not letting

265
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:09,559
your dog or your friends in your grow

266
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,020
room there shouldn't be a way for any

267
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,609
pest to get into this grow you may have

268
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,809
some cracks in the walls there may be

269
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,000
gaps in your building

270
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,559
that's always gonna happen but we're not

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,450
going to drag them in there on our own

272
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,339
if they find a way in we will deal with

273
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,080
that now once you're certain you've

274
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,660
minimized the opportunity for pests to

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,340
entry or grow through your own doing we

276
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,169
need to think about treating the clones

277
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,480
that come into our grow before they are

278
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,889
introduced to population wherever your

279
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,810
clones come from if it's your best

280
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,789
friend if it's a dispensary if it's some

281
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:40,789
guy on Instagram wherever they came from

282
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:43,099
treat them as if they are contaminated

283
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,019
with some sort of pest issue never

284
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,879
introduce clones into your general

285
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,370
population without some sort of

286
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,110
quarantine period if your room is brand

287
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,240
new you don't have bugs

288
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,580
why take plants in there that have bugs

289
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,190
on them we can treat those plants before

290
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,230
we take them into our main grow room if

291
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,180
you've got a room with plants going why

292
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,279
would you want to introduce a plant with

293
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:07,009
bugs on it into that room to contaminate

294
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,259
the entire grow if you get clones from

295
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,480
anybody isolate them quarantine them

296
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,309
investigate them get a jeweler's loupe

297
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,620
and go over the leaves and see if you

298
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,109
can see any signs of bugs on the top or

299
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,480
bottoms of those leaves if you see any

300
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,250
pests now you have to decide if you want

301
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,930
to keep that clone or if you're going to

302
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,149
treat it and try to eradicate that

303
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,639
problem before you introduce that clone

304
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,899
to your general population if I got a

305
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,639
clone that had bugs on it I would

306
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,350
probably throw it away unless it were

307
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,509
some super elite cut that I could never

308
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,040
get again why start with problems

309
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,590
I wouldn't even allow that to make it

310
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,839
past quarantine if it looked like it was

311
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,280
clean I would still probably treat it I

312
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,230
would treat it with whatever pest

313
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,329
management system I have decided to work

314
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,220
with if I'm using sprays and oils I

315
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,410
would heavily treat it with multiple

316
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,899
oils several times it would probably

317
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:55,429
spend a week in quarantine the first day

318
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,959
it would get blasted with something on

319
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,519
day three it would get blasted with

320
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,720
something different on day five

321
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,309
something different then we're gonna

322
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,350
look at it if I feel like it's safe and

323
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,659
clean let me enter general population on

324
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,820
day seven or it may get treated one more

325
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,980
time depending on how it looks to me

326
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,410
if I were working in a facility that did

327
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,149
not use spray applications I would put

328
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,740
that plant in an isolated area with

329
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,600
enough light and living conditions to

330
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,669
survive for a few days and then I would

331
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,560
start heavily applying beneficial

332
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:23,269
insects I would build up a colony of

333
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,559
predators on there hopefully they would

334
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,389
go through and eat anything that was

335
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,579
causing me a problem and by day seven I

336
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:31,250
would be safe to enter that clone into

337
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,900
general population but honestly if I got

338
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,789
a clone and it was contaminated I

339
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,110
probably would just destroy it it

340
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,969
wouldn't even make it past the

341
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,490
inspection stage it wouldn't even get

342
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,980
into my Gro so as a grower it is your

343
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,899
responsibility to check incoming clones

344
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,340
and check them thoroughly no matter

345
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,720
where they came from if it came from

346
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,580
your best friend if it came from a

347
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,310
dispensary if it came from somebody on

348
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,590
the internet it is your responsibility

349
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:57,379
you cannot blame anybody for giving you

350
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,139
a clone with bugs that is your fault it

351
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,700
is not their fault so treat any incoming

352
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,370
plants as if they are contaminated

353
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,050
isolate them treat them and continue to

354
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,820
monitor them until you are certain the

355
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,759
problem is not there or has been

356
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,680
eradicated now another very common way

357
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,710
for people to get garden pests is

358
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,689
through store-bought soil or soilless

359
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,450
mix a lot of people try to blame

360
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,570
specific brands for being infested with

361
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,490
specific bugs I find that to be

362
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,410
inaccurate think about it this way brand

363
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,960
a is made in one area in California

364
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:32,329
brand B is probably made in another area

365
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,790
of California and brand C will just say

366
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,320
that it's manufactured in Colorado so

367
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,079
all three of those brands are made then

368
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,730
they're all shipped to a warehouse

369
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,879
sometimes these warehouses store their

370
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,500
soil in pallets outdoors now if one of

371
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,009
those pallets had a little bit of bugs

372
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,169
in it

373
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,450
they started thriving in that one pallet

374
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:52,490
of soil then they moved over to the next

375
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,430
pallet then they moved over to the next

376
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,190
pallet now they are in brands a B and C

377
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,139
there is no way to blame a specific soil

378
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,940
company for giving you bugs it was

379
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:03,799
probably the warehouse in which all of

380
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,660
those pallets were stored is where your

381
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,120
bugs came from so let's try to get away

382
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:10,639
from blaming a specific brand for having

383
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,279
specific bugs in there that's unfair and

384
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,129
probably on a cure it but it is a fact

385
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,439
that our soil does come with bugs quite

386
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,179
frequently a lot of times you'll notice

387
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,500
this when you're transplanting you'll

388
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:23,029
stick your hand in there

389
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,620
a little bug will just fly right up it's

390
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,360
usually a fungus gnat or a white fly

391
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,490
it'll just fly right up out of the soil

392
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,200
you know they're there now it's time to

393
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,500
start thinking about how you are going

394
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,390
to treat for those pests other times you

395
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,669
don't see those soil-borne pests until

396
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,259
the first time you water you just potted

397
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:41,329
all those pots you got a whole bag worth

398
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,649
of soil worth of pots done you feeling

399
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,090
really good about life you got the grow

400
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,949
room all organized you mix up your

401
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,930
nutrients you go to water and that first

402
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,759
batch of water that hits that soil you

403
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:51,500
see a little bugs come flying out those

404
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,210
are fresh bugs they came fresh with the

405
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,309
soil they're not a big deal

406
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,710
as long as we know how to identify the

407
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:00,679
insect and we know how to properly treat

408
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,870
for that problem treating for soil bound

409
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,269
pests is very easy you can either

410
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,129
purchase predator insects that will get

411
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,949
in there and eat that specific pests or

412
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:11,750
we can mix up a root drench which is a

413
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,340
basic pesticide and you mix it with

414
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,659
water and then you water that into the

415
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,759
plants just like you would when you

416
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:18,379
normally water then that pesticide gets

417
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,149
down in there in the root zone and then

418
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,250
it will eradicate any pests that are in

419
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,829
there the things you're most commonly

420
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,960
gonna find in soil are going to be white

421
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,210
flies you'll probably find some fungus

422
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,000
gnats and I quite often have found

423
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,400
thrips in my soil so just know that your

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,559
soil may have bugs in it be aware be

425
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,169
looking and be prepared and once you see

426
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,449
some pests identify them then start

427
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,549
thinking about eradication strategies I

428
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,740
do plan on giving you options for

429
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,569
eradication strategies but I'm not going

430
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,460
to tell you what to do there are

431
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,020
countless options and variables when it

432
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,460
comes to deciding your integrated pest

433
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,980
management but I want to give you

434
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,320
guidance to let you decide and modify

435
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,180
your own pest management system to where

436
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,890
it fits with your grouse style with your

437
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,959
grow environment and also it's got to

438
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,699
fit your budget so I'm gonna give you a

439
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,350
good guideline on how to take care of

440
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,960
pests in your garden but it is up to you

441
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,870
to implement and modify these practices

442
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,339
to work for you alright so we've covered

443
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,289
most of the ways that we are going to

444
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,000
introduce pass into it grow let's talk

445
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,829
about the other ways pests are going to

446
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,570
find their way into the grow they're

447
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,759
gonna come in through your venting and

448
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,770
your ducting if you have any spots that

449
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,689
are not sealed up a spider mite or a

450
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,740
little bug to just wiggle its way right

451
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,050
through there it's gonna smell that

452
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,310
sweet ganja plant it's gonna feel that

453
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,259
warmth from the light and it's gonna go

454
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,429
man I want to be in there and it's gonna

455
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,419
just go that way and then it's gonna

456
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:37,069
tell all of its friends

457
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,379
bro I found a way in and they're just

458
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,960
gonna start parading in so any cracks or

459
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:44,389
gaps in your structure need to be sealed

460
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,470
if you can find a gap or a crack or a

461
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,939
hole of some sort

462
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,920
put some [ __ ] in there put some tape

463
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,450
over it seal it up super tight so that

464
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,459
the bugs cannot get in there

465
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,290
now it's ideal to have a completely

466
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,200
sealed room but I understand that that

467
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:59,179
is not always a viable option since we

468
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,460
do have the opportunity to get bugs in

469
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:03,649
there our next step is to have a way to

470
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,019
monitor and indicate the presence of

471
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,090
pests and the easiest way and most

472
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,819
affordable and cost-effective way to do

473
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,190
that is first by scouting you need to

474
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,830
spend time every day looking through

475
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,430
your garden to see if you see any signs

476
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,860
of bugs or bug damage scouting for bugs

477
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,149
is free it just takes time depending on

478
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,009
the size of your grow this could take

479
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,500
anywhere from five minutes to a full

480
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,120
hour but it is important work put on

481
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,460
some good music get in the zone and

482
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,980
scout for pests train everybody in the

483
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,019
grow how to identify signs of pests and

484
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,060
also teach them how to identify which

485
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,949
pests they're dealing with if you do

486
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:42,529
discover pests have a way to mark the

487
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,240
plant and also mark on paper where it

488
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,429
was in the facility you probably have

489
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,110
row numbers or room numbers or if it's

490
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:49,579
just a home grown as plant number three

491
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,440
or the plant in the middle just kind of

492
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,940
mark down roughly where it is and then

493
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
start thinking of a strategy if you're

494
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,360
not the one in charge of pest management

495
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,220
make sure you report that to the person

496
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,899
above you so just make a note of it

497
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,350
write down what you found what it looks

498
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,909
like

499
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,259
what pests do you think it is and then

500
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:04,430
start doing research on how do we

501
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,190
radical

502
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,380
start coming up with options so scouting

503
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,210
for bugs is free you walk the rows you

504
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,800
turn the leaves upside down you look you

505
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,440
look low in the canopy you look high in

506
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,210
the canopy you look around feel free to

507
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,860
pull a few leaves off if you can't get a

508
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,630
good look reach in there pop off a few

509
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,729
leaves look at those under your scope

510
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,980
see if you see anything you should be

511
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,349
scouting for pests on a regular basis

512
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,089
with some sort of a strategy now while

513
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,609
you're out scouting for pests you should

514
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:34,279
check your yellow sticky cards every

515
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,019
grow should have yellow sticky cards and

516
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,440
they should be checked frequently and

517
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:41,509
changed frequently as well yellow sticky

518
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,340
cards are exactly what I'm saying there

519
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:45,470
are little yellow cards there are about

520
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,509
4 inches by 4 inches or maybe 4 inches

521
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,190
by 6 inches and they are bright yellow

522
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:50,809
and they are sticky

523
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,700
a disgusting glue on him that if you

524
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,049
touch it it's gonna take all day to get

525
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,430
that stuff off of you don't get one

526
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,960
stuck to your elbow when you're working

527
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,370
in the grow if you've done it you know

528
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,930
exactly what I'm talking about when you

529
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,939
do it you'll go ah that's what he meant

530
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,400
but you should have yellow sticky traps

531
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,950
all over the grow I like to put yellow

532
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,570
sticky traps low down by the soil so

533
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,710
that if I get any soil bound pests

534
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:11,720
coming up out of the dirt

535
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,789
I get indicators of that I like to put

536
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,069
yellow sticky traps low in the canopy so

537
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,059
if I get any low flying stuff I get

538
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,769
indicators of that

539
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,509
I'll put stuff at the top of the canopy

540
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,250
and then I'll also put stuff up near the

541
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,410
light so that if anything flies into it

542
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,660
I get an indicator of that and that is a

543
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,840
really easy way to find out that you

544
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,370
have got insects bugs love those yellow

545
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,379
sticky traps they say wow look how

546
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:35,089
bright that is that's a leaf that is

547
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,680
weak that's a leaf that's got a weak

548
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,089
surface that I can get in there and

549
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,830
really start sucking the juice out of

550
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,329
without a lot of effort I want to go to

551
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,460
that so the bugs run to that yellow

552
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,230
sticky trap and they go oh [ __ ] this is

553
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,150
yellow sticky trap I'm stuck here and

554
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,039
then we come in in the morning and we

555
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,960
get to find out what kind of bugs were

556
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,549
messing around in the garden having a

557
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
party while we were at home trying to

558
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,279
get some rest

559
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,229
yellow sticky traps are really

560
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,869
affordable and they are a really early

561
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,849
indicator of the presence of pests so

562
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:04,189
hang up your sticky traps check them on

563
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,139
a daily basis if you start seeing things

564
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,870
stuck to them investigate what that pest

565
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,970
is and tree accordingly then hang up

566
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,649
fresh sticky traps and see if that

567
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,600
problem has gone away or if it has

568
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,130
gotten worse or if anything new pops up

569
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,869
but if you're going to use the yellow

570
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,670
sticky traps there has to be some sort

571
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,559
of method to your madness you have to

572
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,420
hang them strategically you have to

573
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,190
check them and you have to replace them

574
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,860
and if you see something you have to

575
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,930
react accordingly so now we have two

576
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:32,059
methods of finding bugs in our garden we

577
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,830
can use our own vision from scouting and

578
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,440
then we can use yellow sticky traps to

579
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:37,819
assist us our next step is to learn to

580
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,039
use our integrated pest management

581
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:42,230
system to continue to prevent

582
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,200
infestations and we also need to learn

583
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,660
what to do if a pest infestation should

584
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,789
occur in a strategic pest management

585
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,340
system it's always wise to have

586
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,680
preventive measures in place why wait

587
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:56,899
until we've got bugs to start treating

588
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,509
for bugs let's make it uncomfortable and

589
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,090
undesirable for the pests we know may

590
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:02,539
arrive now before we talk about options

591
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,970
let

592
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:07,609
talk a little bit about ethics you can

593
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,309
choose predator bugs you can choose

594
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:12,769
organic sprays you can choose harsh

595
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:16,480
chemical sprays whatever you choose to

596
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:19,190
treat your garden is up to you I

597
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,620
encourage you to use something safe

598
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,049
is it safe to you is it safe to the

599
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:26,599
consumer is it safe to your pets and is

600
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,639
it overall safe to our environment if

601
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,199
you're gonna smoke it yourself spray

602
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,180
whatever you are comfortable with

603
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,769
spraying on your garden that's yours you

604
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,450
can do whatever you want I probably

605
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,549
don't want to smoke it if you sprayed it

606
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,529
with a few things but if it's yours and

607
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,119
you're sure it's not going anywhere you

608
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,940
can treat it however you are comfortable

609
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,069
if you have other consumers that are

610
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,650
going to consume your product keep their

611
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:51,139
health and safety in mind not everybody

612
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,750
is a young healthy person some people

613
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,480
may have underlying health issues that

614
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,910
may be exacerbated by a pesticide or an

615
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,890
essential oil or a botanical oil keep

616
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,920
other people in mind if you are going to

617
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,440
share sell or dispense your product in

618
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,880
any sort of way then of course please

619
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,880
make sure that your pest management

620
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,260
system is environmentally friendly we

621
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,480
also need to keep in mind to be

622
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:17,119
long-term effects of whatever we choose

623
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,220
to use beneficial mites will have a

624
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,289
long-term environmental effect but it is

625
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,940
a much gentler effect than if we

626
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,730
wouldn't outside and sprayed harsh

627
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,370
chemicals so think about long-term think

628
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,559
about exposure not just to the plants

629
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:32,869
the environment the soil your neighbors

630
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,759
gardens but also to yourself you've got

631
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:37,219
to apply those chemicals or pesticides

632
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,829
or botanical oils think about if they're

633
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,150
going to harm you over time also think

634
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,980
about this is something we don't think

635
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,080
about often enough here but I'm trying

636
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,630
to gear myself more toward think about

637
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,519
the ethics of the company that makes the

638
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,440
products you were using does that

639
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,599
company care do they care about the

640
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,279
environment do they care about people do

641
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,799
they care about cannabis are they

642
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,389
opposed to cannabis there are some

643
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,220
companies out there that make products

644
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,700
that are available at the hydro store

645
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:07,370
that are completely opposed to cannabis

646
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,200
and cannabis legalization why would we

647
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,569
buy those products to support those

648
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,259
people so when it comes to selecting a

649
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:16,549
pesticide understand the company

650
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:18,500
understand the product you're buying

651
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,119
understand the active ingredient and

652
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,460
understand the effects of that

653
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,379
ingredient in the long term understand

654
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,759
what it's doing to yourself understand

655
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,800
what it's doing to your consumers and

656
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,750
try to understand what it does to the

657
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,549
environment and then really think about

658
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,079
if that's something you can support if

659
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,579
that is something you would be proud to

660
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,349
see you did if that is something you

661
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,819
would stand behind and if you're proud

662
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,259
of it if you can support it and you'd

663
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,759
put your signature on it go ahead and

664
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,589
use that product do what you're

665
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,150
comfortable with so now let's talk a

666
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:45,349
little bit more about preventative

667
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,870
that's where I was headed with all of

668
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:49,849
that preventive measures it's okay to

669
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:51,859
start treating for a pest problem before

670
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,389
you see a pest problem why wouldn't we

671
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,339
go ahead and make an undesirable

672
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,440
environment what are easy ways to do

673
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:59,899
that an easy way to do that is to

674
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,690
already apply beneficial insects why not

675
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,910
start a colony of beneficial bugs in our

676
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,769
garden before the bad bugs even have a

677
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,840
chance to take hold you can start

678
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:10,789
getting your purse emili´s your swore

679
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,379
skis whatever you decide to use in there

680
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,789
do a little bit of research make sure

681
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,080
that you order the proper bugs that work

682
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,000
for your environment your temperature

683
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,129
and humidity will play a huge factor in

684
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,539
the bugs that you need to order but get

685
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,490
some predators in there get the army

686
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:25,039
established and get them started before

687
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,690
the bad guys can even get started so

688
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,420
another route you can take is by

689
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,100
spraying pesticide applications you can

690
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,529
use your essential oils your botanical

691
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:35,240
oils or you can use your light or heavy

692
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,700
chemical sprays whatever you choose to

693
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,579
use you can start applying them before

694
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,319
you see an insect infestation that way

695
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,909
if a bug does try to creep down the

696
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,349
ducting it jumps on the plant it goes

697
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,060
I'll [ __ ] that I don't want to be here

698
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,619
at all and it just tries to run it

699
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,450
doesn't invite its friends you can

700
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,969
create that undesirable environment

701
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,130
before you even get an infestation I

702
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,259
would start with a schedule and a

703
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,420
strategy beside that you're going to

704
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,890
spray every so often and then decide

705
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,200
that you need to rotate your products

706
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,180
this frequently and then set a schedule

707
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,620
and a routine and then if you see

708
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,490
anything you can step up your game

709
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,379
accordingly

710
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,319
we'll talk more about scheduling and

711
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,030
strategy a little later now let's say we

712
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,919
have been scouting and we have been

713
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,829
doing our preventative sprays and now we

714
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,019
have discovered some pests now how do we

715
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:23,029
treat them what's the first step the

716
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:26,059
first step is to correctly identify your

717
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:28,160
pest on a commercial scale it would save

718
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,519
a lot of time and energy to treat for

719
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,070
the correct pests the

720
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,039
time so the first step is to correctly

721
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:37,500
identify our pests the next step is to

722
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,019
think about how do we want to treat this

723
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,329
problem do we want to use predators do

724
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,129
we want to use horticultural oils do we

725
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:45,659
want to use botanical sprays do we want

726
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,340
to get in there with essential oils or

727
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,470
do we want to step up our game and start

728
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,149
using light pesticides or maybe even

729
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,100
stronger pesticides this is where we

730
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,050
have to think about that a lot of the

731
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,669
essential oils and the hippie products

732
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,259
aren't gonna get rid of a strong

733
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,590
infestation that's where you'll need to

734
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,900
step up to a mild pesticide a lot of the

735
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,059
pesticides are organic a lot of those

736
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,830
will work for you if you've got a

737
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,329
serious infestation and you don't want

738
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,069
to deal with some organic stuff you can

739
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:13,500
step your way up to more harsh chemicals

740
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:15,000
but like I said those are toxic and they

741
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,859
become dangerous and you need to think

742
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,990
about the ethics of what you are giving

743
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:20,969
to other people now if you're trying to

744
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,220
stay more organic if you're doing a TLO

745
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,829
sort of setup you can introduce predator

746
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,019
bugs perimeters are expensive you also

747
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:29,759
have to have specific insects to battle

748
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,379
specific insects you can't just release

749
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,509
one thing and expect it to go take care

750
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,730
of any bug that you may get Soper

751
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:37,289
dinners are an option they're also time

752
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,450
consuming you have to get out there and

753
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:41,250
let them go you have to apply and they

754
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,750
either come in sachets or they come in a

755
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,099
bottle with like a little spout you got

756
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,809
to let them out somehow they have to be

757
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:49,199
dispersed through the garden so they are

758
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,419
time consuming but they are organic they

759
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,950
are 100% organic you're not applying

760
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,720
anything to the garden that's going to

761
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,370
change the flavor you're not putting any

762
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,350
chemicals on there that may make anybody

763
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,719
else sick and they are completely safe

764
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,279
so you found a pest you identified the

765
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,660
pests you've done some research on

766
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,059
products that will help you get rid of

767
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,790
that pest to either beneficial bugs or

768
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:11,369
pesticide sprays and now you've decided

769
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:14,069
to apply that product now keep in mind

770
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:17,309
if we apply the same product to a pest

771
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:19,859
too many times those bugs will develop a

772
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,569
resistance so you'll see a bug you'll

773
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,219
treat it it'll look like it's gone it'll

774
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:25,409
come back you'll spray for that bug

775
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,120
again you'll think it's gone a couple

776
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,370
weeks later it'll come back you'll spray

777
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,989
twice as hard it'll come back and it

778
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:32,549
won't show up for a long time when it

779
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,960
does come back you won't be able to

780
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,549
spray it down with the product you've

781
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,160
been using before you'll have to switch

782
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:41,190
it up so to prevent that I recommend

783
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,900
using multiple modes of attack and don't

784
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,350
forget that if the pesticides work

785
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,759
together

786
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:46,649
and don't cause a chemical problem

787
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,359
together and don't disrupt the plant

788
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,309
health you can mix more than one

789
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,269
pesticide and it tank together I've done

790
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,519
an episode about it

791
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,710
titled tank mix don't be afraid to mix

792
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,058
multiple products together so you mix

793
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,579
your products you give it a good shake

794
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,950
you apply to your plants I would say

795
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,009
give it two or three days then apply a

796
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:07,860
different mix then if you still see the

797
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:10,048
presence of bugs apply a different mix

798
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,668
don't go at it with the same product

799
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:14,730
over and over because they will develop

800
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,500
a resistance to it earlier I said we

801
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,960
would talk about scheduling and strategy

802
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,839
so let's talk about a more scheduled and

803
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,090
detailed integrated pest management

804
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:26,339
strategy here is a quick rundown of my

805
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:28,889
scheduling and my strategy for pest

806
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:31,288
management in aggro now everything I

807
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,840
mentioned is approved by the Colorado

808
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:36,150
marijuana Enforcement Division and also

809
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,730
the Colorado Department of Ag I cannot

810
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:40,590
apply a pesticide that is on the banned

811
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,169
list or that has not been approved for

812
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:45,629
use in a commercial grow so everything

813
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,880
I'm using is approved by the state of

814
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,140
Colorado now to start my pest management

815
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,640
system every Monday I apply a specific

816
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,190
pesticide regimen to all of my

817
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,679
vegetative plants my small veg my large

818
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,659
veg my mother plants and the clones that

819
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,360
are rooted and in pots they all get

820
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,370
sprayed with a pesticide depending on

821
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,139
the size of the plant I may spray them

822
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:08,639
with a little more potent mix I may

823
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,590
spray them with a lighter Meg I'm a

824
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,690
spray with just one product I'm a mix up

825
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:14,908
multiple products at a time but every

826
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:18,120
Monday those plants are getting treated

827
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:20,820
I also write down exactly what I sprayed

828
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,250
on each plant that way next week I know

829
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,500
I can switch my pesticide I can spray

830
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,230
something different next week to prevent

831
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,210
a resistance now I know that my plants

832
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,069
have got a protective barrier there's a

833
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,740
little protection going on to prevent

834
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:37,230
from getting pests in the room if you're

835
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,230
using lighter sprays if you're using

836
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,269
botanical oils or essential oils you may

837
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,220
want to up your spray regimen to twice a

838
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:45,119
week if those things don't stick around

839
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,440
very long

840
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,048
you may want to apply them more

841
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,390
frequently so have a weekly spray

842
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:53,069
schedule in place and try to switch up

843
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,900
your products so that you can prevent

844
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:57,329
your pests from building any type of

845
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,150
resistance now when you're in there

846
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:02,129
applying the sprays spray the undersides

847
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,110
of the leaves you'll notice the spider

848
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,330
mites are on the underside of the leaves

849
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:08,129
why not spray there so start at the

850
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:10,259
bottom of the plant and start spraying

851
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,060
the underside of the leaf and work your

852
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,490
way up the plant to the top and you will

853
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,740
saturate the entire grow this way try to

854
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,089
cover all of the plants just to the

855
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,009
point of runoff right to when they start

856
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,990
dripping specific products will have

857
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,339
specific guidelines but I recommend you

858
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,529
spray rights where they start running

859
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:28,230
off you just want to saturate that plant

860
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:30,480
don't leave any desirable space for a

861
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,849
pest so get in there and spray once

862
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,789
maybe twice a week and you can do this

863
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:37,829
throughout the vegetative stage now once

864
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,389
we start approaching the flower phase we

865
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:41,460
need to think about what we are going to

866
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,040
do for pest management during the bloom

867
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,380
phase and a typical commercial grow I

868
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:50,099
would generally apply approved

869
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,320
pesticides until day 14 or 15 of the

870
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,599
flowering phase I may go in there the

871
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,399
first day of the third week and hit that

872
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,919
room one last time if I've had any

873
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,230
problems just to make sure those bugs

874
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,610
aren't coming back if you don't have any

875
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,019
buds building yet if you're just

876
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,909
starting to get bud set you should be

877
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,160
okay with one final spray if you were

878
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,529
selective with your products now if you

879
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,360
haven't seen any bugs you can taper off

880
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:14,250
your spray applications earlier in

881
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,079
flower and that's when we can start to

882
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,740
introduce our beneficial and predator

883
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,750
insects

884
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,910
now the beneficial insects work just

885
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:24,029
like pesticide applications you have to

886
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,890
reapply them at specified intervals most

887
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:28,079
of the vendors that provide live bugs

888
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,000
are willing to set you up on a schedule

889
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,639
to where you will receive the same order

890
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,500
every week that way you can rely on it

891
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,820
coming it'll show up at the grow you'll

892
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,079
say hey look they're here and then

893
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,250
you've got to hang them because they're

894
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,569
right there in your face you can't

895
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,190
forget you can't put it off they're

896
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:43,230
alive so that's a good way to get

897
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:46,110
yourself on a good regimen and a good

898
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,940
schedule of getting the live bugs out so

899
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:50,099
when a commercial grow we basically work

900
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,870
with spray applications until we see bud

901
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,849
set that's when we switch to the

902
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:55,529
predator bugs make sure to taper off

903
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:58,259
your spray application to where it

904
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:59,609
doesn't destroy your predator bugs now

905
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,230
if you've been releasing your predators

906
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,069
on your schedule and you start seeing

907
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,769
spider mites

908
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,179
you can order fast release predators

909
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,009
that will get in there and eat those

910
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,779
spider mites for you they come in a

911
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,410
bottle with a little spout and they are

912
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,009
hungry

913
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,720
you turn the

914
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,190
spout you open that bottle you point

915
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,779
that bottle at a leaf and the spyder

916
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,759
mine the party termites that are in

917
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:20,519
there start marching out they go and

918
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,619
destroy the spider mite colonies so if

919
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,269
you start seeing an infestation during

920
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,219
flower and you're already putting out

921
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,779
the bugs you just need to step up the

922
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,299
bugs and try to write it out through

923
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:32,339
flower you can D foliate take any spider

924
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,470
mite infested leaves out of there get

925
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:36,689
them out of the room don't go into a

926
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,549
different room after that don't drag the

927
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,559
bugs from the dirty room to the clean

928
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,149
room on your clothes trying to start the

929
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,919
day working in the clean room and then

930
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,240
work your way through to the dirtiest

931
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,460
rooms and try to work on the bug

932
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,140
infested room very last if that is an

933
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,910
option so if you've done everything

934
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,280
correctly you won't see spider mites

935
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,960
late in Flour but if you do and you're

936
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,660
using beneficial insects you've got the

937
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,940
option to apply more beneficial insects

938
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,259
I don't recommend spraying flowering

939
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,180
plants with anything

940
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,129
once you have bud set everything you

941
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,720
spray on there you will taste it if not

942
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,720
in the flower you will taste it in the

943
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,059
concentrates so if you do notice a

944
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,799
presence of bugs late in flower in your

945
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,169
flowering room and you were using

946
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,059
beneficial insects as your pest

947
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,550
management system or if you are using

948
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,379
sprays as your pest management system it

949
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:24,089
is time to step your game up in your

950
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,340
vegetative areas we need to eliminate

951
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,649
the pests in veg because if you've got

952
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,179
them in flower they are in veg and we

953
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,519
need to start getting rid of them and

954
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,380
having a clean grow before we move stuff

955
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,599
into the flower room because like I've

956
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,400
mentioned once we get past week three we

957
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,709
can't really spray those plants we can

958
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,930
only treat them with bugs and that takes

959
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,029
time to build up so let's focus on

960
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,700
getting the plants clean and pest free

961
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:49,710
before we even move them to that stage a

962
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,180
lot of people try to focus on the

963
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,799
flowering plants they want to get those

964
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,410
pest free those are on their way out

965
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,609
let's focus on the moms let's go all the

966
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,710
way to the beginning and get the mother

967
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:01,019
plants very clean let's get the source

968
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,910
material clean let's work on keeping the

969
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:05,009
clones clean let's learn how to get the

970
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,840
veg room immaculate so that way when we

971
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,430
move into the flower room we don't have

972
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,769
to battle bugs we don't have to battle

973
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:13,110
pests we can focus on building those fat

974
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,029
juicy buds and delicious trichomes that

975
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:17,009
we're all after now one thing I do

976
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:18,450
recommend is write down all of your

977
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:20,160
sprays if you were working in a

978
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,870
commercial grow you were required to

979
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,060
write down all of your sprays you have

980
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,808
to write down the date the time you also

981
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,450
have to write

982
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:29,398
on the name of every product and the EPA

983
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,379
number of every product and the amount

984
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,418
of every product that you applied you

985
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:35,248
have to write down the REI of each

986
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,200
product that you applied you have to

987
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:39,240
write down the lot number of plants

988
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,759
there's a lot of documenting to be done

989
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,769
in a commercial grow I recommend you do

990
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,360
the same thing in your private grow just

991
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:47,519
for peace of mind it's always nice to

992
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,168
have records and if you do end up

993
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,269
working in a commercial grow you've

994
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,759
already got experience writing down what

995
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:55,589
you've been using now I'm sure there are

996
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:59,249
a lot of people that will not agree with

997
00:33:55,589 --> 00:34:01,558
my pesticide spray application regimen

998
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:03,450
that is just fine with me I like the

999
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,220
people have different opinions that's

1000
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,019
just the method that I use in a

1001
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,059
commercial environment it's what has

1002
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,858
been proven to work for me it has been

1003
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:12,059
proven to be cost effective and it is

1004
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:15,078
something that I can train other

1005
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:17,549
employees to do on a repeatable basis

1006
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,679
just like all other aspects of growing

1007
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,720
cannabis the options for integrated pest

1008
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,369
management are endless and as long as

1009
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,230
it's making you happy as long as you

1010
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,010

1014
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,618

1015
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,318
didn't recommend any specific vendors I

1016
