be pollinated that i will not mention at

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,039
this time but the reversal is working

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,360
the project is underway things look good

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,798
the reverse plant is showing me that it

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
is reversing it is showing that it's

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,439
working there are male parts or pollen

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
parts popping up on this female plant it

100
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,280
looks successful i have dragged the

101
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,598
female plants into the room the pollen

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
receivers are in there i am debating if

103
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,598
they will get their final spray one more

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
spray uh they've gotten sprayed up to

105
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,359
day 21 i'm not sure if they're going to

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,719
get sprayed on day 24 or not it looks

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
like it's working

108
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,400
that's a that's a game time decision to

109
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,598
be made right there maybe hit one of

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,039
them don't hit the other two that's

111
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,518
something we'll think about document

112
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,079
mark down uh take good notes of but the

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,560
fem project is working that means that

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
there will be feminized seeds in a

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
little bit of time uh the plants do need

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
to get uh mature enough to accept the

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
pollen the pollen donors need to make

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
the pollen there needs to be a little

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,759
bit of uh action happening there then of

120

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,079
statements uh it says first and foremost

186

190
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,879
of this then it says i'm working my way

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,240
back through the catalog in reverse

192
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,240
order so i'm around 520 now the point is

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
i've heard you mention switching to 18

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,199
six at the end of flower for a week or

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,519
more yes uh in one episode i do mention

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
turning your timer back to 18-6 during

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,318
the flush phase when you begin flushing

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,280
your plants turn your light timer to 18

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,280
hours on and six hours off

200
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,879
i do get a lot of feedback a lot of

201
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,879
people think i'm crazy a lot of people

202
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,639
talk a lot of trash to me for this

203
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,038
method but all of the people that talk

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
[ __ ] about this method about this advice

205
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,038
refuse to try it so you can't talk [ __ ]

206
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
until you try something at least put one

207
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,399
or two plants in there and prove me

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
wrong before you talk [ __ ] to me that is

209
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,638
my theory i've done it and it works for

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
me so if you're just talking and you

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
haven't done it that that is not really

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
don't don't even bother messaging me

213
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,360
with that anyway our friend here says uh

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,519
i have grown out the same cut four times

215
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,598
and i've never had the buds swell at the

216
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,439
end like this if this mic wasn't on a

217
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,199
stand i would [ __ ] drop it it would

218
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,879
just be never had the bud swell like

219
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,879
this mic drop it would be over right

220
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
there you'd hear the thud and then some

221
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
dope ass music would play and i would

222
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
walk off we have a supporter here our

223
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,399

224
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
changing the timer to 18 hours on and

225

six hours off for the last 10 to 14 days

actual relationships with a lot of these

310
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
people the the older people that slow

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,278
down and take their time and talk to you

312
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,958
and they're not in a rush to get out and

313
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,078
get back on twitter and instagram or

314

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,440
people we really had time to connect and

318
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,199
they would tell me you know i smoked

319
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,839
this one and it didn't help much but i

320
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
smoked this one and i feel a lot better

321
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
and sometimes people would come with

322
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,919
their significant other older people

323
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,679

324
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,958
or their husband or their caretaker and

325
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,559
they would say you know since you gave

00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,719
exactly what you're talking about people

353
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,000
would come in and the first visit they

354
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
would be

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,679
intimidated scared confused they

356
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,278
wouldn't know what they were talking

357
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,638
about what they were buying they would

358
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,480
know they feel like [ __ ] and they're

359
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
down to try medical marijuana maybe that

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,159
will help by the fifth or sixth time

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
they came in to see me they would high

362
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,278

questions i just loved talking about it

411
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,039
they were kind of new at cannabis they

412
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959

413
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,319
answers and i just could not shut up

414
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,559
about it and it was perfect i really

415

thank you for the reminder of how much i

418
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,759
enjoy uh the connection of recommending

419
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
strains and then seeing a person i would

420
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,639
give you two or three strains and give

421
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,159
them to you on a discount price and send

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
you home and let you smoke them

423
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,360
sometimes back in the day bro we could

424
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,958
smoke those strains in the dispensary

425
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
and see what you liked but then you'd

426
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,319
come back and have reports and then we'd

427
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
improve the quality of your life that's

428
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,399
what it's all about so uh thank you for

429
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
reminding me that uh sometimes it did

430
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
bring tears to my eyes to see the

431
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,439
improvements that we could give to

432
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,919
people's quality of life and then also

433
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,560

442
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,198
go on i haven't figured that out yet

443
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,320
because it reverses and then what the

444
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,039
hell is going to happen but i'll put the

445
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,720

449
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,440

450
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,000
excuse me for the throat clearing also

451
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,320
i've been smoking a whole bunch of lemon

452
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,278
jeffrey live rosin out of a brand new

453
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
rig um the past couple of days have been

454
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,159
a little fuzzy i bought a new rig and

455
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,078
got a bunch of lemon jeffrey

456
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,000
concentrates on the same day

457
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,638
uh yeah i'm a spoiled brat but since

458
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,720
then i feel like i'm not sure if i'm

459
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,879
time traveling or if i'm frozen in time

460
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,639
or somewhere in between but time isn't

461
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,399
doing what it normally my clock isn't

462
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
spinning like this it's more kind of

463
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,639
like it's moving up and down in the spin

464
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
motion it is not consistent in any way

465
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,440
you guys don't care let me get to the

466
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,879

message it does go on it says i am

471
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,800
planning on working with a variety of

472
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,720
cultivars soon including scarlet

473
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,758
begonias what a great choice i hope that

474
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,680
works well for you it says my question

475
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,079
which insects would you make sure were

476
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,239
present before beginning an outdoor plot

477
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,399
or soon thereafter i understand more

478
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,519
research will be necessary that is one

479
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,679
of the keys i'm going to get to is

480
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,159
research will be necessary is i've never

481
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,078
worked with organic methods however is

482
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,240
there a handful or a list of insect

483
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,638
species that you or other commercial

484
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,480
growers prefer to ensure a healthier

485
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
garden perhaps i could foster a

486
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,159
healthier yard in general as some of

487
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,639
these species are already present in

488
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,120
this environment he says i've got wasps

489
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,560
and ladybugs and the list goes on

490
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
the thing is

491
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,479
you've seen the wasps and you have seen

492
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
the ladybugs you're already watching for

493
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
waspis which is what you should be doing

494
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,720
you know the ladybugs are there they're

495
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,439
basically harmless but you can't see

496
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
most of the harmful insects uh the bugs

497
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
that are really going to cause you

498
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
problems are microscopic the spider

499
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,198
mites the uh i don't even want to say

500
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,519
the russet mites uh the fungus gnats the

501
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,278
thrips uh the what are the things you're

502
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,278
gonna run into mites thrips aphids

503
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,278
aphids are very common outside in

504
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,519
colorado we get caterpillars the

505
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,198
caterpillars leave these little orange

506
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,720
melon they're melon caterpillars they

507
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
leave a melon worm in there they turn

508
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,639
orange they eat the inside of your buds

509
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
i'm not exactly sure what those are

510
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,680
but we get a lot of those kind of bugs

511
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,278
here those are bugs that i would prepare

512
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,599
to battle i'm not sure where you are you

513
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,600
didn't tell me where you are but then it

514
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
says also as well which host plants are

515
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,919
your go to thank you for the podcast and

516
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
cheers all right big disclaimer before i

517
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,959
even delve too deeply into this i am not

518
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,720
an outdoor organic grower i grow indoors

519
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
with bottled nutrients and most of my

520
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,199
pesticide prevention is honestly

521
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
straight up sprayed pesticide

522
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,600
applications until i move into flour

523
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,558
that's when we do play with the uh the

524
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,159
pest uh the predator bugs but uh i don't

525
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,759
do this outdoors and i don't know where

526
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,038
you are so one of the first things i'm

527
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,679
gonna recommend

528
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:38,240
is find an insectiary near you

529
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,038
there is a an insectiary near you that

530
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,599
distributes bugs to greenhouses and

531
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,960
farms for this purpose i'm not sure if

532
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,959
they're going to offer you the small

533
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
order that you need but you can get the

534
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,558
information that you need from them and

535
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,880
then find a retail provider from there i

536
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,678
can make other recommendations

537
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,840
but call an insectiary near you or call

538
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,080
other farmers near you or perhaps get on

539
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,240
the internet and do some research what

540
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,918
pests are coming to you be prepared i

541
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,759
already mentioned we're getting mites

542
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
thrips aphids caterpillars i don't know

543
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,519
where you are i don't know if there's a

544
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,599
specific bug that comes where you are

545
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,440
every region is going to have an extra

546
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,959
attacker that the farmers there know

547
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
about i know about the caterpillars here

548
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,079
because i hear people [ __ ] about it

549
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,200
every year here i know that that's a

550
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,960
thing

551
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,798
so do some research and be prepared for

552
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,120
what bugs are gonna come your way also

553
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,599
keep in mind uh we also get what are

554
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,439
they uh uh grasshoppers i couldn't think

555
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
of what [ __ ] grasshoppers were we get

556
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,558
a lot of grasshoppers here in pueblo

557
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,719
mid-summer there'll just be a gang of

558
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,960
grasshoppers appear out of nowhere uh we

559
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
also get deer in this area we also get

560
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,319
bear in this area it sounds crazy i live

561
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
in the city but a few miles that way

562
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,879
you'll see bear and they'll get into

563
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,720
your grow this [ __ ] smells good they

564
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,559
want to see what it is if you're feeding

565
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,000
it organics it smells real good and the

566
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,558
bears really want to know what it is if

567
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,558
you used a fish product and you you live

568
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,000
by the river and you're in colorado

569
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,558
expect a bear to come up to that [ __ ]

570
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,679
that's very likely very possible uh we

571
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,319
get deer bear rabbits grasshoppers uh

572
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,640
then all kinds of small uh rodents and

573
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,319
ground dwelling animals just low [ __ ]

574
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,799
low small stuff skunks and [ __ ] like

575
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,079
that will eat your weed plants ah cats

576
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,720
cats will eat the [ __ ] weed plants

577
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,720
i've seen plenty of cats in weed grows

578
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
so my first piece of advice is to see

579
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,440
what bugs what pest what problems may be

580
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
present who may show up uh you can

581
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,558
google that probably through the

582
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,079
internet there may be a grover's group

583
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,279
in your area i don't know if it's legal

584
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,798
or illegal and i don't know where you

585
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,038
are so half of my recommendations are

586
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,119
going to be vague but find what bugs are

587
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,839
coming find what problems are coming

588
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,159
anticipate that then also

589
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,879
do some research with that insectiary

590
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,000
other grows forms websites to find out

591
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,080
what bugs uh predator bugs will do well

592
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,759
in your neighborhood we could release

593
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,678
all of the predator bugs on the planet

594
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,480
we could spend a million bucks

595
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,798
but

596
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,240
doorbell i'll be right back

597
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,759
all right i apologize for that the

598
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,599
doorbell did ring i was expecting a

599
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,519
delivery it is here now i can focus more

600
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,918
on the show i got the package i needed

601
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,679
i'm excited uh may show you that in a

602
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
future episode let's get back where i

603
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
was what was i saying i said you can

604
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,798
order a million dollars worth of

605
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
predator insects to try to guard your

606
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,679
garden your outdoor plot but if they are

607
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
not the appropriate insects for your

608
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,759
environment they may

609
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,440
die they may fly away they may just

610
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,759
crawl away they may not even stick

611
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,038
around they may get eaten by other bugs

612
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,279
they may battle each other if you get

613
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,960
the wrong combination of things

614
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,599
so i would do a little bit of research

615
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,759
on what predator bugs will work well in

616
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,599
your area now i know that sounds crazy

617
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,960
but an insectiary would give you good

618
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,599
advice they would say hey these bugs

619
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,759
work well in your heat your humidity in

620
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,038
your environment because if you buy i'm

621
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,240
just going to give you an example maybe

622
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,480
you spend a thousand dollars on

623
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,000
hypoasmus miles and you put those out

624
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,599
there and i don't know the range that

625
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,119
the hypos like i know that they do like

626
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,879
my indoor grow that's what i buy for the

627
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,038
indoor cultivation if you put the

628
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,280
hypoaspis miles out there and it's too

629
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,798
hot or too cold they'll either die or

630
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,798
they'll leave they'll just simply

631
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,480
[ __ ] crawl away and go find a more

632
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,759
desirable environment they're just like

633
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,279
us if they don't like what's going on

634
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,798
they're going to go somewhere else so

635
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,038
you've got to get the bugs that are

636
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,639
appropriate for your environment a

637
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,720
website that will help you do that of

638
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,720
course is arbico organics it's

639
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
a-r-b-i-c-o-organics.com

640
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,440
i cannot give them any

641
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,038
positive or negative endorsements on

642
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,519
their products nor their customer

643
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,359
service i have seen uh plenty of

644
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,519
positive reviews and i've also seen

645
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,319
plenty of negative reviews i'm right in

646
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,240
the middle with the reviews i've read

647
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,240
i would do my own research when you

648
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,319
order bugs there's got to be a closer

649
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,400
insectiary to you to order the bugs from

650
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,319
the advantage of arbico is they'll sell

651
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,798
you very small batches a lot of other

652
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,200
places don't sell small batches of bugs

653
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,400
arbico will deliver a small batch to you

654
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,880
again

655
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,240
i can't support or say they're good or

656
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
bad i know that they do offer the

657
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
products we need i know their catalog is

658
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
awesome i know their website is awesome

659
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
but i've seen people say that they get

660
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
dead bugs from them i've also seen

661
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
people say that they get amazing bugs

662
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,038
from them so be careful with that that

663
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,200
is going to be your decision to make

664
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,599
there although their website and their

665
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,519
magazines and catalogs are awesome for

666
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,439
research for information for educational

667
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,119
purposes even if you don't purchase from

668
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,880
them you can use their website to get

669
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,639
you a lot of information get you a lot

670
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,400
of education get yourself a nice

671
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,559
foundation and background you can read a

672
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
lot from their website again it's arbico

673
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,519
a-r-b-i-c-o-organics.com i believe to

674
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,079
the best of my recollection did not

675
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,079
write that down but um

676
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,639
one thing that i read is they don't they

677
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,798
don't breed any bugs they buy their bugs

678
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
from an insectiary and then mail them to

679
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,200
you they're kind of like a third party

680
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
uh they're like the amazon of bugs so i

681
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
may be easier if you can find a local

682
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
insectiary near you to get the

683
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
appropriate bugs that's the way to do it

684
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,319
and use arbico for your research again

685
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
if you can't find a supplier that

686
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,000
website is always there for you do your

687
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,519
own research i'm trying to be really

688
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,038
diplomatic about this i've read good and

689
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,440
bad reviews you guys i don't know which

690
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,679
way i sway uh if it's my only option i

691
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,919
may risk it uh risk a few bucks to save

692
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,720
the garden where was i do some research

693
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,480
then

694
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
once you've established which bugs will

695
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
live in your area and which bugs are

696
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,919
going to battle your area order the

697
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,359
appropriate bugs

698
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,600
i like to set up the subscription

699
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,678
service you can order them order them to

700
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,359
you can schedule them to come on

701
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,519
specific intervals when i run a

702
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,599
commercial grow i usually have them show

703
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,879
up either every week or every two weeks

704
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,639
depending on

705
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
the threat that is present if i see bugs

706
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,480
we double up if i don't see bugs we go

707
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,119
once a week with the sachets and with

708
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,200
the releasing of pests so let me give

709
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,119
you a quick list of the predators that i

710
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,319
did write down i don't think i wrote

711
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,639
down all of them because i just thought

712
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,278
of cucumarus and it's not on the list ah

713
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
the cucumaris the californicus some of

714
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,640
these they changed their names i may

715
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,558
repeat things because they've got double

716
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,559
names there's the californicus the

717
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:53,038
cucumaris the swarsky hypoaspis miles

718
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,200
lace wings that's a good start i think

719
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,038
those will work in a lot of environments

720
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
and they are very aggressive predators a

721
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,759
lot of people like ladybugs

722
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,519
ladybugs are lazy in my opinion

723
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,960
that is my honest opinion you can buy a

724
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,359
lot of ladybugs and they're not going to

725
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,480
do a lot the ladybug larvae will eat a

726
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,240
lot but

727
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,759
the green lacewing in my opinion will

728
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,120
eat three times i don't know the science

729
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,679
behind this i don't know but from what

730
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
i've seen when i use ladybugs they end

731
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,600
up in the lights and the ducting on the

732
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,038
floor uh just over there humping each

733
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,639
other you see them [ __ ] all the time

734
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,480
they make really cool pictures but they

735
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,720
don't eat the [ __ ] bugs when i

736
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,558
release green lacewing eggs i don't see

737
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,319
any more bugs i don't see any any lace

738
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,839
wings anywhere they're not over there

739
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,519
chilling out i'm not taking pictures of

740
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,678
them they're being [ __ ] warriors and

741
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,519
they're eating all of the bugs i want

742
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,519
them to eat and they're really really

743
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,038
fun to watch they're so ugly they turn

744
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,879
start off as little crocodiles and they

745
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,278
start getting little wings and they just

746
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
go through this weird metamorphosis

747
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,240
those are the lace wings so i am not a

748
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,720
bug expert i'm not an outdoor growing

749
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
expert but i do recommend that you

750
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,480
research the bugs that will be coming to

751
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,759
your area uh it's going to be spider

752
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,558
mites thrips aphids caterpillars fungus

753
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,679
um whatever bugs come in your area i

754
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,038
don't know where you are see it's hard

755
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,360
for me to anticipate so you got to find

756
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,759
what's coming to your area then think

757
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,839
about cucumarus californis is it

758
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,359
californicus uh you'll figure it out

759
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,119
when you search predator

760
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,719
arbico organics will have it all right

761
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,000
there for you i don't even need to

762
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,120
repeat this once you get to arbico

763
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,278
you're going to see more than what i'm

764
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,719
saying uh rove beetles are [ __ ] great

765
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,558
there's a lot of great things

766
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,159
what are the assassin beetles there are

767
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,599
a lot that you can release but if

768
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,120
they're not right for your area they're

769
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,798
not gonna have a good time they're gonna

770
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,719
leave like if you took me to a fish

771
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,720

780
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320

expert she's a pesticide expert i am

798
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,319
trained by the colorado department of

799
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,120
agriculture uh the colorado state

800
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,158
university also trained by the colorado

801
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,798
department of public health and

802
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,480
environment and pesticide application

803
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,480
pesticide handling i am trained the

804
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,079
trainer certified so i do know quite a

805
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
bit about pesticides and pesticide

806
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,558
application however what you're asking

807
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,640
is very regionally specific so i would

808
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,558
focus in on your region on the pests

809
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
attacking your area the pests uh the

810
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,839
prevention that would work in your area

811
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,839
