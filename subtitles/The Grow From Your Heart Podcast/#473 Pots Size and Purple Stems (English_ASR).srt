17
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,658
made me want to just sit down I want her

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,210
to chill out after dabbing the banana

19
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,650
orange cookies full spectrum extract I'm

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,280
flipping it over to read the back of the

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,560
label it says that this product contains

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,829
77% THC I'm gonna crack it open to give

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,259
you a fresh smell the first aroma is

24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,519
straight-up Orange Julius if you've ever

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,459
had like an orange smoothie

26
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,429
that's the original aroma that hits you

27
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:31,559
followed by a hint of cookie dough with

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,090
maybe a touch of black pepper and I know

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,579
that's a really interesting aroma a

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,469
combo of flavors there but my nose picks

31
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,389
up a lot of stuff when you dab it it

32
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,368
tastes just like you're smoking the

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,019
banana cush and orange cookies if you

34
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,659
know what those strains taste like it's

35
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,269
got that smooth cushy flavor maybe a

36
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,240
hint of the banana runts and then it has

37
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,679
got also a really orange smoothie sort

38
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,569
of a flavor so big shout out to our

70
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,339
question a cultivation question a

71
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,930
cannabis culture question I would love

72
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,090
to hear from you you can send me an

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,770

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,289
heart at hotmail.com

75
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,409
the first email in today's episode goes

76
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,969
just like this it says hey my name is

77
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,009
and then at the end basically I would

78
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,989
like to remain anonymous so my name is

79
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,909
anonymous I'm a first time grower I'm

80
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,039
growing for my dad since he has quit

81
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,389
using fentanyl patches after ten years

82
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,560
and now uses cannabis for his pain

83
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,359
purchasing from dispensaries has become

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,520
expensive so we have decided to start

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,870
growing there's a lot of good stuff to

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,969
talk about here we've got a first-time

87
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,739
grower so welcome to the club welcome to

88
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,090
the family thank you for listening to

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,739
the show I hope I'm able to guide you

90
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,479
through this and give you a good first

91
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,739
grow experience I hope I make it easier

92
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,569
for you

93
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,129
Congrats to your dad for quitting the

94
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,139
fentanyl patches for ten years

95
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,359
that [ __ ] is not good for you I hope

96
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,069
that cannabis is able to ease the pain

97
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,020
and I hope that it makes his life more

98
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,819
enjoyable and I hope it makes your time

99
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,290
together more enjoyable then you were

100
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,750
totally correct purchasing from a

101
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,219
dispensary can get quite expensive so

102
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,709
that is where many folks like yourself

103
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,449
decide to start growing their own the

104
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,639
email goes on to say I have a question

105
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:20,159
about planting right into the final pot

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,349
for example planting into a five gallon

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,939
pot I know that you have to carefully

108
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,770
water it until its roots grow into the

109
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,480
space but I would just like to hear the

110
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,919
pros and cons

111
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,439
first time Grover makes everything

112
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,199
really intimidating even though I've had

113
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,699
some help from an experienced friend so

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,079
we've got a great question about pot

115
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,370
size I'm going to get into that in just

116
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,529
a moment I want to keep reading the

117
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,060
message it says I built a grow cabinet

118
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,679
for stealth growing since it's illegal

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,540
to grow within 20 miles of any

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
dispensary you know I really don't like

121
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,900
that rule since there's a shop 25 miles

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,730
away they don't think you should be able

123
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,589
to grow your own but people that are 26

124
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,330
miles away can produce a product that

125
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,099
they can use that's not fair in my

126
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,870
opinion nothing I can do about that

127
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,790
except express my opinion that it's

128
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,949
[ __ ] I'm gonna keep moving the

129
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,780
dimensions of our grow box is four feet

130
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,310
by two feet and five and a half feet

131
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,799
tall so we've got very minimal space

132
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,220
still adequate space to provide our own

133
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,670
medicine the light source is an LED HL

134
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,520
GV 2 3000 k quantum board with an AC

135
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,520
infinity t4 fan and planting into

136
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,709
organic soil with a 70/30 mix of perlite

137
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,120
that sounds good so far the pH I don't

138
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,310
worry about too much of the pH in the

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,769
soil you're eighty degrees that's gonna

140
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,439
be a little bit warm with about 50 to 55

141
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,269
percent relative humidity I just planted

142
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,189
my first seed yesterday into a five

143
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:38,399
gallon smart pot I want to keep

144
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,509
everything organic so far it sounds like

145
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,639
you've got a good idea and you're off to

146
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,560
a good start it wraps up with I love

147
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,839
your podcast I'm just getting into them

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,720
and I'm learning so much from listening

149
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,149
thank you for reading from your friend

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,410
anonymous there's a lot of great stuff

151
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,669
in here thank you for listening to the

152
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,040
show I appreciate that they said they

153
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,750
are listening and learning so much so

154
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,430
that means a lot to me I put a lot of

155
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,439
effort into this show so to know that at

156
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,540
least one person is learning that means

157
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,000
a lot let's talk a little bit about the

158
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,250
main question here planting into the

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,079
final pot so this person has planted

160
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,850
their first seedling directly into a

161
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,949
five gallon smart pot they've got a

162
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,200
70/30 mix of perlite they're planted

163
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,000
into organic soil it sounds like they've

164
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,949
got a decent girl environment their main

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,959
question is ah they would like to hear

166
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,389
the pros and cons of directly planting

167
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,669
into that five gallon pot now there are

168
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,979
pros and cons to this absolutely I would

169
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,710
prefer to go into a smaller container

170
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,480
first then as my plant gets larger of

171
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,219
course I would transplant into a larger

172
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,930
container until I was in the final pot

173
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,570
which that plant would finish in there

174
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,709
are several advantages to starting in a

175
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,870
smaller container

176
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,899
we'll start my seedlings or my clones in

177
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,899
a very small pot it is not uncommon for

178
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,569
me to start seedlings or clones in a

179
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,339
beer cup or a 6-inch net pot if I use a

180
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,569
beer cup I put plenty of holes in the

181
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,939
bottom of the cup to get plenty of

182
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,790
drainage or I will use a four inch or a

183
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,920
six inch net pot for small plants now

184
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:05,370
let's talk about why I do this I don't

185
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,620
need to use as much water to water a cup

186
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,689
or a four inch or a six inch net pot as

187
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,879
I would if I were trying to saturate a

188
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,829
three a five or a seven gallon pot

189
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,500
filled with this soil or soilless mix

190
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,449
now in a small personal garden these

191
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,069
small details may not matter a whole lot

192
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,229
but when I get to a commercial scale

193
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,939
when I've got a whole bunch of plants

194
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,580
this is going to make a huge difference

195
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,519
I only need one cup of water to water

196
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,409
two cups with plants in them if I've got

197
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,839
them in seven gallon pots it's going to

198
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,970
take me to maybe four gallons of water

199
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,369
to fully saturate those seven gallon

200
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,080
pots now if you scale that up and scale

201
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,149
that up on a commercial environment each

202
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,949
gallon becomes more expensive I'm

203
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,599
putting nutrients in it I've got to have

204
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,909
a person mix it I've got to have a

205
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,520
person pH it everything starts to get

206
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,410
more costly as we scale things up so I

207
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,180
don't need as much water I don't need as

208
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,939
much nutrient if I'm using a smaller

209
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,129
container I also give myself less of a

210
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,469
chance of drowning or over watering my

211
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,449
plant if I'm using a smaller container I

212
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,100
know that sounds backwards and that

213
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,289
large container you need to fully

214
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,450
saturate all of that soil or soilless

215
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,160
mix or cocoa the first time you put that

216
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,899
plant in there you've got a lot of

217
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,120
volume to saturate which is going to

218
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,949
take a large volume of water your plant

219
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,870
is going to get really wet that

220
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,060
container is going to take a really long

221
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,189
time to dry out your plant will have a

222
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,990
very good opportunity to get root rot

223
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:26,459
there's going to be too much water for

224
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,009
too long in that container

225
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,500
if you overwater that smaller container

226
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,419
it will dry up much more quickly so

227
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,429
you've got an opportunity to rescue that

228
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,289
plant and you're not going to be pouring

229
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,089
in as much water anyway because the

230
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,579
container is not as large and you're not

231
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,889
attempting to saturate as much soil

232
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,020
soilless mix cocoa whatever you've

233
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,669
chosen to put in your container so the

234
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,949
first advantage is you don't need as

235
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:52,019
much water and you run less of a risk of

236
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,060
drowning that plant on the first couple

237
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,490
of waterings the second advantage is

238
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:56,889
though

239
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,810
smaller pots don't require as much space

240
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,549
now that doesn't really make a big deal

241
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,649
and a small person will grow but as we

242
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,259
expand to a commercial environment every

243
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,629
inch costs a lot of money real estate is

244
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,610
expensive every square foot of my grow

245
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:11,860
needs to be filled with productive

246
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,080
plants and I also need to be able to fit

247
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,509
as many plants as I can in some of these

248
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,490
type veg spaces so it would be a bit of

249
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,799
a waste of space for me to put small

250
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,919
plants into three five or seven gallon

251
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,679
pots if you think about it a five gallon

252
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,110
pot is probably approximately fourteen

253
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,729
to sixteen inches around and even when

254
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,709
you press a bunch of five gallon pots

255
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,690
together you still waste a bunch of

256
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,699
space because even when the pots are

257
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,500
edge-to-edge you get that little diamond

258
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,320
worth of space between each pot but you

259
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,190
cannot fill so five gallon pots eat up a

260
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,500
lot of space

261
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,089
I could reduce all of that space by

262
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,820
putting the plants in two four or six

263
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:52,930
inch net pots and I can fit probably I'm

264
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,149
just guessing about 20 25 maybe 34 inch

265
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:57,219
net pots under a t5 light comfortably

266
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,350
and I'm visualizing in my head that I

267
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,660
can maybe fit six or eight maybe nine or

268
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,240
twelve five or seven gallon pots under

269
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,819
the same t5 light so that takes up a lot

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,740
of unnecessary space and in a commercial

271
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,930
environment when you start expanding the

272
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,509
numbers that space really gets eaten up

273
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:15,909
quite quickly so I really like to

274
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,439
utilize my space by using a smaller pot

275
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:19,179
and then when the plant grows into that

276
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,730
pot that's when I applied it to the next

277
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:24,759
pot so that brings me to the next reason

278
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,440
I prefer to start in smaller pots if the

279
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,759
plants are healthy if they're being fed

280
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,560
well if they're getting a good root

281
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,208
inoculation some sort of beneficial

282
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,528
fungus and some microbes and you've got

283
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,449
good lighting on them and they aren't

284
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:36,730
experiencing any problems and they're

285
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,709
being watered properly we should start

286
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,570
seeing some dynamic explosive root

287
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,969
growth and those pots should get filled

288
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,440
quite quickly as soon as those pots are

289
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,149
kind of filled and the plants are

290
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,700
getting a little bit root bound that's

291
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,379
when I like to transplant I like to flip

292
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,300
the pot upside down and get the plant

293
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,220
out where the plant is hanging between

294
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:56,078
my middle finger and my ring finger

295
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,509
where the plant is completely upside

296
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,969
down then I basically lift the pot off

297
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:03,039
of the plant like it's the lid then I've

298
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,259
got the roots in my hand I've usually

299
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,139
got so much root development that the

300
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:09,909
Coco stays completely pressed together

301
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,460
at this time nothing falls out that's

302
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:14,889
how tight I let them grow I will take my

303
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,870
fingers of my other hand and just dig it

304
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,970
directly into the middle of the bottom

305
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,289
of that pot I'm just going now it's the

306
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,970
top because the plants upside down I'm

307
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,409
going straight in from the top directly

308
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,480
in the middle and just wiggle my fingers

309
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:27,519
a little bit and my idea is to just

310
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,529
break those roots up and break that dirt

311
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,990
up a little bit tor when I put it into

312
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,699
the next pot those roots just take off

313
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,149
they say oh I was in there a little bit

314
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,940
tight but now watch me explode and watch

315
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,740
me stretch if you transplant properly

316
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,900
into the next pot if you don't bury them

317
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,700
too deep if you sprinkle like a little

318
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,199
root inoculant maybe some recharge or

319
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,150
something like that on there and you

320
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,920
bury them properly and then you water

321
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,179
them properly and put them back under

322
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,459
the right whites and give them enough

323
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,370
airflow and enough love those roots will

324
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,070
take off and those plants will show you

325
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,810
vigorous robust growth so I really think

326
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,910
that trapping the roots just a little

327
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,279
bit and letting it get just a little bit

328
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:08,649
compacted in that pot you need put it in

329
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,240
the next pot it really makes it take off

330
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,669
it is like hell yeah there is some

331
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,379
freedom also it's got big tires now so

332
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,729
it can go romping through the mud you're

333
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,649
not going to have a problem with

334
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,259
drowning it when you transplant into the

335
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,090
next container so the first advantage to

336
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:24,309
starting with either a beer cup or a

337
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,009
four inch or a six inch net pot or

338
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:28,569
sometimes I even use those four inch

339
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,100
nursery pots or a little 6 inch nursery

340
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,629
pot just something smaller to

341
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,370
consolidate and condense the garden a

342
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:35,409
little bit the main advantage to using

343
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,539
something small like that is it doesn't

344
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:39,399
take as much of course it doesn't take

345
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:41,319
as much soil or soilless mix you don't

346
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,730
have to start off with so much soil that

347
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,350
you're not going to use right away then

348
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,720
you don't need as much water and

349
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,909
nutrients to water that smaller amount

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,620
of soilless mix or soil or cocoa

351
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:52,240
whatever you've chosen so you don't need

352
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,909
as much water you don't need as much

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,039
nutrient also you don't run as much risk

354
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:58,870
of drowning the plants on the initial

355
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,819
first few waterings if you've got a new

356
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,529
seedling or you've got a new clone you

357
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,270
do run the risk of drowning that bad

358
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,919
[ __ ] at the very beginning they're very

359
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,259
sensitive when they just start

360
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,689
developing roots so the main advantage

361
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:13,419
is less water the second advantage is

362
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,790
less space you don't have to waste a

363
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,799
seven a three or a five gallon pot worth

364
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,539
of space for a plant you can fit in a

365
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,679
six inch net pot that is a lot more

366
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,448
plants under less lighting you will be

367
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,638
more efficient when it comes to

368
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:28,099
commercial environments or reducing

369
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,930
costs and a small home grow finding ways

370
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,550
to become more efficient can really cut

371
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:32,778
a lot of costs if you really pay

372
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:35,149
attention and think about what you're

373
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,519
doing this is a great way to do it so we

374
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,899
can turn off all those extra T fives and

375
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,659
just move all the plants right under

376
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,808
this one we can save some money so less

377
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:47,448
water less space then when we do up high

378
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:49,159
I see explosive growth I think that the

379
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,769
plants really take off when you go from

380
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,509
that six-inch pot I go in from a six to

381
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,610
a three and if I upgrade from the three

382
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,220
then I go to a seven and that's usually

383
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,688
as big as I go because I stay indoors so

384
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,028
let's talk a little bit about that

385
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,428
progression most of the time I start in

386
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:06,139
a clone machine or in a clone dome I

387
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:08,600
will go from the clone machine or the

388
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,028
clone dome usually into a four inch or a

389
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,619
six inch net pot sometimes I go into a

390
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,688
beer cup just depending on where I'm

391
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,790
working the plants will grow in that

392
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,618
beer cup or that nap pot until I see

393
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,169
that they are getting kind of tight in

394
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:23,149
that container I will actually pull the

395
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,490
plant out of the cup out of the pot and

396
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:27,889
visually inspect the roots I want to see

397
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,509
thick white spaghetti look in roots I

398
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,278
want them to be fat and filling that

399
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,499
container I want them swirled around the

400
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,149
outside of the container once I see that

401
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,860
container is filled with roots that is

402
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,958
when it is time to up pot to my next

403
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,459
container depending on the genetics

404
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,039
depending on your environment sometimes

405
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:45,258
they stay in these cups for two or four

406
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,849
weeks then they will move into their

407
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,919
next container and they will stay there

408
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,089
for probably two to four weeks before

409
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,248
they go into flower

410
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,379
but I'll move from a cup into a three

411
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:56,300
gallon pot most of the time those three

412
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,278
gallon pots are what I like to flower in

413
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:00,919
a commercial environment in some

414
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,360
situations perhaps in a personal home

415
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,009
grow where I may be breeding and my

416
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,379
numbers are limited and I want larger

417
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,209
plants I may use a seven gallon pot at

418
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:10,428
that time I'll go from the cup to the

419
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,989
three gallon pot to the seven gallon pot

420
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:14,058
and then I will veg for only about a

421
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,678
week in that seven gallon pot because

422
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,688
the plants are gonna take off I'm about

423
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,278
to flip them into flower and I just want

424
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:21,019
them to be able to develop some roots

425
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,490
into that new soil and take off the

426
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,990
roots will keep growing for the first

427
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,089
couple of weeks of flower and I feel

428
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,610
like I fill that container quite well by

429
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,529
the end of the flowering phase also that

430
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,568
big seven gallon pot gives me plenty of

431
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:34,308
time between waterings so I'm able to go

432
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,769
out of town and go to the Indo Expo for

433
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,749
the weekend

434
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,879
I'm able to go see fish for a couple of

435
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:41,249
days by using that seven gallon pot I

436
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,170
can water that Friday morning and it

437
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:45,149
will usually last me until Monday

438
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,399
morning's watering without any worries

439
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,808
so in most scenarios I go from the

440
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,610
cloner to the cup

441
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:52,409
then into a three gallon in most

442
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,928
situations I flower at that point

443
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:57,178
sometimes I'll throw it into a seven veg

444
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:59,308
for another week or 10 days flower I'm

445
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:00,928
out at that point then I feel like I

446
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:02,669
really fill that container with a

447
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:04,738
perfect root mass by the time harvest

448
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,808
comes so I told you the reasons why I

449
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:09,179
plant into a smaller container and work

450
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:11,338
my way up you asked for pros and cons on

451
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:13,738
the pros of starting in a smaller

452
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,529
container I already mentioned less space

453
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:18,209
less water you're more efficient in

454
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:21,600
general and then you get that explosive

455
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:23,159
growth the cons are you have to plan you

456
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,048
have to be on a cycle you have to know

457
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,118
when to transplant it's going to take

458
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:29,308
you more transplant times you have more

459
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,899
opportunity to cause damage to the plant

460
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:33,269
so let me talk more about some of the

461
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,428
things I just said cycles if you are

462
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,048
running a perpetual cycle you are going

463
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:39,448
to have to transplant plants on a

464
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:41,818
regular cycle or you will fall out of

465
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:44,188
your routine I work in a commercial

466
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:46,139
environment I've got a crew of guys that

467
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:48,688
I say hey we've got to get all of these

468
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,369
cups into these pots but before we get

469
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:52,558
all of these cups into these pots we've

470
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:54,990
got to move all of these pots to that

471
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,938
room so it all flows in one big move

472
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,850
I've got two or three guys moving plants

473
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:01,980
from the veg area to the flower area and

474
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,078
as they're emptying space I've got guys

475
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,179
getting cups out of the veg the small

476
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,788
veg area and moving them into the large

477
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,278
veg area but if that rhythm gets broken

478
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:13,619
it will throw everything off for a long

479
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:15,480
time if you've got one plant that takes

480
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,250
too long to finish or if you've got a

481
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,959
week where you don't feel good or if you

482
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,209
want to go out of town and you can't

483
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,788
transplant on your cycles your plants

484
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,649
will show it in the end also each of

485
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:28,408
those transplants will give you another

486
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,449
opportunity to cause stress to your

487
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,039
plant if you're not an experienced

488
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,659
gardener and you're not good at potting

489
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,849
the plants you will cause a little bit

490
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:37,528
of stress to them I am very confident in

491
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,418
myself and the guys and the facilities

492
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:41,250
in which I operate so I know that they

493
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,870
can get the plants out of a small pot

494
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,700
and get it right into that big pot and

495
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,229
those plants will never show you a sign

496
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,819
that they slowed down most of the time

497
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,390
the next day they're like hey we're

498
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:50,460
going

499
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,230
thank you for the new shoes but if

500
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,120
you're a new grower you're not super

501
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,798
experienced you may have some questions

502
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,599
you may try some new [ __ ] you may make

503
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,639
some little mistakes who knows what's

504
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,558
gonna happen in your grow you do get the

505
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,080
opportunity to cause stresses during

506
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,519
each transplant one of the advantages

507
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,529
though you don't have to transplant a

508
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,329
bunch of times like I'm transplanting

509
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,710
one or two times and that's stressful

510
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,539
and I've got a lot of plants so it takes

511
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,460
a long time we've got a crew of guys

512
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,349
doing it I could cause a lot of problems

513
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,940
to plants if we [ __ ] up the other

514
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:19,678
advantage is that you already know how

515
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,570
much space your plants are gonna take

516
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,009
there in that pot that's how much room

517
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:25,109
you get then you can watch them grow

518
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,940
into that then you can flower like you

519
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,529
said in the beginning you do have to be

520
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,450
careful with watering just make sure

521
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,190
that you don't drown this plant when

522
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,600
we're using smaller containers the soil

523
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,880
or soilless mix has more of an

524
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,709
opportunity to dry so if we do overwater

525
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,240
it'll just dry up and the plants will

526
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,620
kind of rescue themselves the roots

527
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,200
won't get smothered for too long and

528
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,579
will survive in a bigger pot it's going

529
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,380
to take longer for that stuff at the

530
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,349
bottom to dry so you're gonna have a

531
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,940
really wet bottom and a dry top and most

532
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,399
of your root growth is going to still be

533
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,600
up at the top the roots are going to dig

534
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,519
for the bottom and look for water

535
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,750
they'll probably find it down there at

536
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,400
the bottom and try to drink from that

537
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,798
you're really gonna have to find the

538
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,000
balance to get the top the right level

539
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,470
of moisture in the bottom the right

540
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,298
level of moisture and get that root

541
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,950
growth growing properly it may be

542
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:10,139
frustrating it could be a struggle

543
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,509
you're in a five gallon pot it could be

544
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,820
bigger it could be worse just be very

545
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,650
careful not to overwater and not to

546
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,119
drown this plant I think that pretty

547
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,710
much covers it let's read more quickly

548
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,629
about the grow here he's got a small

549
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,970
space it's four by two by five and a

550
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,620
half make sure you don't veg too long

551
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,350
these plants are gonna get tall quickly

552
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,489
and you've got a short space that box is

553
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,899
five and a half feet tall you're

554
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,940
probably taking up a little bit of space

555
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,679
with the light I would suggest using a

556
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,179
trellis or some sort of a net so you can

557
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,980
spread the plants out and keep them low

558
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,630
that way you can fill that space to its

559
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,789
maximum potential and get a nice harvest

560
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,080
out of there he's got a good light in

561
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,808
this space it sounds like he's got a

562
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,789
good fan I wonder about the airflow and

563
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,960
the air exchange are we getting air in

564
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,200
and out of there so we don't get

565
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,340
stagnant air we've got a soil pH test

566
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,890
which is okay I don't worry too much

567
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,678
about that it is a little bit warm in

568
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,300
that grow environment also it may be a

569
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,690
little bit too humid when you put the

570
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,069
plan

571
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,259
in there and start watering you're going

572
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:05,908
to get more humidity especially with

573
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,919
that much heat so you're going to need

574
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,659
to exchange that air that is something

575
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,009
that is going to come up probably a

576
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:13,379
little bit later in the grow as the

577
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,729
plants get larger they'll start working

578
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,408
more they'll need more water they'll

579
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:18,330
start letting out more water you're

580
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,519
going to run into humidity issues I

581
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:22,378
would start working on that before it

582
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,479
becomes a problem don't put yourself in

583
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:26,368
scramble mode you've got some expensive

584
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:29,848
seeds probably you've got some expensive

585
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:31,888
gear you are doing this illegally so you

586
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:34,048
are putting yourself at risk be very

587
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:35,098
careful let's get this correct if you're

588
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:36,720
gonna do it do it right

589
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:38,548
get something to reduce that humidity

590
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,169
and that temperature now before we get

591
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:42,179
to that stage all right I want to thank

592
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:43,710
you for the great email good luck down

593
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,659
there in prohibition land be very

594
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,639
careful don't tell anybody else about

595
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,559
your grow but thank you for the great

596
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:51,719
email all right let's keep going well

597
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:54,028
I've got this good flow going this next

598
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,009
message came from let's see it says hey

599
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:57,690
Ross to Jeff you can call me Ridge what

600
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:59,999
up Ridge nice to meet you I am Rasta

601
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,970
Jeff the message says I'm a big fan of

602
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:05,700
your podcast your content and your

603
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,348
ability to describe a visual image of

604
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,369
whatever you are talking about right

605
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:10,319
into my head

606
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:13,108
hey that is cool man thank you because I

607
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,608
do a lot of work trying to describe what

608
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:16,769
I'm talking about in multiple different

609
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:18,509
ways so that everybody can see what I'm

610
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,848
trying to say people learn in different

611
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,499
ways some people are book learners some

612
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:24,210
people are listening learners some

613
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:25,499
people are reader learners some people

614
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,329
actually have to get their hands dirty

615
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,829
to figure out what they're doing so I

616
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,148
really do make an effort to teach in

617
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,858
multiple ways that I can include

618
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,209
everybody and make sure that everybody

619
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:35,970
learns a little something so thank you

620
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,950
for noticing that I'm trying to describe

621
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,929
a visual image and I'm trying to get it

622
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,119
right into your head Ridge goes on to

623
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,009
say I usually listen on YouTube you help

624
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:45,418
me out with the tab timer issue a while

625
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,848
back hey I remember you

626
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,109
that's good to hear from you again the

627
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,158
message goes on to say for your new

628
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,228
buddy from France

629
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,309
we had a message from a person in France

630
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,528
who had a grow tent and they were

631
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:57,329
concerned about light leaking in and I

632
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:59,519
recommended some advice to our friend

633
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,989
Ridge I recommended some blackout

634
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,819
curtains and he said those blackout

635
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:04,710
curtains work well for me I just hang

636
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,658
them around the tent almost like a

637
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,239
dressing room around my tent and the air

638
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,429
comes in under the curtains he goes on

639
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:12,869
to say I stuck velcro on the curtain to

640
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,610
stick them back out of the way when I

641
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:15,859
work

642
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:17,659
I hope this helps cheers to you and all

643
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:21,079
growers and a big [ __ ] you to

644
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,700
Prohibition from your friend Ridge so

645
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,960
this is a great idea if you were growing

646
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,090
in a grow tent and you're worried that

647
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,529
you may be exposing your plants to light

648
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,209
because a lot of those grow tents are

649
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,730
made quite cheaply they do have very

650
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,769
small light leaks in them here's a quick

651
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,509
tip if you're growing in a grow tent go

652
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,829
inside that bad dog and turn off the

653
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:38,269
light and sit in there for a minute and

654
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:39,980
see if you were getting any light from

655
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,569
the outside environment if you're

656
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,190
getting light in your grow tent you need

657
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,529
to correct that you need to make some

658
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,150
adjustments some of those light leaks

659
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,399
are correctable just by putting a piece

660
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,350
of black tape over them unfortunately

661
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,600
many of those tents were made with the

662
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:55,639
shitty mesh that will allow light to

663
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,319
penetrate the walls of the tent and get

664
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,330
to your plants which will interrupt your

665
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,039
night cycle this is where people are

666
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:02,929
trying to find creative solutions to

667
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,759
prevent light leaks in their grow tent

668
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,070
this is where some people are hanging

669
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,930
blackout curtains around the tent to

670
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:11,029
create a little dressing room for the

671
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,460
tent to prevent light leaks people are

672
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:15,950
using fabric curtains or some people are

673
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,870
using stuff like panda film or poly film

674
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,640
to create a little layer of protection

675
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:21,229
between the tent and the outside

676
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,700
environment now I don't know where

677
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,779
everybody is putting their grow tent

678
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,370
some people have it in a spare bedroom

679
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,170
some people have got it in the basement

680
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:29,059
some people just have it out in the

681
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,220
garage I'm not sure what you've got set

682
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,659
up but if it is in a room where there is

683
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,190
a lot of light and you were concerned

684
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,630
with light getting into the tent this

685
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,180
may be something you could think about

686
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,680
if you are not able to use panda film or

687
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,720
some sort of poly film because you need

688
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,670
to stay stealth something like a black

689
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,500
sheet right around the tent doesn't make

690
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,390
a big difference it still looks like the

691
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,220
black tent and it still works as a

692
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,230
concealment if you don't want to hang a

693
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,940
big privacy curtain around the grow tent

694
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,069
you can just make a little flap on the

695
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,450
inside or the outside of the tent just a

696
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:58,009
little bit of velcro like our friend was

697
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,630
talking about here and a little bit of

698
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:01,309
fabric and a little bit of creativity

699
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,980
you can solve all of these problems

700
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:05,569
without stressing yourself out but it

701
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,099
mostly depends on the quality of the

702
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,419
tent are you getting a lot of large

703
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,730
light leaks are you getting just a

704
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,500
couple of small pinholes or do we really

705
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,120
need to prevent a lot of light from

706
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,859
getting in that is when you make the

707
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,299
decision to use a little bit of tape can

708
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,799
I use a couple of pieces of tape just to

709
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:20,509
stick those over these little pin holes

710
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
and prevent that light coming in you can

711
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,900
use a little bit of fabric and make a

712
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,400
little velcro curtain or do you actually

713
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,720
need to make a little privacy curtain

714
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,429
around the grow tent

715
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,409
prevent light from getting into your

716
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:32,360
plants but big shout-out to our buddy

717
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,860
ridge here our buddy ridge says that

718
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,109
he's using blackout curtains and it

719
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:38,209
works well then ridge was brilliant

720
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:39,979
enough to use that stoner ingenuity they

721
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,600
got some velcro and they put velcro at

722
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,980
the top of the tent and at the bottom of

723
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,750
that curtain and all they got to do now

724
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,819
is just velcro that up there and they've

725
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,859
got a little easy access a little bit of

726
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:51,079
workspace without a lot of work so use

727
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:52,849
that stoner ingenuity don't let little

728
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,798
problems stress you out in the grow room

729
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:57,079
smoke a fat joint a little bit of

730
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,339
creativity will go a long way alright I

731
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,288
want to give a big shot at our buddy

732
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:02,538

760
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,129
a big thank you is above well deserved

761
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:08,658
you can say my name is Reese hey Reese

762
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,580
thank you for the great compliment I

763
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:12,740
love hearing that people are learning

764
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:14,960
from our podcasts if you were listening

765
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,490
to the embracing organics podcast and

766
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,429
you're listening to my show you are

767
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,099
absolutely getting a good solid cannabis

768
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,630
education foundation if you enjoy my

769
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:25,548
show and if you're enjoying the

770
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,130
embracing organic show I think you would

771
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,779
also enjoy the dude grows show so if

772
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,000
you're not already listening to the dude

773
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:33,740
grow show I would strongly suggest that

774
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,179
you give them a subscribe and a listen

775
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,058
because you will learn a lot from them

776
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,500
as well then when you're ready to expand

777
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:40,490
your knowledge I think you can learn

778
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,679
even more

779
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,170
from the cannabis cultivation and

780
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,120
Sciences podcast with tad Hussey and I

781
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,390
really strongly suggest to the shaping

782
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,428
fire podcast with Shango lows so get a

783
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,590
good foundation with the dude grows with

784
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,759
my show and with embracing organics then

785
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:57,199
when you're ready to step up a little

786
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,269
bit that's when you want to check out

787
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,220
cannabis cultivation and Sciences with

788
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:03,710
tad Hussey and I would also again

789
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,210
suggest shaping fire with Shango low so

790
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,549
those are two other podcasts that will

791
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,500
really expand your cannabis growing

792
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:11,659
knowledge now let's jump back into the

793
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,119
email there is more it says can you shed

794
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,690
some light on why I get purple stems

795
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:20,569
from time to time then they fade back to

796
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,789
green this is a great question but

797
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:25,099
without more details without more info

798
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,440
or maybe some photos it is going to be

799
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:30,199
hard for me to accurately diagnose what

800
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,240
is happening with your plan fortunately

801
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,330
what I can say is that a little bit of

802
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,190
purple stem is probably not too much of

803
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:39,139
a problem this could be a couple of

804
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,610
things again I don't know what else is

805
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,170
happening in your grow I don't know

806
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,789
about your temperatures I don't know

807
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,500
about your humidity I don't know about

808
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,970
your diurnal shifts I don't know

809
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,470
anything about what's going on in that

810
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,360
room other than you've got some ganja

811
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,190
plants in there and they're getting some

812
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,899
purple stems so with the little

813
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,100
information I've got let's talk about

814
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,019
what it could be this could be

815
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:58,969
temperature related depending on where

816
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:00,170
this is happening in the plant what part

817
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,940
of the plant this could be from the

818
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,308
plant getting cold are you getting cold

819
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,740
night temperatures are you having warm

820
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,990
daytime temps and then lower nighttime

821
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,150
temperatures that can absolutely

822
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,099
encourage purple stems now by purple

823
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,990
stems do you mean the main stalk of the

824
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:17,599
plant do you mean the branches or do you

825
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,509
mean the pea Deol's the actual stems of

826
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,730
the leaves if the tops of the pea deals

827
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:24,769
are turning purple maybe a reddish color

828
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,529
that is possibly because they are

829
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,450
getting too cold now this can also be a

830
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:32,210
nutrient issue this could be phosphorus

831
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,069
or potassium related but again since I

832
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,230
can't see the plants since I can't see

833
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:37,428
your pol grow monitor information and

834
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,470
tell you what's been happening in that

835
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,170
grow for the past few weeks it is hard

836
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,360
for me to diagnose the problem one hint

837
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,429
is that you say the plants turn you get

838
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,308
purple stems from time to time and then

839
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,870
they fade back to green in my mind that

840
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:52,399
makes me think that it is probably a

841
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:54,289
temperature issue they're getting too

842
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,790
cold overnight one time

843
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:57,319
then they get really purple from that

844
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,399
but over the next few days they start

845
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,750
warming up and they started getting

846
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,700
green again and going back to their

847
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,410
normal life then you're probably getting

848
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,819
another cold snap and those plants are

849
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,560
getting those purple stems all over

850
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:08,629
again and it's probably freaking you out

851
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,789
which makes sense this could be

852
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,800
nutrients this could be temperature this

853
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:14,960
could also simply be something that that

854
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,789
plant does it could be genetics as that

855
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,620
plant grows it may turn purple at one

856
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:21,079
point and then it also may go right back

857
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:23,449
to green how experienced are you with

858
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,099
that particular plant is it one strain

859
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,539
that's doing it is it one phenotype

860
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:29,089
that's doing it or is it the entire

861
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:31,730
garden is it one section is it one row

862
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:33,740
is it one area without having more

863
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,140
information it is really hard for me to

864
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,180
pinpoint and diagnose the exact problem

865
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,920
I would start by checking on temperature

866
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,470
then I would check out the nutrients

867
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,810
then I would start dialing it in row by

868
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,670
row plant by plant and start eliminating

869
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,859
things that it could be and that will

870
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,330
show you what it actually is but that's

871
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:52,369
the best I can do for you with the

872
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,379
limited information that I have got I do

873
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:56,149
want to thank you again for listening to

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,340
the dude grows podcast if you want me to

878
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,319
follow up with this question

879
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:08,720
send me some details what's happening in

880
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,220
your grow do you know what the nighttime

881
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,960
temperatures are do you know what the

882
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,690
daytime temperatures are do you know

883
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,160
what the VPD is in the night and day do

884
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,200
you know what you've been feeding these

885
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,700
plants for the past few weeks are you in

886
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,400
veg are you in flower

887
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,470
are you indoors are you outdoors I would

888
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,259
like a lot more information and I may be

889
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,850
able to dial in and diagnose the problem

890
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,559
if there even is a problem with your

891
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:32,269
plant the good news is a little bit of

892
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,309
purpling might not even be a problem

893
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,990
this could just be genetics

894
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,490
all right Reese I want to thank you once

895
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,049
