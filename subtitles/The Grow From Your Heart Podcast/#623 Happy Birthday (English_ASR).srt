00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,879
yours truly ross to jeff i had a really

154
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,439
good time on that podcast i had a lot of

155
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,519
fun

156
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,360
i was trying not to interrupt too much

157
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,959
because we know that our friend scotty

158
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
real does kind of butt in a little bit

159
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,638
with a lot of stuff to say i didn't want

160
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,399
to overrun the show because i'm not the

161
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
a regular member of that show i wanted

162
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,959
to be a good gracious guest

163
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,560
also had to fill my shoes had to pull my

164
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,239
own weight and be involved so

165
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,519
it's hard to find that borderline there

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
but i think we did a good job on the

167
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,758
show

168

178
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,680
i wrote down the words super stoney

179
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,120
tolerance swings holy [ __ ] i may have

180
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,079
talked about this in the past on the

181
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,959
show it may have

182
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,319
been a long time how about you right now

183
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,399
i'm going through a phase

184
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,000
where i can basically open up my jar of

185
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,038
concentrates and just look at it

186
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,478
and be stoned out of my [ __ ] dome i

187
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,159
go through phases where

188
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,599
uh the guy at the dispensary is like bro

189
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
you were here yesterday and i'm like i

190
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
know

191
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360
i know trust me i know and then i go

192
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,799
through phases like today where i could

193
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
just look at the jar and be

194
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
[ __ ] wrecked all day long right now

195
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
i'm going through one of those phases

196
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
where i can take one dab and i get

197
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,159
so high and then i go through it'll

198
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
probably last a week maybe three days

199
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
four or five days maybe a week tops and

200
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,919
then next week i'll go buy concentrates

201
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,519
and i will smoke all of the concentrates

202
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,839
and not even get a nice buzz

203
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,599
so do you go through weird shifts and

204
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,758
swings in your tolerance

205
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
i definitely notice it is based on a lot

206
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,960
of it's based on my hydration i haven't

207
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
been hydrating properly i've been

208
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,359
a little extra uh physically busy been

209
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,800
working a little bit more physically

210
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
been in a grow a little bit more and

211
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
that's dehydrating me a little bit i'm

212
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,318
wondering if that's contributing to

213
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
the extra buzz i've been getting uh my

214
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
diet has changed a little honestly been

215
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,879
eating more food

216
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,399
and still getting extra high when i

217
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,918
smoke so i'm curious

218
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,000
send me some feedback wherever you

219
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,038
interact with me uh do you go through

220
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,879
phases where

221
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,279
sometimes you can smoke all of the

222
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,038
product and not get stoned at all

223
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,478
and then sometimes you go through phases

224
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,759
where you smoke a little bit of the

225
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,478
product and you're [ __ ] wrecked for

226
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,319
the day

227
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,599
do you go through phases ebbs and flows

228
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,280

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
out of this but this is required

264
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,400
uh as a responsible uh person with a

435

436
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,159
into the grow lessons again

437
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,639
um but back in the day the show was

438
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,319
called the igrow culture podcast i

439
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
started off with igrow culture as

440
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
episode one

441
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,200
it was a play on like ipad ipod i

442
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,119
everything it was a lowercase i and then

443
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,000
the word grow with a capital g

444
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
i grow like ipad uh you know what i'm

445
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
saying right all the apple stuff

446
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
so as i grow culture uh because it was

447
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
the i

448
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,799
grow i was growing some culture i was

449
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,039
growing cannabis culture

450
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,559
i was growing we were cultivating and it

451
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,480
was also a play on the word

452
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,399
agriculture is where i was going with

453
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,759
that agroculture

454
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,440
i was also a little bit of when you put

455
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,879
i and stuff it makes a little rastafari

456
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
i feel that's a whole nother avenue if

457
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,000
you understand the rastafari lingo then

458
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,278
you get that but

459
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,078
um about 30 or 40 episodes into the

460
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,399
igrow culture

461
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,638
podcast i received a cease and desist

462
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,919
letter from a company called

463
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,039
igrow culture that's right they were a

464
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:35,039
a college accredited company who made

465
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,759
courses for colleges for agricultural

466
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,599
studies

467
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,278
so they were teaching like ag schools

468
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,959
they were the ones making the books for

469
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,639
the agriculture schools

470
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,198
and they kindly said hey we see you've

471
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,839
got a new podcast or a few episodes in

472
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,439
we would appreciate it if you stop using

473
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,600
the word agroculture

474
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
and if you do continue to use that then

475
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
we will have to have our lawyers

476
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,198
step in and sue the [ __ ] out of you it's

477
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,439
not exactly what they said

478
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,799
i'm paraphrasing but that was when i

479
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,560
decided you know i don't really like the

480
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,958
word i grow culture anyway

481
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,599
i thought about it uh my company is the

482
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,838
growth or

483
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,639
my company is irie genetics premium

484
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,279

485
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,278
the slogan for ire genetics was grow

486
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,639

487
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,559

heart is what we do it's what i do it's

in right in the middle

512
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,479

513
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,799

514
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,399

516
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,078
it's been so long

517
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,919
but many of you jumped in when the video

518
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,679
started on youtube so thank you for that

519
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,278

520
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,719
have been here since the beginning and

521
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,399

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
been listening to me for seven years

523
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
what blows my mind is when somebody says

524
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,799

525
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,720

and i've already listened to like 400

527
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,759
episodes or something of your show and

528
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
i'm like oh my goodness

529
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
these people have heard me from back in

530
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,919
the day i used to write out entire

531
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,120
podcasts like type them out on paper and

532
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,240
read it like a script

533
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,759
so today we will be doing episode 325 of

534
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,159
the grow from your heart podcast

535
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,879

seedsharenow.com make sure

537
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,240
and i would just read it like that and i

538
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,519
didn't i didn't flow i didn't feel good

539
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,879
and now i just turn on the mic and i've

540
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,639
got like five bullet points on the

541
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,078
screen and we just [ __ ] talk for 30

542
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
or 40 minutes and hopefully

543
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,758
don't have to edit too much [ __ ] out the

544
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,559
show has progressed i feel like i have

545
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,399
grown

546
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,559
so far as a podcaster i feel like i've

547
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,039
grown a lot as a cultivator

548
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,000
uh a commercial cultivator a home

549
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,838
cultivator

550
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,198
also i feel like i've grown so much as a

551
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
teacher i understand

552
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,639

554
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,959
uh man i feel like we've come a long way

555
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
together so my main point of that ramble

556
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,119

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240

562
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,519

564
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,759

progression

568
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,758
i went from having a terrible audio

569
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,039
quality sound that was over compressed

570
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,159
and sound tinny

571
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,360
i focused way too much on just the wrong

572
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,319
stuff i didn't know i was new at

573
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
podcasting

574
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
then we improved the sound then we

575
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,879
improved the video now we're in 4k

576
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,359
uh most of the time it's in 4k i record

577
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,439
in 4k sometimes youtube doesn't

578
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,879
[ __ ] let me post it in 4k but that's

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
will still big shout out to all those

664
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,759
people that were on the show without you

665
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
guys the show wouldn't have existed

666
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,720
and people say hey why do you leave up

667
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
some of those episodes that person has

668
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,919
proved themselves to be a phony

669
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
or has proved themselves to be a fool

670
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
since they were on your show why do you

671
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,160
leave it up

672
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
i can't change history taking down a

673
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,320
podcast episode is not going to change

674
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,000
the fact that we were cool at that point

675
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,839
that we were friends at that point

676
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
that episode that knowledge that info is

677
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,879
still probably valid

678
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,960
and then we can see what that person has

679
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
evolved into some people have changed

680
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,319
some people wearing masks

681
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,679
some people have really evolved into

682
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,200
bigger and better people some people

683
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,320
have been abandoned and deleted and

684
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
blocked completely

685
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,759
so the reason i don't take down those

686
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,279
messages or those old episodes is

687
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,038
because it's a time capsule

688
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,440
uh the podcast happened those things

689
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,798
were said i'm kind of a historian here

690
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
doing this so that's why some of the

691
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,879
episodes if you ask why do you leave

692
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
that up

693
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
it's a time capsule can't change history

694
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,759
just by deleting an episode

695
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
can't change the future by deleting an

696
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,640
episode all right

697
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,319
so thanks to all of the guests past

698
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
present and future even if we don't kick

699
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,639
it anymore

700
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
even if i don't rep your brand or you

701
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,520
don't wrap my [ __ ] thank you

702
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,519
it was still worth having you on the

703
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,279
show uh also

704
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,839
thank you to all of the shows which have

705
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,079
had me as a guest

706
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,759
i've been on a lot of podcasts i think

707
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,558
the first show i appeared on may have

708
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,000
been

709
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:38,480
john doe radio with tim martin

710
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
what that's some old school [ __ ] tim i'd

711
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
love to see you get moving again you

712
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
talk about getting it fired up

713
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
maybe you've gotten it going i haven't

714
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
seen it on itunes i look for you

715
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,599
occasionally

716
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,959
if the john doe radio fired up again i

717
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,639
would give it a follow

718
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,159
uh but tim martin was one of the reasons

719
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,400
why i started the show

720
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
uh his show inspired me there were a lot

721
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
of shows that inspired me we don't need

722
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,359
to go too far into that

723
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,119
but i was talking a lot about cannabis

724
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,719
teaching my friends and then somebody

725
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,079
asked me the same question like three

726
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,279
times in a row and i thought i should

727
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,798
record this and do it that's why a

728
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,480
podcast started but

729
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,558
thanks to all the people that had me as

730
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,599
a guest i was on john doe radio that got

731
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,440
me started

732
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,158
i've been on the dude grows show i've

733
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,480
been on medical marijuana radio with our

734
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
friend

735
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,519
ls love down there in new mexico i've

736
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,679
been on

737
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,599
okay so here's one we should really make

738
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
sure to touch on

739
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,199
big shout out to the gang at embracing

740
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,279
organics

741
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,519
embracing organics invited me to be on

742
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,798
their video zoom podcast which goes live

743
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,879
on youtube

744
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,279
i was hesitant for a couple of reasons

745
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,039
at the time i wasn't doing video shows

746
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,000
i wasn't prepared or comfortable to go

747
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,879
on video also i wasn't doing live shows

748
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,519
at the time

749
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
so i was about to be on camera live that

750
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,759
was really nerve-wracking it was a

751
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
little uh

752
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,519
made me nervous to be honest with you

753
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,038
but we did it and after that there was

754
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,960
no turning back now i get on the

755
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,640
microphone and i talk and i ramble

756
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,319
and this is like where i live this is my

757
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,000
space right here i feel so good in the

758
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,599
podcasting zone

759
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,279
i don't know that i would have gotten

760
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,639
comfortable on the video i don't know

761
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,798
that i would have learned the live

762
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,360
zoom stuff without my buddy dirt man dan

763
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:12,158
and the embracing organics crew

764
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,038
so we all owe a special thank you to

765
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,240
dirt man dan

766
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,158
and embracing organics because i

767
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
wouldn't be doing this show the way i'm

768
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,960
doing it

769
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,279
uh without that encouragement without

770
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,120
that shift without that boost

771
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,720
it was good practice and it got me going

772
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,239
so thank you bro you guys really did

773
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,038

917
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,359
i did notice that when i record on zoom

918
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,278
my video comes out super grainy i think

919
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,959
i've resolved that issue i talked about

920
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,960
that in a previous episode

921
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,400
i'm still learning you guys uh just like

922
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000

923
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,278
this stuff so be patient

924
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,359
stick with it um i don't want to make

925
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,159
any promises but i'm going to need to do

926
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,319
that third

927
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,080
episode maybe every other week or

928
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,678
something maybe do a bonus one or two

929
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,519
extra episodes every month because i

930
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,240
can't fit in all of the questions from

931
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,319
patreon and all the patreon shout outs

932
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
so if things keep going well if we stay

933
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,839
above 200 patrons

934
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,079
things go like they are i'm going to

935
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,720
have to do that third episode i owe it

936
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,599
to you

937
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,360
so thank you for that um i had a couple

938
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,119
of things in the way of my time i'm

939
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,918
getting better at time management

940
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,599
i had a health concern that turned out

941
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,200
to be a false alarm

942
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,398
so that is out of the way that's a

943
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
little bit of stress i don't have to

944
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:38,959
worry about

945
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,399
that helps me uh focus a little bit more

946
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,360
on the podcasting also i don't have to

947
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,119
go to the doctor

948
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,639
and figure out what the [ __ ] is going on

949
