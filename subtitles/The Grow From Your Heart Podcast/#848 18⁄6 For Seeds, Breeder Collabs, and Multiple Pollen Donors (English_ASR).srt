39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,719
that's right uh the sphere does not pay

40
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,759
me to talk about this the sphere does

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,359
not pay me to advertise but I'll talk

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,560
briefly about it maybe maybe some of you

43
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,200
just don't know uh the sphere is a new

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,159
venue in Las Vegas it is a big sphere

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,118
it's a big ball the outside of the

46
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,799
sphere is all a big LED screen I don't

47
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,239
know how to explain the technology but

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,280
they are constantly displaying crazy

49
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,640
video displays on the outside of screen

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,840
it's amazing um you can just drive by or

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,759
walk by the sphere or even fly by the

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,319
sphere and see amazing visual displays

53
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,759
on the outside but once you get in it is

54
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,159
even more amazing uh before the show

55
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,039
starts it feels sort of like you're

56
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,318
stuck in an iPad or you're a screen

57
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,878
saver but once the music gets going it

58
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,159
is amazing there's a

59
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:25,199
270° screen inside the sphere that means

60
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,719
everywhere you look except behind you is

61
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,919
a video screen so dead end company who

62
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,560
are the uh there are two remaining

63
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,958
members of the Grateful Dead that still

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
play and they filled in the rest of the

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,920
band with some amazing players uh they

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,598
call themselves dead in company but two

67
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,639
remaining members of the Grateful Dead

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,439
tour with the rest of the band and the

69
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,000
dead and Company nailed it at the fear

70
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,359
they put on an amazing show the last two

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,959
shows were extra awesome uh the night

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,480
before the last show was actually the

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,719
29th anniversary of the passing of Jerry

74
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,759
Garcia who was the lead guitar player in

75
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,919
the band for several years uh then he

76
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,359
passed in '95 they've had several

77
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,719
incantations or incarnations of the band

78
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,360
since then uh currently they've got John

79
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,280
Mayer playing guitar which a lot of

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,920
people think is wild at first I didn't

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,318
want to like it either seeing John Mayer

82
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,719
with the Grateful Dead but after the

83
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,359
first time I saw him play uh I knew that

84
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,519
he was the guy for the job and he's been

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,440
doing it for several years and he

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,158
absolutely crushed it at the sphere uh

87
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,239
dead and Co was amazing the last two

88
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,120
shows were amazing the sphere was

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,319
amazing uh the sphere visuals were super

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,438
amazing I've gotten to see uh four fish

91
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,438
shows and two deaden company shows and

92
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,400
the visuals that dead end company put on

93
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,438
were amazing um also everybody at the

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,640
sphere is super helpful and amazing they

95
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:41,598
don't pay me to talk about it I think

96
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,079
I've said that uh The Spar and deaden

97
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,518
company definitely did not pay me for

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,560
this free advertising but if you get an

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,239
opportunity to go see a band that you

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,799
like at the sphere I highly recommend it

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,000
it is it is an amazing experience it's

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,920
easy to get in it's easy to get out uh

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,158
the drinks lines and snack lines are

104
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,438
easy there's never a real long line uh

105
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,078

106
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,039

knowledge I feel like if I didn't share

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,160

148

explode there's something I've been

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
given a Gift of Gab I've been given the

150
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,319
gift to understand cannabis plants if I

151
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,198
didn't share that with you I would be

152
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,120
disrespectful to whatever you believe in

153
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,000
they gave me this gift so I am rambly

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
and I love talking about cannabis so

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,600

breeding answer for you it says let's

161
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,400
just say I have a female that has some

162
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,000
desirable traits and it is valuable to

163
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,959
reverse it and use it as a donor plant

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
all right I understand where you're

165
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,839
going with that you've got a female

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,160
plant with the traits you want to take

167
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,478
two clones of it reverse one use one as

168
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,840
a donor one as a receiver you can make

169
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,159
S1 seeds and preserve this plant so far

170
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,399
this makes very beautiful sense now

171
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,280
here's where it get gets weird it says

172
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,198
uh can I do this while still using a

173
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,559
male plant as a donor as well so they

174
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,400
want to take that pollen from that

175
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,280
reversed female and they also want to

176
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,439
take pollen from a traditional male

177
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,439
plant and put both of those batches of

178
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,399
pollen on their single female pollen

179
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,000
receiver plant I understand that part so

180
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,079
far I don't recommend it however I do

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,879
understand it it goes on it says since

182
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,120
our favorite plant can take multiple

183
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,159
pollen at once how will this affect the

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,319
seeds since the Reversed pollen will

185
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,319
only have female chromosomes all right I

186
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,840
understand what you're asking um how

187
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,000
it's going to affect the seeds is you're

188
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,279
going to have seeds uh with different

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,439
baby daddies you're going to have a

190
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,239
whole bunch of Mori Povich uh sort of

191
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,680
stuff going on you're going to get that

192
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,038
feminized pollen is going to hit the

193
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,360
plant and make feminized seeds all of

194
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,878
those seeds will be female that will be

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,960
your S1 so if we took that one plant and

196
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,759
the same plant pollinated it that is an

197
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:19,519
S1 there will be also other seeds in

198
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,199
there that will be f1s from that male

199
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,758
that you pollinated that plant with now

200
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,879
those seeds what they're going to do

201
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,199
they're going to make male and female

202
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,599
seeds uh we can tell that the pollen is

203
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,800
what determines sex and my science in my

204
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,159
thinking pollen is what determines sex

205
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,840
why do I believe that feminized seeds

206
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm using fem pollen to make fem seeds

207
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,799
is what I'm doing so I believe that the

208
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,720
uh the sex is determined by the pollen

209
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
just like when males and females breed

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,440
that male sperm does contain the it

211
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,919
determines the sex of the the the

212
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,719
progyny seeds in cannabis are just like

213
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,120
that the male pollen does hold that male

214
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,759
or female chromosome so if I take

215
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,519
feminized pollen and I put it on that

216
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
plant we're only going to get female

217
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,198
seeds if I take that male plant and put

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
it on there we're going to get male and

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
female seeds from that because the

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,639
pollen does come or the sex does come

221
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,799
from the pollen so what you're going to

222
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,439
find is you're going to find male plants

223
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,158
you're going to find female plants

224
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,519
you'll also find feminized plants but

225
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,478
you won't know if they're feminized

226
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,318
because they're going to come just like

227
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,839
the regular female plants you won't know

228
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
they'll be girls so you're going to get

229
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,038
a bunch of girl plants probably and

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,879
you're going to have male plants pop up

231
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,318
in here I don't like this idea because I

232
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,519
am a a commercial seed maker a

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,839
commercial seed seller I need to know

234
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,918
the pedigree of every single seed which

235
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,680
I sell I can't have something where I

236
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,799
say it could be this Dad or it could be

237
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,239
this Dad that doesn't work for me that

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,919
doesn't work for the market that doesn't

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,639
work for my breeding uh my goals my my

240
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,000
project if you want to do this you can

241
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:55,240
just know that you've got what I call a

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,799
Mori poic situation on your hand who is

243
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,039
the baby daddy who is not the father

244
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,359
when you grow these out you're going to

245
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,958
get a bunch bu of wild different

246
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,759
phenotypes because you've got an S1

247
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,119
making that phenotype or those

248
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,919
phenotypes and then you've got a full

249
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,320
new F1 hybrid showing those phenotypes

250
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,679
in there so you're going to see a bunch

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
of different variation and you may be

252
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,679
able to identify what's what but you may

253
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,000
not and as a breeder I like to know

254
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,759
where uh what my project is doing I like

255
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,799
to know what that male did to the female

256
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,838
and what the female did to the female

257
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,919
this is kind of just making a mess in my

258
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,640
opinion if you want to do this just to

259
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,479
make a bunch of seeds to have some seeds

260
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,360
to play with and some [ __ ] chaos in a

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,079
grow that's perfect but don't sell these

262
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
don't give them away don't trade them

263
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,919
these are for you these are your private

264
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,079
stash for you to play with you knew what

265
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,559
you did you're accepting the risk you're

266
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,359
accepting that outcome just you don't

267
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,958
don't Pawn these off on anybody else and

268
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,278
make them deal with your Mori your Mori

269
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,000
Povich situation I do have more notes

270
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,799
written down here um it says Mory poic

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,519
is what my note says and then it says

272
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,559
you will have some regs and some fem uh

273
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,399
you're going to see a lot of different

274
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,078
phenotypes and you basically got two

275
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,320
dads in there this plant just basically

276
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,399
got knocked up by two different dads and

277
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,200
you get to guess who the baby daddy is

278
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,039
on all the progyny when you grow them

279
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,519
out so let me reread this make sure we

280
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,679
covered everything make sure we got it

281
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,759
right um let's see I've got a female has

282
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,479
some desirable traits reverse it and

283
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,600
also use a male donor yes I see where

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,120
we're going uh multiple pollins yes it

285
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,120
will receive multiple pollin at once but

286
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
all the seeds are also going to come out

287
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,278
uh it's like random seeds it's like just

288
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
playing a guessing game you don't know

289
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,799
what did what so so like I said if you

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
do want to make these seeds and do it

291
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,719
for fun have a good time uh don't give

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
them away don't sell them don't trade

293
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,920
them this is your Frankenstein for you

294
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,519
to play with why not just do it twice

295
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,838
why not just pollinate this plant make

296
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,879
the fem seeds uh wait a little while do

297
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,320
another project make reg seeds that's

298
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,439
what I would recommend that would be

299
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,160
much more strategic and much more

300
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,959
beneficial for the future of cannabis

301
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,278
when we're breeding my theory my idea is

302
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,838
to uh improve upon the plant if you've

303
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:01,600
got plant a and plant be and they're

304
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
both eights or nines and you're breeding

305
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
with two eights or two nines or a nine

306
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,680
and a eight hopefully you got two t but

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,279
I understand that's really I don't even

308
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,638
have two t I'm super [ __ ] picky but

309
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,720
hopefully you take two eights or two

310
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,320
nins and you breed them and you come out

311
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,839
with a solid 9.5 or maybe even a 10 if

312
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,560
you breed two eights together and you

313
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,800
come out with a six or a seven you done

314
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,599
[ __ ] up you did not do us any service

315
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,319
all you did at that point was make seeds

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
and anybody can make seeds that's when

317
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,320
you're pollen chucking that is my uh

318
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,440
public service announcement for this

319
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,959
plant if you're going to be a breeder

320
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,399
the goal is to improve upon the genetics

321
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,159
of the plant and in my opinion in my

322
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,480
standards U Mory poit [ __ ] is not

323
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,278
considered improving uh what if you find

324
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
something Stellar you've got a cool

325

326
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480

327
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,000
about that some don't the breeder in me

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,959
really really does all right my dude

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,839
Shaggy grow thank you for the good

330
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,439
question you got me rambling pretty good

331
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,040
make sure you check your inbox and do

332
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,600
check your spam folder because you've

333
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,679
got a coupon code for a free free pack

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,800
of seedss from idirect decom I hate that

335
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,679
I've got to say this one more time but

336
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,278
there will be an expiration date on your

337
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,679
coupon code that will be a real

338
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,879
expiration date that coupon will expire

339
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,719
at that day it will no longer be valid

340
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,360
you'll try to use it and it will go

341
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,839
it'll be just like the Family Feud Steve

342
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,919
Harvey will be like can I see

343
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
coupon no coupon bro there will not be a

344
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,719
coupon this tells me two things if you

345
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,519
don't use your coupon by the time that

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
it it expires cuz I give you plenty of

347
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,039
time in my opinion tells me a couple

348
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,199
things first you didn't check your email

349
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,159
all you got to do is check your email

350
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,120
check your spam folder that coupon code

351
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,078
will be there second the second thing it

352
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,078
tells me when I read your question on

353
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:44,799
the show you didn't watch the episode

354
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,759
because if you saw the episode with your

355
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,719
question most people I'm sure that

356
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,759
shaggy right now before he even finished

357
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,959
he pressed pause or he's doing something

358
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,319
he just [ __ ] pulled out the computer

359
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,919
he's like bro I got free seeds he's

360
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,278
already pulling up the coupon code

361
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,838
that's how it works if you're driving

362
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,600
you get home you go buy the seeds right

363
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,320
away so if you haven't got the coupon

364
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,759
code before it expires it tells me

365
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,920
you're not checking your email which you

366
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,439
should probably be doing anyway and also

367
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,679
it tells me you didn't even listen to

368
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,959
the show so that's why you didn't get

369
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,719
the free seeds because you didn't even

370
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,399
listen to the episode where your

371
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,160
question was read I give you most of the

372
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,600
time four to six weeks on those coupon

373
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,399
codes so when it expires guess what it

374
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,079
expired I kind of

375
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
apologize kind of don't all right we're

376
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:26,039
going to keep this momentum going I've

377
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,360
got another great question here in front

378
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,919
of me this one came from Frank White

379
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,519
sounds like a movie character Frank

380
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,919
White what's up dude I hope everything's

381
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,759

382
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,120
question says what's up rosta Jeff

383
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,360

384
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,000
great question my dude make sure you

385
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,480
check your inbox check that spam folder

386
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,919
because like I said you've got a coupon

387
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,199
code for a free pack of seeds and I

388
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,599
would hate for it to expire now the

389
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:50,758
question says first and foremost I

390
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,920
appreciate what you do for the community

391
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,199
your show has been a great listen on the

392
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,360
drive to work and while working in the

393
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,120

395
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,360

396
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,919
time on the way to work and in the

397
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,919
garden I listen to a lot of podcasts so

398
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,198

399
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,159
can give that back to you it says I've

400
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,758
got two questions for you today well my

401
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,198
dude I'm only going to send you one

402
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,240
coupon code but I will read both of your

403
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,958
questions the first one says how do you

404
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,360
feel about collaborating with other

405
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,319
breeders I totally understand testing

406
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
quality control selection preferences

407
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,680
Etc can make things complicated but I

408
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,198
was hoping to get your opinion on the

409
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,519
topic that's a really good question

410
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,639
collabs with other

411
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,679
breeders um a lot of us breeders are

412
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,839
very picky a lot of us breeders are very

413
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,879
um I can't even think of the word I'm

414
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,399
trying to say meticulous um words in

415
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,519
that vein we like to do things our way

416
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,078
some of us don't play well with others I

417
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,959
like to play well with others I try but

418
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,838
we're very um we're breeders for a

419
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,719
reason a lot of us came from this

420
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,839
background before everything was legal

421
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,360
um some of us are criminals some of us

422
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,720
are uh we come come from Criminal back

423
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,120
background and we are uh more used to

424
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
and more familiar kind of hiding in the

425
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
shadows and doing this [ __ ] on our own

426
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,000
because back in the day you couldn't

427
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,399
tell anybody what you were doing if I

428
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,639
told people back in the day that I was

429
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,879
growing ganja uh they would either rob

430
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,360
me or snitch on me or some [ __ ] would go

431
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,320
wrong so we had to keep it on the down

432
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,720
low and also that is part of what uh

433
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,600
traumatized a lot of us we are a lot of

434
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,040
us old school Growers and breeders are a

435
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,920
little bit broken we're used to looking

436
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,240
over our shoulder uh we're used to

437
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,759
worrying about [ __ ] we're used to not

438
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,919
trusting anybody because that's how it

439
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,759
used to be I know it's unhealthy uh I go

440
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,198
to [ __ ] therapy now to try to fix

441
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,519
that [ __ ] to be honest with you but um a

442
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,958
lot of us are a little bit broken

443
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,519
because we've been doing illegal

444
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,838
activity it's hard to trust people it's

445
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,318
hard to have good friends it's hard to

446
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,199
build real relationships uh when you're

447
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,599
looking over your shoulder and worried

448
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,359
about your best friend maybe trying to

449
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,079
rob you steal from you so that a lot of

450
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,278
us come from that background a lot of us

451
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,479
know the risks a lot of us have made a

452
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,039
lot of the Breeders have made good

453
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,120
friends cuz we all come from the same

454
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,799
thing we understand uh that history of

455
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,720
our lives but a lot of us don't play

456
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,240
well with others so it's a little bit

457
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,720
easier to just do it by yourself now

458
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,399
there are several breeders out there

459
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,800
that I would love to collab with and I

460
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,000
know that we would work well shout out

461
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,758
to Jinx Proof I want to work with Jinx

462
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,639
uh big shout out to Brad from raw Jinx

463
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,039
and ra Brad are the first two I think of

464
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,198
when it comes to doing a collab but

465
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,039
we've talked about it um and it never

466
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,838
comes to fruition I'm not blaming them

467
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,399
they're not blaming me we're busy

468
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,040
[ __ ] people we're doing our own thing

469
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,759
and to get two breeders on the same

470
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,000
schedule with the same idea to make a

471
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,560
plan that's a whole another ball game

472
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,958
for us to line up and we're already kind

473
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,919
of doing our thing uh Jinx has a family

474
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,000
Jinx is doing things where for Autism

475
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,519
Awareness Rose and Jinx stay super busy

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,559
with jinxy JR I'd love to work with them

477
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,399

484
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,159
I'm just saying the the time just hasn't

485
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,078
happened for all of that I like to I

486
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,399
would enjoy it but a lot of us would

487
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,480
rather just stick to ourselves and uh

488
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,319
play on our own we don't play well with

489
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,199
others because of the history I'm

490
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,678
learning I'm growing I'm maturing I'm

491
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,880
much better at playing with others at

492
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,199
this point but um it just hasn't come to

493
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,000
fruition now what does happen is

494
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,199
somebody's out there yelling it already

495
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,720
it's probably Tardis uh yelling at the

496
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,439
screen going what about forced collabs

497
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,120
almost everything a breeder does is a

498
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,600
forced collab if I take a plant uh let's

499
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,239
talk about the

500
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,480
um the the Cherry Paloma Cherry Paloma

501
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,160
came from Brad at Raw so I guess I have

502
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,880
collab with Brad from raw even though he

503
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
doesn't know it um I got the Jr token

504
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,919
Cherry Paloma cut everybody had that cut

505
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,000
for a little while I've taken that cut

506
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,280
and I've bred it to a couple of things I

507
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,599
BR it to something that I originated and

508
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,160
I bred it to some stuff that other

509
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,439
breeders also have originated so in a

510
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,240
sense I am force collabing with Brad

511
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,320
from raw uh there is some of my stuff

512
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,759
bred to several of or several of my

513
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,279
things bred to to his Cherry Paloma I

514
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,480
reversed a couple things H the Cherry

515
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,240
Paloma the skunk number one mainly um

516
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,038
also there's a uh BC Lemon Skunk to

517
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,640
Cherry Paloma there's a bunch of great

518
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,839
stuff out there that I've made with the

519
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,280
Cherry so I am forced collabing with

520
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,279
Brad from raw and it it's not that Brad

521
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,678
and I don't have a thing going on we

522
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,038
didn't talk about it or anything I just

523
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,400
had that plant and I pollinated it it

524
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,720
just makes it easier there's no I'm

525
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
doing my thing my business my sales my

526
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,558
way and he can do his thing we don't

527
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,360
have to will always be friends because

528
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,279
there will never be a business argument

529
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,038
that's one thing that I like uh with the

530
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,599
way that I just did this Brad wasn't

531
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,079
involved I'm not involved in Brad's

532
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,079
stuff when I see Brad it's all

533
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,558
friendship it's hey bro taste how good

534
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,558
this weed smokes and tastes uh smell how

535
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,079
good this jar smells it's not like hey

536
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,440
do you have the money for those seeds

537
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,439
because that [ __ ] sucks there is

538
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,759
business that gets in the way of things

539
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,519
so that's part of why I don't like to

540
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,079
work with the other breeders cuz money

541
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,558
[ __ ] up friendships I'll always be

542
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,038
friends with Jinx if we don't ever

543
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,279
collab I'll always be friends uh so I

544
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,000
guess I put them in the friend zone is

545
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,399
what I'm technically saying we're all in

546
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
each other's friend zone that way we get

547
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,120
to stay friends I'd rather have friends

548
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,038
than money at this point uh business is

549
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,798
going friendships are blooming let's not

550
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,720
mix the two don't [ __ ] where you eat is

551
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,359
also another phrase that they say it's

552
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,360
not that I don't trust these guys to do

553
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,038
business with them it's just easier if

554
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,199
we don't and also the time has never

555
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,558
come up and I trust those two dudes the

556
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,798
three of us would never [ __ ] each other

557
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:24,440
we could all leave a pile of money on

558
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,200
the table nobody would rip each other

559
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,320
off I'm just using examples and being

560
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
hypothetical here but uh that's part of

561
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,439
why I don't collab with people problems

562
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,360
come up every time I've seen so many

563
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,200
friends lose relationships and friends

564
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,599
just over weird weed [ __ ] that was

565
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,558
unnecessary if this weird business idea

566
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,678
didn't happen this group of friends and

567
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,759
this group of friends would still be

568
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
friends and they'd be a [ __ ]

569
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,240
Powerhouse instead of two small groups

570
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,919
that'd be one [ __ ] super group all

571
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,038
right I rambled on enough about that

572
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,600
let's move on to part two there's a part

573
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,359
two of this question it says are there

574
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:58,000
any plans to restock Jack the Ripper on

575
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,000
iir hopefully I can grab a few packs if

576
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,240
so current at this time unfortunately I

577
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,759
do not have plans to restock any more of

578
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,120
the Jack the Ripper stuff I have the

579
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,400
Jack the Ripper mail but kind of going a

580
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,319
different direction I'm really focused

581
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,038
on feminized seeds right now fem are I

582
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,639
used to say 70% of the market fem are 85

583
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,798
or 90% of the market right now uh

584
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,960
regular seeds are not selling so if I

585
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,839
made more regs they would sit on the

586
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,360
shelf or they would be sold at a blowout

587
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
price it's really not worth it at this

588
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,119
time I love making reg seed I love

589
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,480
breeding regular plants but right now

590
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,158
the Jack the Ripper is not in the lineup

591
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm currently working with some fem

592
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,520
stuff the next run is Golden Goat um I'm

593
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,720
making a bunch of Golden Goat reversal

594
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,000
stuff there might be a Gary Payton in

595
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,759
that run uh there might be a GMO root

596
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,919
beer in that run who knows what else

597
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,879
there might be getting crossed to the

598
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,200
Golden Goat then following that I'm not

599
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,440
sure how much I've talked about this but

600
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,919
excuse me for burping not even going to

601
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,960
edit this out recently I found and

602
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,360
discovered in a close friend's grow a

603
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,840
phenotype of the cream that has got all

604
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,240
of the traits uh it's a n out of 10 it's

605
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,319
got everything you can imagine for a

606
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,798
breeding plant it's a female but I'm

607
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,798
going to reverse that cream and

608
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,918
pollinate everything in my [ __ ]

609
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,558
lineup with that bad girl so uh there

610
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,559
will be some Golden Goat crosses some

611
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,240
new Golden Goat stuff coming then

612
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,720
shortly after that we will have some

613
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,839
cream crosses those plants are in veg

614
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,038
now they're getting big enough to get

615
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,798
the clones and get everybody going but

616
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,200
that is what's coming up so no Jack the

617
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,319
Ripper for a while going to focus on fem

618
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,919
Golden Goat then the cream then maybe

619
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,399
more blueberry cookie stuff just

620
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,960
depending on how uh my creative juices

621
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,679
are flowing at the time and what pops up

622
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,278
between now and then all right so my

623
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,080
buddy Frank Wyatt I feel like I rambled

624
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:44,200
a lot on this answer um I don't work

625
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,359
with other breeders uh just because of

626
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,759
time and planning uh if there's somebody

627
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,918
out there that does want to do a collab

628
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,278
let's work on it but also I like the

629
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,360
idea that if you don't work with your

630
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,359
friends you can never break up with your

631
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,558
friends we're all in the friend zone we

632
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,000
keep business business and friendship

633
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:01,000
friendship all right I'm going to keep

634
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,240
moving I've got time for one more good

635
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,679

focused I'm getting goofy today the

652
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,359
message from my new friend MO says hey

653
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
rosta Jeff I love your podcast and the

654
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,399
genetics you put out hey that's pretty

655
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,038
awesome and ironic because guess what

656
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,880
you've got a coupon code for a free pack

657
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,158
of seeds from iir make sure you check

658
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
your inbox check that spam folder and

659
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,400
when you grow those seeds please send me

660
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,919
pictures and make me proud but wait

661
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,960
there's more it says thank you for

662
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,120
making me a better grower dude you are

663
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,558
very welcome that stuff means a lot to

664
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,359
me that is like pouring nutrients and

665
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,200
recharge on me you are very welcome now

666
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,519
it does go on it says I know you like to

667
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,120
finish your plants the last 10 days on

668
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,038
an 18 and6 light cycle what many people

669
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,278
may be new to the show so let me address

670
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,919
what this person just said when I am

671
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,640
finishing my plants the last 10 days of

672
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,120
the flowering cycle I will put my lights

673
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,600
back on 18 hours on and 6 hours off

674
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,239
you're on 1212 now I will put those

675
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,399
lights on 18 hours on and 6 hours off

676
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,480
that is right the last 10 days I

677
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,679
increase my lights by 6 hours many

678
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,159
people's heads just [ __ ] exploded

679
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
they're saying what are you doing you're

680
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,640
crazy I've been doing this for a while

681
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,319
there are a couple of caveats Let Me

682
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,520
Explain do not do this on the first run

683
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,839
of a plant do this when you know how

684
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,480
long a plant takes to flow when you know

685
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,319
how long that plant usually takes to

686
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,120
flow if it takes 70 days start this at

687
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:58,439
day 60 if the plant takes 80 days start

688
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,439
at Day 70 don't do this on the first run

689
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,038
figure out how long the plant takes then

690
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,519
the second and third runs that's when

691
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:06,599
we're going to mess with the light cycle

692
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:10,119
so what do I do the last 10 days it's

693
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,918
real easy I go from 1212 to 18 hours on

694
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,239
and 6 hours off people their heads are

695
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,759
just blown up why do you do this good

696
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,519
question because it is in my opinion my

697
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,720
experience that photons that light is

698
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,839
the number one source of energy for our

699
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,278
plants light is what makes the plants

700
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,158
grow if we put that light on for more

701
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,599
hours per day they will get more light

702
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
which means they will get more

703
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,558
photosynthesis which means they will be

704
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,759
more productive which means they will

705
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,278
get beefier more dense and they will

706
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,599
finish sooner you may be able to turn

707
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:43,558
that light off in day seven and cut down

708
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:46,000
your entire grow 3 days earlier than you

709
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,918
had anticipated because think about it

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
scientifically you're giving your plant

711
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,399
a half of day more light every single

712
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,640
day you may be able to cut off a quarter

713
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,759
of a day every day that that happens

714
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,038
just by the DLI that that plant is

715
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,919
receiving now many people think that I'm

716
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,879
crazy because I teach this method but

717
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,520
guess what everybody that has tried it

718
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,799
has messaged me and been like bro this

719
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,879
is awesome the only people that don't

720
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,278
like this idea are the people who have

721
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,960
not tried it so keep that in mind when

722
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,759
you're typing your hate mail right now

723
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,159
if you haven't tried it I don't care

724
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,798
what your opinion is try it then send me

725
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,159
some hate mail all right now let's

726
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,398
continue with this message because there

727
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,960
is more to this it says I know you like

728
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,759
to finish your plants on that last 10

729
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,679
days on an 186 cycle I am currently

730
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,278
Crossing some strains would you

731
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,600
recommend to switch from 1212 to 186 to

732
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,599
make the seeds finish more quickly my

733
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,959
quick answer off of the top of my head

734
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:43,480
without any hesitation is yes that's

735
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,919
exactly why and how I learned this

736
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,399
method I realize that the seeds like a

737
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,919
lot of light when I'm growing for seed I

738
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,038
don't care what the plants look like I

739
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,640
don't need pretty buds nobody's ever

740
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,640
going to see the flower nobody's ever

741
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,600
going to smoke the flow it's all going

742
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,399
to get ground up into dust and the seeds

743
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,359
are going to get pulled out you'll never

744
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:04,918
know what the herb looked like so I do

745
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,199
turn my lights back to 186 after

746
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,240
pollination I'll explain brief briefly

747
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,558
let me try that I'm not even going to

748
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,720
edit that I'm going to try that sentence

749
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,639
once again I will explain briefly how I

750
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,839
do this so uh the plants are ready for

751
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,000
pollination right we'll just

752
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,000
hypothetically say it's pollination time

753
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,720
ta pollinate them now I will wait 3 to

754
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,839
five maybe seven days depending on the

755
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,798
cultivars in the room I'll wait a few

756
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,798
days about a week then guess what

757
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,119
pollinate all over again take that male

758
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,440
plant dust everything or the Reversed

759
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:35,278
female whatever you want to do it my

760
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
pollen donor everybody just got

761
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,679
pollinated a second time now I will get

762
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,119
rid of that male or that pollen donor

763
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,519
plant that is gone we have just got

764
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,479
pollinated females in the room I will

765
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,960
wait until I see those pistols start to

766
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,038
turn brown and wither up that is when I

767
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,000
put that light back on 18 hours on and

768
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,278
six off usually two to three maybe 5

769
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,278
days after second pollination is when I

770
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,960
turn those lights back to 186 now people

771
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,759
are going what are you doing dude 186

772
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,480
they're going to rev yeah they will but

773
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,359
I don't give a [ __ ] because I'm not

774
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,360
growing for buds these plants are fully

775
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,959
seated they're going to make amazing

776
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,558
seeds big fat healthy seeds when you

777
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,399
guys buy seeds from me and you get those

778
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,918
big fat healthy seeds that are the size

779
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:18,839
of Pebbles those were grown under an 186

780
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,600
light cycle and I strongly believe that

781
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,918
it's because of all of that extra light

782
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,959
that light gives the plants extra energy

783
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,960
that extra energy gives them more

784
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,120
photosynthesis lets them get bigger

785
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,440
beefier stronger faster and earlier so

786
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,599
if you do this you may be able to

787
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
harvest your seeds a little bit early

788
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,759
one thing I will recommend is pay

789
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,959
attention because if you let them go too

790
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:41,119
long like this they will get too hard

791
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,480
and you will get germination issues if

792
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,558
you let them go too long if you're good

793
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,720
and I experienced it growing for seed

794
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:48,798
I'm sure you know how to pull a couple

795
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,679
of seeds out of a calx give it a squeeze

796
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,480
and see if it's ready just do not let

797
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,000
them go too long is my main bit of

798
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,679
advice but yes I definitely do recommend

799
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,558
switching back to 18 hours on and hours

800
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,038
off after the second successful

801
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,079
pollination you will notice that your

802
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,519
plants finish more quickly you'll notice

803
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,879
those seeds get big and beefy and also

804
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,480
here is an advantage if perhaps you

805
