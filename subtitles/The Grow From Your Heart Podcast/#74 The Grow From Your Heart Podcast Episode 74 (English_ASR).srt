00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,959
working a

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
night glad to make you laugh bro thanks

54
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,399
for the sugar we weren't going to stop

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
and get donuts but as we drove by we

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,718
could see into the building that there

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,920
was just one dude standing there staring

58
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,599
out the window watching traffic and I

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,799
predicted that if we waited 4 hours

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,318
without going he may kill himself

61
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,280
standing there staring out the window he

62
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,079
looked so sad and lonely we just had to

63
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,120
go cheer him up I bought some donuts and

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,280
Mike gave the dude a fat tip yep that

65
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,080
was nice of you well fat for peblo yeah

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,680
it was a donut tip I mean when I handed

67
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,360
it to him it was kind of clear that he

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,760
did not expect to get tipped on this

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,280
shift well then now he's got money for

70
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,560
whatever he does after work right he's

71
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,878
at least got a story to tell at the end

72
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,920
of the these two super high guys came

73
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:35,598
through and bought a lot of donuts part

74
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,518
of the directions were to fill the box

75
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,759
with something quote colorful that's

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,640
what I said I was like I want one of

77
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,719
these specific Donuts cuz they're tasty

78
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,518

79
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,080
colorful [ __ ] in the box and he met that

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,680

00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,359
on Wednesday they got an answer when a

165
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,719
judge threw out a lawsuit holding up the

166
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,479
implementation of the drug Jeff shy

167
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,560
started the medical marijuana Business

168
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,879
Association he's followed the entire

169
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,000
process of Charlotte's Webb from

170
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,000
lawmakers legalizing it last year to

171
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,279
several law suits from potential Growers

172
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,240
halting the sale of the drug to today

173
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,159
with a sale date in sight the rule that

174
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,560
was finally approved was fair and

175
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,840
balanced shy said it's been a long

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,439
discussion and dialogue it's been a long

177
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,239
discussion and dialogue and I know

178
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:06,240
there's been some frustration with it

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,519
but here are uh here we are with a rule

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
that's going into effect sorry guys I'm

181
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,359
trying to cough and read at the same

182
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,000
time uh we'll have people submitting

183
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
applications to become dispensaries and

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,519
I think Florida is ready for this

185
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,079
Florida's Department of Health has been

186
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,478
the agency in charge of implementing

187
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,159
Charlotte's Web they're expecting

188
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,639
they're expected to take applications

189
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,560
from eligible Growers within 3 weeks

190
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,199
under the law only five will be chosen

191
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,720
to sell it so pretty soon in Florida

192
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,960
there will be five dispensaries selling

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,240
Charlotte's Web medicine um I have mixed

194
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,279
emotions about this how about you Mike

195
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,038
you look like you got [ __ ] to say

196
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,598
already it's I mean I feel a little bad

197
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,120
because I didn't follow the story as

198
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,639
closely as I follow most Cannabis News

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,879
because it's another Charlotte's Web

200
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,000
state law and while any progress towards

201
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,598
medical marijuana access is huge and

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,639
awesome and it's another big win for

203
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:02,800
reality and science CBD only is silly

204
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,400
and just a it's a half step that no one

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,840
needs to take at this point California's

206
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,279
been medical since

207
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,038
1996 all of this CBD stuff in

208
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,839
Charlotte's Web came out of our medical

209
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,159
marijuana system here THC is fantastic

210
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,000
medicine and thanks to the vote last

211
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,759
year in Florida they've got CBD only now

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,720
thanks to this law but it's only

213
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,520
Charlotte's Web specific it's the only

214
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,800
strain they can sell and grow realm of

215
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,639
caring did an amazing job trademarking

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,478
and getting there name out and pitching

217
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,199
it as safe and not intoxicating um add

218
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,079
that and sanj Gupta together and we've

219
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,160
got 13 CBD only States no I know I said

220
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,158
I had mixed emotions uh one of my

221
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,680
opinions is like you said it's great

222
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,199
that we have medical marijuana in

223
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,120
Florida now so that these kids can get

224
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,960
their medicine and the parents don't

225
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,680
have to watch their children suffer and

226
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,478
the kids can live a happy normal life

227
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,319
but I don't think that CBD only medicine

228
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,598
is the way to go and also like you're

229
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,280
you're saying this one company that owns

230
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,399
the charlott's web is going to make

231
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,799
money off of this like crazy and that's

232
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,839
not a cool way to go about medical

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,840
cannabis well I mean if you really think

234
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,279
about it the article talks about the

235
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,598
kids but it's not just children in

236
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,198
Florida that would be accessing

237
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,360
Charlotte's Web medications through

238
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,439
these five

239
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,038
dispensaries there's all the adult

240
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,759
patients with all of those conditions as

241
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,478
well so you're talking about a huge

242
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:32,479
number of people five business or five

243
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:34,559
store locations one product brand it's I

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
mean are we going to run out oh for sure

245
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,879
there's going to be huge product

246
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,599
limitations and it's going to be like

247
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,038
two a ridiculous cost per gram like it

248
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,440
is out here I don't know the price off

249
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,000
the top of my head I almost threw out a

250
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,720
random number but I don't want to do

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,360
that because it's ridiculously high but

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,160
I don't want to be wrong about how

253
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,600
ridiculously high okay I'll let you live

254
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,719
with that answer yeah it's so there's

255
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,440
something that Mike said that the THC is

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
good medicine there's something I feel

257
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,800
about uh we used to call it the

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,679
Entourage effect in Colorado now the

259
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,000
industry term has moved to the

260
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:12,000
synergistic effect and that's the effect

261
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,159
of the canabo the paleet the terpenoids

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,440
the flavonoids and the Esters all

263
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,120
working together to provide you a

264
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,000
medicinal benefit and just by isolating

265
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,078
the CBD I don't think you're getting the

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,360
full benefit of the medicinal cannabis

267
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,319
and you're going to say it works with

268
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,560
the kids and the kids don't have

269
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,879
seizures yeah but for me CBD medicine

270
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,319
doesn't do anything for my medical

271
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,159
condition that I smoke for it works

272
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,560
great for me but it doesn't do

273
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,240
everything I need it to I need the THC

274
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,278
half of that puzzle as well yeah yeah we

275
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,560
see this with the there's been 100% thp

276
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,000
SE pill called Marinol on the market for

277
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:53,278
decades no one likes it because likes it

278
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,839
it doesn't have the rest of the canono

279
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,799
in it and they tried they tried sativ s

280
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,640
x I just called it sativa X you know

281
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,278
there's one company in Europe that's

282
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,278
doing a whole plant extract where um

283
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,480
they're taking the whole raw marijuana

284
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,159
plant and making some sort of uh I think

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
it's a sublingual spray is spraying

286
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,799
under your tongue like Baka nice um and

287
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,319
they were testing it for Ms the last I

288
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,479
read so there are companies looking at

289
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,720
whole marijuana plant extract rather

290
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,000
than isolating one or two components

291
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,800
does your friend Dave listen to the

292
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,278
podcast I have no idea he should well if

293
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,359
you do bro shout out I thought you when

294
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,278
he said that we've got a friend that

295
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,159
could benefit from this sublingual spray

296
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,759
for sure did I say that right sublingual

297
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,278
so y nice I just spat that one out yeah

298
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,919
so this is going to work for a lot of

299
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:47,120
people but I'm a medical smoker and I

300
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:48,439
definitely need my THC heavy sativas so

301
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,159
shout out for going the right direction

302
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,399
Florida for trying to do the medical

303
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,360
thing maybe this will open the door how

304
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,078
long do they have to just go with CBD

305
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,560
medicine is what I this is this is the

306
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,319
end of what they have going for now I'm

307
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,559
sure there's another uh group working

308
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,079
towards getting uh legalization on the

309
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,679
ballot in Florida either medical or

310
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,359
wreck again in the next Presidential but

311
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,278
I guess we can look at it this

312
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,879
way gosh excuse me guys I had sugary Dr

313
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,519
Pepper and donuts and my voice is

314
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,159
already all [ __ ] up from the

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,639
show but we can look at it this way the

316
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,399
sick kids who have seizures and epilepsy

317
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,759
and cancer and things like that that

318
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,278
need help can now get the CBD medicine

319
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,720
and the people like you and I that are

320
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,320
in our 30s that know people that know

321
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,240
some people uh that aren't we're

322
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
able-bodied we can go out and get some

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
herb you know what I mean so that's cool

324
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,959
the kids those kids needed it way more

325
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,319
than the folks that want the sativas so

326
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,159
I guess it does it helps a lot still I'm

327
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,959
a big fan but at the same time I

328
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,879
remember how many epilepsy patients used

329
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,359
to come into the shop I

330
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,278
remember I mean I remember them enough

331
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,399
to have research some of this stuff

332
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:59,480
after we left and THC is fairly

333
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,519
effective on treating seizures

334
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,278
yes and so having some THC in an

335
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,519
anti-seizure medication that's made from

336
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,278
Cannabis makes a whole lot of sense in

337
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,600
Charlotte's Web specific laws we didn't

338
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,399
end up with Charlotte's Web because it H

339
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,240
or we saw it working great for seizures

340
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,120
and dove into that they found it had no

341
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,680
THC and that certain medical patients

342
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,560
were looking for a non intoxicating

343
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,638
medication and they're afraid to give

344
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,119
the THC to the kids that's the big scary

345
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,399
part it makes a much better pitch when

346
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,519
there's absolutely no THC in there when

347
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,240
you can you just say straight up there's

348
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,039
no high to it you can take as much as

349
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,240
you want there's no intoxicating effect

350
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,559
but an intoxicating effect doesn't mean

351
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,079
non-medical effect it just means also

352
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,239
intoxicating all right let's get out of

353
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,638
Florida thanks Florida we've done a

354
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,720
couple minutes on that news topic I

355
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,799
don't want to bore the folks CBD was big

356
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,240
in the news this week yes uh CBD is

357
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,799
going to remain big in the news news I

358
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,399
think for the next little while what's

359
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,120
the next uh this is a random question

360
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,519
what's the next canabo to pop up that's

361
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,240
going to be popular I'm hoping it's CBG

362
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,600
that's what I was going to say um just

363
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,879
from what I've seen I I I had the Good

364
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Fortune to get uh a small sample of CBG

365
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,039
capsules very neat and uh it was during

366
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,279
a period of time where I had some bad

367
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,559
back pain and oh Lordy they helped me

368
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,679

369
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,919

371
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,879
like a baby yeah that was awesome maybe

372
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,679

too much sativa and taking the Alpha

375
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,839
Brain y one more reason to get

376
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
caregivers back into the testing lab

377
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,199
I've been talking about this Alpha Brain

378
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,799
and when I take it too late in the day

379
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:45,479
it gives me the most craziest

380
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,799
dreams uh so we just did an article from

381
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,959
Florida let's jump to our hometown here

382
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,319
in the lovely Steel City peblo

383
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:58,039
Colorado what's up

384
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,720
peblo 719 so the headline here is pelo

385
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,759
County wants to keep keep excess weed

386
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,199
money this article is by Jeff Tucker

387
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,919
from The Pueblo Chieftain and it says

388
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,439
Pueblo County will be asking voters

389
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,719
whether they want the equivalent of

390
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,360
about three spins of the city park

391
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,440
kitties ride or if they could rather let

392
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,320
or if they would rather let the

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,839
government use a little less than

394
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,040
$150,000 in excess marijuana revenues

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,839
for something else uh guys and AR from

396
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,439
peblo that's a local joke we've got a

397
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,160
park here with some kitty rides it cost

398
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
like 50 cents and they're saying that

399
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,679
they're going to write a check for about

400
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,560
three spins on those shitty rides or if

401
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,879
they'd rather let the city just keep the

402
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,919
money uh in the excess marijuana

403
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,078
revenues and use it for something else

404
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,198
so it says the peblo board of County

405
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,599
Commissioners instructed County attorney

406
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,278
Greg SAR on Wednesday to start work on a

407
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,320
ballot language that will give voters an

408
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,958
option on what to do with the marijuana

409
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,839
sales tax money they collected in

410
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:56,078
2014 as part of the of the exemption the

411
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,279
3.5% sales tax from the state taxpayers

412
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,638
Bill of Rights uh let's make sure I read

413
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,720
that right through 3.5% sales tax from

414
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,720
the state taxpayers Bill of Rights the

415
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,519
county made an estimated income of

416
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,680
$400,000 from the marijuana sales tax

417
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,919
collection in the first year of legal

418
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,599
recreational sales in Pablo County

419
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,799
$548,000

420
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,920
479 was collected from sales tax meaning

421
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,919
that

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,959
$148,400

423
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
uh let them keep it yeah let him keep it

424
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,359
maybe they can fill some of the damn

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,278
potholes that are all over this city

426
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,480
everywhere it's funny that you say that

427
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,480
the the county raked in a huge amount of

428
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,079
money it was like 1.7 million just in

429
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,039
pbl County last year from the marijuana

430
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,078
industry half of that was taxes half of

431
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:51,559
that was like fees and application fees

432
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,318
and things like that but uh pelo West

433
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,758
Metropolitan District wh that all the

434
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,439
shops were there but they weren't

435
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,079
getting a special cut so the County

436
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Commissioners broke them off like two or

437
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,758
300 Grand and they're Throwing It All

438
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,000
into their streets it's a great plan and

439
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,759
they need their streets repaired as

440
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,519
badly as we do they made a good argument

441
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,120
the shops are all here we want to cut

442
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,919
and so the county said here's your cut

443
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,078
and they said thanks for the road money

444
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,838
was it an extra shitty winter or are the

445
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,239
roads just not getting paid attention to

446
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,480
because they've been terrible here yes

447
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,278
okay I thought it was a little bit of

448
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,920
both one of the sided issues I've caught

449
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,159
down at city council is uh our roads

450
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,318
right now to get them up to speed at the

451
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,278
pace we're doing just to get the peblo

452
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,519
stuff in in order is going to take 50

453
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,519

peblo that's all over the nation that's

456

live in states that have reformed their

571
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,200
marijuana laws marijuana remains illegal

heads of all federal departments and

terms that marijuana use for the more

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,599

588
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,200
heart federal law on marijuana remains

589
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,798
unchanged she writes in a letter

590
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,558
announcing the guidance we've got four

591

one of them came with worker

594
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,559
protection so you can take any other

595
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,038
intoxicating medication you feel like or

596
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,359

598
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,278
be intoxicating so who's uh who how do

599
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,000

protection rules who does that that's

601
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,558

615
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
while four states have legal you just

616
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,439
read part of the article out of your bra

617
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,480
so uh federal employees are also part of

618
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,519
the drug-free workplace act guidelines

619
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,240
which ban any use of illegal drugs on

620
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,679
and off duty in general most of the

621
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,679
routine drug testing of federal

622
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,480
employees primarily occurs within

623
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,600
federal agencies that have personnel

624
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,640
with safety sensitive jobs like those

625
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,678
working in law enforcement or national

626
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,320
security this would be a good time to

627
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:54,640
mention to those of you living in not

628
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,119
Colorado thinking about moving to heaven

629
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,240
and uh for our wonderful weed laws that

630
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,879
uh have a job when you get here cuz

631
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,880
they're going to drug test just like the

632
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,480
one in Minneapolis or where wherever

633
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,000
you're flying from Texas yep I had a

634
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,159
friend that had to pass a drug test

635
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
yesterday in fact she's like how do I do

636
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,679
it I was like I don't I don't know if

637
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,159
they if I have to take a pest I don't

638
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,640
even want to work there I had to do that

639
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,960
back before dabs were a thing and Dab's

640
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,600
been a thing for a while so I've

641
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,038
probably forgotten exactly how to do

642
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,038
that now um my way of doing it is the

643
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,319
only way I can do it is use fake piss

644
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,319
it's the only way I've ever been able to

645
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,158
pass a p test you go by that fake pee

646
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,399
and keep it warm I just took breaks and

647
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,720
just I was just be sober it was never

648
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,480
that painful one time dude I went 63

649
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,600
days without smoking I don't want to try

650
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,839
fa a drug test and I really didn't smoke

651
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,959
everyone's like you had to have smoked

652
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,839
and I was like no I went to Reggae on

653
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,558
the rocks with my brother Bradley and

654
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,519
rolled down the windows when he puffed

655
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,158
and I did not puff at all he was

656
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,918
laughing at me and I still failed the P

657
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,159
test well I'm all right so if you're a

658
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,720
Fed in any way who else is a Fed we got

659

660
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,400
applies to all sorts of stuff C

661
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,839
dot uh there's a number of

662
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,440
different professions I suppose is the

663
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,599
easiest way to say it that uh have rules

664
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,240
that the feds get to lay out regulations

665
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,079
that the feds get to lay out and a lot

666
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,120
of it comes with tax breaks if and one

667
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,678
of those ifs is almost always drug-free

668
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,038
work workplace act which is why [ __ ]

00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:06,079
Oregon and it says man asks City to ban

689
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,399
fart smells for a good reason and this

690
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
came from The Huffington Post it's

691
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,759
written by Hillary Henson I really liked

692
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,079
this story the article goes like this

693
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,960
you guys are going to like this also it

694
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,439
says a resident of Pendleton Oregon has

695
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
written a letter requesting the city

696
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,759
council ban the smell of farts in the

697
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,880
community but he has good reason to be

698
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,599
raising a stink last week the city of

699
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Pendleton uploaded its nuisance

700
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,119
ordinance to cover the smell of

701
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,240
marijuana NBC reported at the time that

702
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,918
means that even though recreational

703
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,319
marijuana will be legal in Oregon

704
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,759
starting in July a person can be fined

705
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,398
up to $500 if someone complains they

706
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,079
smell marijuana coming from that

707
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,119
person's property in a letter published

708
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,759
in the East Oregonian on Thursday

709
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,599
someone who signed his name as Peter

710
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,558
Walters merely asked that council

711
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,759
members take the next logical step and

712
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,558
start regulating a far more noxious

713
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:57,240
scent it was with great relief Thursday

714
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,240
when I read the East Coast the East

715
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,079
Oregon

716
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,798
that Pendleton city council took the

717
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,038
time to pass an amendment to the city's

718
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,798
nuisance order Banning marijuana order

719
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,960
clearly there has been no issue of

720
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,480
Greater importance facing the city now

721
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,120
that this important work has been

722
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,278
completed I hope the council will move

723
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,798
on to restricting the other offensive

724
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,398
smell that plagues our community

725
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:21,639
farts Walters who is pretty clearly

726
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,599
mocking the marijuana ordinances notes

727
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,600
some habitual farters argue that they

728
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,759
need to fart for medical reasons but

729
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,519
that doesn't mean my kids should have to

730
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,038
smell their farts it's just beautiful

731
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,759
that's great if you're an elected

732
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,720
official and you behave absurdly people

733
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,599
have the right to mock the living [ __ ]

734
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,399
out of you by sending you public letters

735
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:46,319
asking you to ban the smell of farts uh

736
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:49,319
PUO last summer did we passed a smell

737
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,678
ordinance down here it's considered

738
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,319
automatically a yes that's definitely

739
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,000
offensive thing if your neighbor whines

740
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,678
about the smell of your pot garden um

741
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
you can be smoking marijuana on your

742
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,720
porch and that smell cannot be

743
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,558
considered automatically offensive but

744
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,600
growing marijuana is automatically

745
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:08,000
offensive by city

746
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,319
ordinance it's the only odor that you

747
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,839
can get in trouble for in PLO well if

748
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,278
this passes I pretty much can't go to

749
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,278
Pendleton

750
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:20,038
Oregon B I will be fined me oops 500

751
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,839
bucks every couple of minutes out of me

752
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,720
I'm a farting fool on some days I think

753
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,278
it's this vegetarian diet that's what do

754
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,360
it to me all right so uh pretty soon you

755
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,599
guys in Pendleton Oregon they're going

756
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,519
to and farts not really but I think

757
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,439
that's a great way to respond to some

758
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,398

867
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,720

868
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,158

grandma about it too tell like five

872
